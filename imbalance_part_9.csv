3.0,The metal is cheap but it was expected with the low price.
3.0,Not great. But not baf
3.0,"Really wanted to like them, as I have had Taos sandles before and love them.  Something about this pair did not look right on the side, like a little gappy on MY feet.  While they felt ok, I didn't care for the way they looked.  I returned them but will definitely will try another style in Taos."
3.0,The arms are tight. I don't have big arms and couldn't roll the sleeves up and use the straps. I roll it to 3/4. I like it other than that.
3.0,"Super cute dress, but it was too short. I’m 5’ 10” and ordered a medium."
3.0,Looks cheap.  I returned it.
3.0,Really wish it was shorter. It’s a strange length - it’s not a short dress it’s not a long dress it just hits funny on my shin. I’m 5 ft 4 inches.
3.0,Only eh. Cant adjust straps. It's only the velvet ones. I have purchased identical other tanks and they are perfect. Just a small flaw I suppose. Also the lace going into the velvet at the straps looks a little cheaply put together.
3.0,Would fit a man better other wise good
3.0,I bought 14-16 which is the size I wear but it is big I could have gone a size smaller.  I'm only 5'0 maybe<br />it would be perfect for a taller person.
3.0,Socks are like knee highs on my fiancé lol. Otherwise nice socks. Just thought they would be shorter
3.0,I wish I could leave 2 separate reviews for these shorts.  If I were to just review the outer shell it would probably be a 4.5 star review.  If I were to just review the biking shorts part it would probably be a 2 star review.  I will start with the biking short part.<br /><br />The fit was no where near snug enough.  I like the padding from my bike shorts to be nice and snug and held in place to hold everything else around that area in place.  These were very loose. If I pulled them up higher to get them snug I had to pull the waist band way above my belly button to get the padding where it needed to be.  Not the best<br /><br />The material of the inner shorts is also mesh.  I think this could be potentially really nice however do to the fit I will never know and will not wear the bike short inners.<br /><br />The outer shorts however were great.  I really like the fit of them and they are quite flattering in my opinion.  They were not too baggy but not too tight.  The material is very thin but a good workout material.  My only complaint about the shorts is the lack of pockets.  It does have a very small pocket right below the waist band on the back but it is very small and does not hold much.  Would prefer some regular pockets.<br /><br />Would not buy these for biking but for sure would buy for the workout shorts.
3.0,"This dress is cute, but the waist is not elastic. White is see through. Material is nice, but again no stretch.  I could hardly get this on and when I did, I almost dislocated my shoulder trying to get it off.<br />They need a side zipper or elastic waist.<br />I returned it."
3.0,These are very nice I bought them for myself but my boyfriend is always trying to take them now! Only problem is that the earings were 2 dollars and shipping was almost 8 dollars that was outrageous!!!
3.0,Good quality shirt but the print color was way off I ordered a blue print and it looks purple.
3.0,Thought this color would be orange but it’s yellow. Disappointed.
3.0,"The pictures don't show this, but the material is see-through. Returned immediately."
3.0,"This costume is well made and worked perfectly, BUT, it runs about one whole size too small.  I originally ordered a size M but was sent a L. Luckily, because it runs larger it worked out."
3.0,Several months ago I ordered my normal size. That was too small. I decided to go two up. Now they're too large. I give up.
3.0,"I usually wear M Petite but they don't have petite size.  Small size fits well except around the armpit.  It exposes the folds under arms more than I would like.  If they made petite sizes, it would have been perfect.  As to the fabric, I thought it would be lighter for summery weather.  Although the elasticity is convenient, the fabric is very thick and I am not sure if I can wear it in hot weather."
3.0,I had previously ordered this in a large and it was too big.  Medium was big too... cute though!
3.0,These are NOT oversized at all! But they are cute. But I probably wouldn't purchase them again. The quality is decent for the price as well.
3.0,"I have the square ones. They are cute, but the earrings are very heavy. Definitely not for all day use."
3.0,"The tie is fine. It's a little on the short side, and the fabric isn't the highest quality, but you get what you pay for! I'm using it for a Harry Potter-themed cosplay outfit and it suits just fine for that!"
3.0,I like the shirt but it is baby pink not heather pink
3.0,Product kind of cheaply made and not true to size!
3.0,"A little bit small for the &#34;one size&#34;. I am 5'1, and about 125- 130 pounds.......not large at all. Would be better if it was a trifle bigger. Other wise it's cute."
3.0,I really like the frames and color of the lenses but they seriously look like you are wearing them upside down. Really annoying having people giggle and ask if your glasses are on upside down.
3.0,"Is nice but Is polyester, and is not so fresh than satén or silk"
3.0,They are good for the price the lens isn't strong enough but it does the job
3.0,"The top is not at all long-sleeved as described, more like 3/4 length. The pants fit my kid well, especially because he's on the slim side."
3.0,"Reviews that warn to order a size larger are correct.  Also the support pouch is small and will not fit 50% of American males, that is: mid range to larger endowment."
3.0,Runs small no stretch
3.0,"Pendant is beautiful. Smaller than I thought it would be, but still very nice. Chain is good quality, but would probably only fit a child’s neck. Expect to buy a new chain to go with this pendant before wearing it unless you want a choker."
3.0,They’re a cute but am not going to be wearing them cause of the bad quality material
3.0,Nicely made however; very light and weak
3.0,"I ordered my normal size and it’s just a little too small. It’s short, which I don’t like. I’m short with a short torso and it’s too short. Unfortunately, I won’t wear this sweater. It can be washed normally but needs to be laid flat to dry, which I did. It’s thick and seems well made. Make sure you know your measurements before you order."
3.0,I am pleased with the hand bag. It is light weight and easily holds the things I find necessary to carry.
3.0,"Love the concept, but once you clip it to your badge it's so heavy that it pulls down the string so it hangs. Would be better if it was a little lighter. I wore mine for about a week ."
3.0,"Like the style,  just to let ever6know it's not cotton short. What I dislike it runs small get a bigger size than usual"
3.0,Some glue or resin is showing through and all it is is a plastic rose stuck to a ring. Not high quality at all but cute otherwise.
3.0,I love it but I ordered a size 12 but got a size 10
3.0,"Gorgeous but is very different for them picture. I got the smallest size possible and it’s enormous. Not fitted waist , more of a box dress. I tried shrinking it but didn’t help. It’s very long as well. I had my mom Taylor it and she had to remove 25 percent of material ."
3.0,"Fabric is very prone to wrinkles, ironing required."
3.0,"They look good but two came broken and they're incredibly difficult to snap closed. If you're on a budget and want a couple cute pieces, go for it, but if you're looking for something more user friendly, I'd splurge on a better quality set."
3.0,fluffy and soft.
3.0,These worked well for my father's flip phone. Easy to access. These do take some time to get. Would purchase again.
3.0,"It was recommended to get a larger than normal size and I can attest to that. I ordered 2 sizes larger and they just fit comfortably. The one pocket is ok, wish there was another, and it barely fits my iPhone 8+ with the case on. So be aware if you choose to use the pocket for that.<br />Otherwise they are holding up fine for weeknight rides."
3.0,"Comfortable, but one of the zippers broke after 3rd use."
3.0,"Unless you have skinny calves, don't purchase.  I have average size calves for someone that is 5'3.  Nice boot but definitely made for women with smaller than average calves."
3.0,The hat and headband is too small and the rest is too big. Overall my 8 month old can wear it all but it’s tight on her head and the pants fit her leg length but the waist band fits above her belly button so it covers up the lettering on the onesie. But it’s a cute outfit.
3.0,The stone is authentic and very nice but the silver top and loop have a cheap look.  I have hesitated to use it because of that.
3.0,A bit flimsy and needed a different size
3.0,Looks good fits snug size up definitely
3.0,"I like the shirt, but it was a bit big around the neck, and long for my taste.  It's more like a man's shirt to me compared to Unisex.  I would have preferred this style shirt in a women's cut."
3.0,Seem cheaply made
3.0,Love the colors and materials. However to big for my head :-(
3.0,Cheaply made fit isn’t right
3.0,love the retro look. but if you are not heavy chested steer clear.
3.0,Not true to size just a bit tight but keeping it. It’s a nice top.
3.0,"Nice quality, but this shirt runs VERY SMALL! I ordered the XXL and it barley went over my shoulders. I typically wear a M/L"
3.0,Wished I could of given it 5 stars honestly. Says for kids/youth. Got a medium but it's a medium for like an adult. Graphics are pretty good. No complaints in that department. Sucks it will fit big. Hopefully he grows into it.
3.0,"These are cute, but having a shiny leather on the sole of the shoe makes these pretty slippery for young, learning walkers. If you are only into the aesthetics then these are ok, but they won't be great on hardwood floors or concrete."
3.0,"Color is vibrant, the back is interesting. The front looks like an oversize tank top. Didn't like it very much. More like a nightgown."
3.0,"Decent product. Does its job, but is a pain to form to your earpro."
3.0,"Lasted three months. For the price, I suppose that's not bad. Now have holes in the sole, and the fabric is starting to separate from the sole around the toes. They were comfortable though."
3.0,"While this is a perfectly lovely scarf, I will probably give this away.  The birds and the trim are gold on the gray scarf and it looks garish to me.  It looked silver with my monitor settings so I'm not going to count off for that.  Had they used silver rather than gold, I would have given 5 stars."
3.0,"Unfortunately, I will be returning these. The back is much narrower (""stringier""?) than the item photos would lead you to believe. Quality seems pretty decent at a glance. Definitely agree with the other reviews here - I typically wear medium, I ordered this in small and it fit me just right."
3.0,The band is made of very cheap materials. Looks nice though
3.0,This is not a toddlers hat.
3.0,"Not as cool as I thought it would be, but functional"
3.0,It's cute and the color is very nice too but it's  very small. Works great if you are very petite person.
3.0,This dress is very confortable and it is easy to throw on. The material is nice and thick and looks like good quality. Did very well in the washer but looks like color would fade over time. This dress is more for a young crowd as I found it to not look flattering. It almost felt like a maternity dress and I wasn’t too fond of the ruffling under the bust. Overall this dress is ok.
3.0,"I wear a 10 or 10 1/2. Got an 11 and it just fits.  A little squeaky as you walk, but i use them for pool shows so idc."
3.0,"Didnt fit as loose as i was hoping, still like it though."
3.0,fun and colorful -pro<br />the insides of darts were small we had to shove a pencil in to make it fit our nerf brand shooters-con
3.0,The nose guards and ear tips fell off easily and they weren't as comfortable as expected but I go many compliments. Good value for price.
3.0,Quality isn't very good.
3.0,The quality looks acceptable! But i had a hard time to attach the leather band to the metal frame from the top! I expected better quality of the leather! Anyway it sounds good at the end but next time i may seek a better brand/quality
3.0,"There was no half star...so it had to get a 3! The quality it good, they are not as long as they appear in the images, but a decent length. The only major issue it that they bleed...and got all on my pillows. Which either forces me to live with stained white pillow cases or spend money in an area i didn't intend to."
3.0,"Pictures in ad show solid dark purple, but, as mentioned in other reviews, there is a white band on top and bottom and elastic ear loops are white. I should have read more reviews. I will use them, but I am disappointed."
3.0,"Cute dress, but definitely size up. The zipper was broken on mine, they replaced it before I even returned the first one."
3.0,"these colors look great.  nice and colorful except the black,  which is nice and .... Black."
3.0,The Chinese labels are confusing
3.0,Bought as a gift from my husband. The top surprisingly fit well but the bottoms where really really small. Adorable bathing suit for someone smaller.
3.0,"These look a little weird up close, plus the colors are wacky. (Belle is green...., Cinderella is strange)"
3.0,Loved the classy look. Material feels nice on the body. Wish it was black.
3.0,I couldn’t get a smooth visor bill.  It was also a bit larger than I anticipated.
3.0,The color faded an became splotched after wearing for only a month or so.
3.0,"It looks really cute but it doesn't fit well around the neck and shoulders, it is loose and pulls down"
3.0,"They fell apart easily, and frequently, but they are easy to put back together. Other than that, pretty good clip-ons."
3.0,Excellent material just too small of a band
3.0,"The Zircon gems on this ring are really uncomfortable. They poke into the fingers on either side. It's a beautiful sparkling ring though, so I'm thinking about wearing it on a chain as a necklace."
3.0,Pretty but too heavy - kept falling out of my hair
3.0,"This robe is cute, colors are vibrant but very thin and no pockets."
3.0,This is nice graphically but is a bit thin and all polyester.  So summer weight.
3.0,My order arrived in just a couple of days....product was packaged well.  The only thing is that I expected them to be a bit larger than this.....I am attaching a picture so that others can buy with additional information.  Will keep as I like them...just not quite what I expected.
3.0,"I bought the green color based on the photo color which is a greenish grey, but the actual item was a pretty straight up forest green. The texture wasn't terrible but I think my pashminas are less scratchy. It seemed well made."
3.0,This dress is really pretty. But it's quite see through on the bottom and you could see my underwear through it. Also if you have big boobs like mine parts of your bra will show. I have 36 ddd mom boobs so I can't go bra less. I might still ware it one day with shorts but it didn't work for what I bought it for.
3.0,"Bought three for my 9 year old daughters. Two letters of the three have already broken. They do wear them 24/7 and they get tangled in their hair, so could be an age thing. They love the necklaces though."
3.0,"My daughter was happy with the pony design on it. However, I didn't like that the pants went loose in few hours of wearing them. The top is bright but the material is somewhat cheap, it looks worn out after the first wash."
3.0,These are too big for my 10 month old.
3.0,"I like the look of the  earrings,  but I had to adjust the clasp, so I could get them on and off my ears."
3.0,Look nothing like the pic
3.0,I have mixed feelings I like that it came quicker then the expected date and I like that they are assorted by size. How ever I did not get the 4g which just happens to be the size I’m stretching to  so I was completely disappointed when I couldn’t stretch.. and no one has yet to email me back :( idk if you open on weekends but I’m pretty sure I emailed 3 days ago
3.0,Very cute. Very comfortable. Fit well for my small feet. Ripped on first use for two pairs. Haven't used a third yet. Very cheap and flimsy quality.
3.0,"It was really cute, but def make sure to order larger size.  I normally need a large top, so I ordered an extra large after reading other reviews.  The bust area was still too small.....I am a 34C and it was snug on top. The bottoms were a bit big due to having to order one size for both the top and bottom.  But overall I'm satisfied and would order from the company again."
3.0,"I ordered a size up as suggested by prior reviews, but they don't fit quite right. I have wider feet, and though an even bigger size would be okay. I barely fit. I suggest that if you have feet that aren't entirely narrow, order carefully. I'm a size 8, and order a size 8.5 to accommodate for my wide feet, and ordered these in a size 9. These shoes are wearable, but I fear of breaking them prematurely with my not-so-narrow feet."
3.0,This hat was ok. I thought it would be longer. It was also itchy to wear so I returned it.
3.0,Love the look of the shades quality is meh lens popped out did not stay in place on arrival required much manipulation of the frames to get the lens to mostly not pop out
3.0,The shorts are ok. These are not top quality but they'll due. The legs are wider than i expected and there not as long as pictured. I dont how they're going to wash and wear because i just got them. Maybe after i wear and wash i'll write another review.
3.0,The material is fantastic. Does have stretch. The rise was just too short for me.
3.0,Picture for the boots showed black. Saw the grey pu in the description but thought it was for the grey lining not the boots. Other than having a misleading picture the boots are great.
3.0,"The fit of the shirt was perfect, but I was expecting a prettier wine red color, not straight maroon. Return process was a bit of a hassle, so I'll probably just dye it.  It did come with a cute pair of earrings that I was not expecting, so that's nice."
3.0,Didn't like the look. Sent it back.
3.0,Far too short for XL
3.0,The zippers are kind of in comfortable and the neck line feels weird.
3.0,Too strong.  Returned.  Require bifocals.
3.0,"Arms are very tight, not in balance with size of the shirt. Bought an XL and XXL. Arms on both about the same. Very tight. Pattern in picture DOES show that the pattern on front and back do not line up, but, it's even more obvious when you have it on."
3.0,"Really cute, but didn’t last. Broke after a few uses"
3.0,File like green color does not fall the way I had expected. A tad bit itchy but that’s a personal preference not a product flaw.
3.0,"I like the jumpsuit except for the zipper.  The zipper is not sewn to its full length, making the jumpsuit difficult to pull up over my (average-sized hips).  I will need to have it adjusted in order to be able to wear it."
3.0,These masks are poor quality and itchy. It took over a month to get them. It was not worth the money.
3.0,"I've been wearing it every day. Taking it off when I wash my hands and take showers, but it still has tarnished where my other fingers touch it. It's a cute, adorable little ring though. So I'll just hit it with clear nail polish."
3.0,The goggles didn’t work very well in the ocean but where fine in the pool
3.0,"This item did not fit as expected, the support was not as expected.  I think it would work better for women with smaller bust."
3.0,Not quite as I thought reference to the picture.
3.0,Had to buy this twice because my first pair ripped at the top after only a couple of uses. And now I have a third one that is starting to rip. I really like how they feel though.
3.0,"These shorts are nice...they look and fit great...I like the zipped pockets too.  BUT, fast drying they are not!  When I workout, I sweat profusely, and I do have a few pairs of shorts that work well for people like me.  These shorts do not fit that category.  They soak up sweat like a sponge and they become heavy and saturated, just like any other regular (cheap) pair of shorts.  I’m a bit disappointed in these shorts for that reason."
3.0,I had to take a sewing needle to a couple spots to make it fit correctly.  Stitching was off on arrival.
3.0,"The shorts were nice, however, they are not properly sized. You will definitely want to order a bigger size then you would normally wear."
3.0,Super small xl is more like a medium
3.0,not very well
3.0,"Let me start by saying this shirt is very pretty. The problem is, the sizes are large. I had ordered a 10-12 (US) but the tag says 3XL. Ouch. I’m going to send this one back and order an 8-10 (US). And also order it in white since I like it so much. I have a hard time lifting my arms over my head to get shirts off, so I love that this shirt has a zipper to loosen it for me. My husband still has to help me unzip it though. Haha. My only other complaint is the length of time it took to get to me. I am spoiled by amazon prime 2 day, so I was a little impatient with this one and saddened that I have to send the one I did receive back, and wait even longer for one that fits. :(<br />Oh well. First world probs."
3.0,"The watch looks fine. But i have a few problems with it. I got it for myself, but the wrist band was so tight. Normally watches come with loose band. And you have to tighten it if you need to. But this just was too tight for me to use. It’s not worth returning. So i gifted it to a friend. Also, the packaging was terrible. The box was dented."
3.0,We ordered the 18-24 month size for my 15 month old to wear for her sister's birthday party. The outfit is precious but it's short in the torso and was hard to snap. Also the first time I took the cape off one of the snaps ripped right out of the shirt.
3.0,My granddaughter loves these but runs small.
3.0,For the cost....its what I expected.
3.0,"Super cute top, my cleavage game is on point in this shirt!..size runs a bit on the small side but, it still fits well.<br />Ships from china. Not sure what material it is but, it's a bit itchy...so I wear another little tank top under to avoid any irritation...because of the material I give it 3 stars, if it didn't feel like a wool sweater it would be 5 stars."
3.0,It's ok;  seller did fine. Earring is thicker than I hoped. I wanted it flat against the tragus.
3.0,"Great Watches, but one arrive not working! I like the deal and they arrived before Christmas. The color and style caught my eye and the eyes of others. I have even worn the blue....even though it doesn't work."
3.0,I like that they look as described but arrived with a spike missing and No more in stock
3.0,First wash in the gentile cycle the color fades. Stitching began to come loose. With repeated wear will last you no more than a summer.
3.0,This dress would have been better if I had ordered an extra large even though I wear a large same with both dresses very cute though
3.0,Shoe size runs small.  Ordered  a 10.5 returned it for a 11.  I wear a size 10.5 in most tennis and dress shoes.
3.0,For the price it is what it is. A neat little bracelet that falls apart no matter what you do within a month.
3.0,The color works and the length is great but it's little bit big on me.
3.0,A nice size purse !however very flimsy has no way of staying up when tying to load files or books
3.0,"These things are huge, I'm a guy (6'2"", 280#), and these still feel almost too large on my arms"
3.0,"So pretty.  Color and shiny. BUT, after only about 8 months I noticed they’d started losing the stones. Very disappointed."
3.0,The only thing that I disliked was the way the charms were attached to the chain. I would have preferred a<br />different way. If the chain breaks it would be difficult to reattach them.
3.0,"It’s actually not very attractive on. Very oddly fitted and tight on neck. Fabric is screen printed, which looks cheap. If you really want it, order way up for the oversized look."
3.0,Warm but shrank significantly after washing- had to give to my kids
3.0,It fites too large but I made it work because I loved it.
3.0,"These fit nice, and are durable and comfortable, but if you have slender fingers, then the thumb may be too short for motorcycling use.  This is a common problem with motorcycle gloves.  If they are sized to fit snug, the thumb of the throttle hand becomes sore after about an hour of riding, because the glove is putting pressure on the tip of the thumb.  More expensive brands typically cut the thumb a little longer."
3.0,Inexpensive and are good. However some of them are covered in little tiny spots.
3.0,Like the fit some what could be a little bigger.  Price too high
3.0,"This looks cute on. When I first got it, it felt super scratchy. It got a little softer once washed. It doesn’t breathe well and can hold in a lot of heat."
3.0,"However, the bodice fit perfectly but the bust was too large and too rigid- like it was old lace, that's the only way I can describe it. I will still need a bra and camisole underneath.<br /><br />I had the train removed/tailored."
3.0,Wish the shirt washed up better. Some if the lettering peeled off.
3.0,Love the skirt but it's not true to size!!
3.0,"This dress is cute. It’s okay. I guess you really get what you pay for. The color is the color you order. Only issue is the material is so thin, not so thin you see through it, but just feels cheap."
3.0,Leather was extremely soft and thin. Stretched out and didn’t feel secure. Seems kinda cheap. If your looking for a thin leather strap this would work well for you.
3.0,"I would have loved these- the material is super light (almost like wearing paper jeans but in a good way) but the size was off- a small seemed to be more of a size 8+. If they had fit, I would be wearing them every day possible!"
3.0,"It's cute & I get compliments on it everytime I wear it. My issue is the denim is pretty stiff & kind of uncomfortable. Also the hem is poorly sewn so the bottom tends to flip up after washing/drying. Forget vanity sizing, make sure you order based on measurements. I'm 5'3&#34;, 130 lbs, usually wear a US size small. I had to order a large & it fits fine."
3.0,Image printed poorly but they're still cool.
3.0,my wife wore these for our wedding. i wasn't impressed by the quality but wasn't disappointed either. she loved them and they looked great.
3.0,"Bought for husband, he wears 3xl they were too small. I wear xl and fit me perfect. So I got new pair but now to find him some that will fit"
3.0,Larger than I would have liked.
3.0,I didn't order this
3.0,"Ordered it in rose gold, but the color is copper."
3.0,"These are too big for my kids (both wear a size small range of adult glasses) and the adjustable part did not minimize enough for their heads.  If you're wanting a close fit for kids, this won't work."
3.0,Dress is cute but see through
3.0,Husband so happy with this! I got him as a gift and he loved it! Linen quality it’s so good! The fabric it’s better than I hoped so I’m very happy as well! Ordered a large and it fits just right! It’s comfy and cute!
3.0,I think it's worth pointing out that the two chains are rather chunky (thick) and they get wrapped around each other easily during wear. Aesthetically it would have been much better for this necklace to have very delicate chains. I cannot wear this with a collarless shirt as I feel like I need the collar to hide the chunkiness.
3.0,got holes easily
3.0,I have my ears to a 0g and they Kept falling out of my ears at night. The quality is pretty good. I’d love them if they stayed in my ears
3.0,"It’s more silver, and a bit scratchy. I have sensitive skin."
3.0,"Just as described, not a bad product"
3.0,Definitely too big. Ordered a 18-24month for my daughter who usually fits 24 month & it's way to big. The headband ran small too. It's super cute though & I'm going to be ordering in the next size down.
3.0,"Sizing is good but my biggest disappointment was the color. It looks very rose/pink in the picture, which was one of the most attractive parts of this mama for me. In reality, it is very earthy with beige and green being the primary colors that emerge."
3.0,"This tie is pretty cute.  Got it for the husband and expected more than just a print type on a tie.  It feels cheaper than expected as well.  It is still a cute tie and he's going to wear it but we've had better Amazon ties.  Not that we normally get them here but it seemed fun.  It will probably last a while since once it's tied, it never comes untied, according to the husband."
3.0,"The wallet is nice. The picture shows a different finish for the Walnut Wood vs the one I got. I like the one I got, but both sides have a different wood finish which Is obvious. I would've preferred if the whole wallet was the same finish. Just makes it look better, right now it looks like there are two colors on the wallet."
3.0,Love this dress but runs small on top and  above knee to shirt for me
3.0,The necklaces and bracelets are great but the flowers on the rings and earrings came off right out of the package. Easy to glue back on but a pain.
3.0,This looks very cheap and I regret purchasing it.
3.0,"Ordered a medium based on size reviews. About a size 4 in womens, 36C, athletic build but more than enough to fill out in all the right places. Dress was large and just looked like a paper bag on me. Colors were nice though. I would suggest order 2 sizes and return one."
3.0,"Good quality and very comfortable.  However, don't expect a 4"" lift as advertised.  Maybe 1 1/2"" if that."
3.0,I have 5'2 136lbs. I got size large. I do have big thighs. I am short but the length wasn't as long as others. I had to really shimmy in. I ended up ripping them before a performance. If I had a bigger size they may have been better. Very cute and professional smoothness.
3.0,"I'm not pay attention with the color, i though is beige but not to bad size fit perfectly!"
3.0,Cute dress just to small.I sent the dress back with no problem. I will buy from them again.
3.0,"Nicely designed, but frankly it looks better in the picture than in 3D reality.  A little on the cheap side, but fun to wear, esp for a kid."
3.0,On the small side order next size up.  beautiful shoes.
3.0,Was a little smaller than expected but overall nice. It is see through however so nust a heads up.
3.0,It very cheap material even if you get the more expensive one. The fit is a little big for how short the sleeves reach.
3.0,Esperaba mejor calidad
3.0,"Gloves are gloves, so it’s good, only down fall is some came with tiny holes, and they break easily."
3.0,Strap was twisted and way to short for me. Returned it with no trouble.
3.0,It's very very comfortable but if you have pets that shed I don't suggest you buy this the hair and the fur stick all into the material and it's very hard to get it out it also shrinks in the waist when you put it in the washing machine the elastic tends to bunch up
3.0,I bought it for regular wear in school for my daughter but the quality is not as good as I thought on the base of price
3.0,Works good. Only thing is it rolls up when you sit down or bend over bit for the price it's not bad
3.0,The dress itself is cute. I ordered a small and it’s too big.
3.0,"Since this product is manufactured in China, the pouch is sized for a 12 year old!  Look at the size chart for the waist size, but the pouch is not larger as you would expect."
3.0,"The dress is kind of pretty and looks like the picture. Unfortunately, the small size does not fit me and runs large. I look like I'm wearing two sizes too large in that dress, and I normally wear xs to s depending on where the clothes are from. The front goes way too low and extra fabric all around just made the dress hang awkwardly on my body.  I'm 5'4&#34; 105 lbs with a small frame. I'm sure it will look very nice on with more curves than me. :&#60;"
3.0,I feel that the shirt is a little small. I bought it for my sister.
3.0,It's a nice ring but looks a lil different in person.
3.0,"Nice looking shirt, but fits awkwardly, constantly pulling it forward."
3.0,It’s nice but super small and I mean small!
3.0,Nice bracelet I liked the beads but the charms were entirely too short. They didn't hang the way they should and looked awkward
3.0,"Fit great. Takes some breaking in so that they don't hurt your ankles, but other than that, really good boots at a great price."
3.0,"I generally like this bath wrap.  It certainly is lightweight as described, but it does border on a little too thin.  It can be a fine line between ""lightweight"" and feeling ""cheap"" and it is hard to explain why it feels more ""cheap"" than ""lightweight"".  I think part of it is that the fabric isn't as soft as I expected, even after washing/drying it. I hoped that it would soften up after washing it, but it really hasn't.  Is it uncomfortable? No.  But it doesn't exactly feel like you're pampering yourself either.  It also isn't very absorbent, but I wasn't expecting it to be, so that's fine for my purposes. The Velcro strap is nice and thick and stays connected while moving around.  I do have some issues with one of the corners scratching my skin if I don't fully cover it with the other side.  So I often find myself having to undo and redo the Velcro to make sure I don't get scratched.  I'm hoping that with time it softens up.  I do like the generous sizing which completely covers all the ""parts"" from my kids even when I'm moving around.  The pocket is also nice and it easily fits my plus size iPhone or glasses."
3.0,It's a 2 pack so i guess I'm ok with the fact that one hat fits perfectly and one hat is too small.  They are labled as the same size but are definitely not the same.
3.0,I am built on the more curvier side than the model in the photo. But I must say this dress is very nice. Just fits and looks a little different because of my build.
3.0,They were way too small. Much smaller than the 4mm earrings I have purchased in the past. These had to be 2mm.
3.0,"These were darling, but they were way too small. I ended up giving them to two  nieces, and they love them."
3.0,Broke within 2 days...
3.0,"Like the design a lot.  However, very disappointed that it has tarnished already."
3.0,"Sized for a child. Even if you put it on the last hole, it's still extremely small."
3.0,Dress is so pretty! Hopefully will be able to get it taken in so that way it stays up. I also wish the mid section for the torso was a bit longer or that the breast cups were larger.
3.0,"I had high hopes from this dress but to summarize it was a bit of a let down at least the particular piece I received.  The title of the review sums it all up.  The dress is a bit too tight and therefore the slit separates out too high up and it looks cheap.  Fitting and fabric are the two most important things in a dress and it at least fallers in one of them.<br /><br />Aside that, the fabric quality is reasonable, there's a bit of shine in the dress which of course is good for party wear.  The color grey is a very in color and therefore looks really good.<br /><br />It is completely body hugging dress which will leave a good impression and is good for late evening parties.<br /><br />The length of the dress is also good.<br /><br />Overall a good dress spoiled by it being a bit too tight"
3.0,"We did a cruise-themed murder mystery party, and my husband was supposed to be the captain. I bought him this set in a size up from his normal size, and it was still too small for him. It sufficed for the party, but he did look something like a sausage. Considering the price, it's a good product, but it's way too small. Be sure to size up when ordering."
3.0,Meh. They work for what I wanted but they are definitely see through.
3.0,These sneakers are cute. BUT The problem is that they're slippery indoors. I allowed my 2 year old 2 wear them inside to see if they fit and were comfortable. I have hardwood and tile. She was slipping all over the wood floors but I thought it might be because I just washed them. But she slipped and fell flat on her face in the tiled kitchen. They were fine on the street but I don't think I would let her use them on the grass as I'd worry about her slipping.
3.0,"I really like this idea, but the closure in the front rolls up & twists."
3.0,Nice for price but smaller than expected.
3.0,I love the design but the body around the middle was a bit small. The neck was a little large so if I would have gone up a size it would not have fit.
3.0,This mask is cheaply made and you can barely see the image as it is very dark. For a $15 mask I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. Not worth it at all.
3.0,I love the color and the stretch of the material. However if you’re looking to avoid camel toe these are definitely not the pants for you. Also I would recommend to order a size up
3.0,"This is weird but i bought the blue#3 halter dress with the floral pattern because i liked the dress in the review picks. The dress the other women received is clearly a different pattern then the one in the main photo. Sometimes these dresses are knock offs and I liked the reviewer's dresses better so I bought it thinking that's what I would receive too. Turns out I got the dress in the main photo, so I will be returning it. I'm 5'6 140 and ordered up with a large and the dress did fit well."
3.0,"This is a colorful mask, and it's comfortable, but it's very thin and won't offer any protection."
3.0,"Looks very nice and the recipient loved it - silver started wearing off after not too long, though."
3.0,It's great except for the fact that when I take it off my wrist it stops working!
3.0,"Seriously guys, only two sizes? Common, I do love Metallica and I really wanted the T-shirt, but getting a size S (a small one), was out of the question, so I took the large one. The positive: the T-shirt fabric is of good quality, the print is also very good.<br />The negative, only two sizes available?"
3.0,"Ordered a Large after measuring myself and looking at their size chart. Im not a big person, pretty small in the shoulder (but Im pretty busty so I ordered larger than I thought I'd need) and the bottom of the shirt was so small and no stretch so really hard to get on. I'd say their Large is more like a  mens Small (my husband, who can wear a medium got it on and it fits him like a Small, it's also very short on him.) There is ZERO stretch to this as well. Ample room in the shoulder/chest area but very slim at the bottom.<br />Otherwise, it was well made and super soft, I got the Ichimatsu hoodie and it was more of a lavender color, not very purple. I'd return it but I can't see myself paying to ship it back to China. =/"
3.0,"The quality of the fabric is kind of cheap.<br />The structure of it is okay but I don’t know if I could truly call it a blazer.<br />Overall, it’s just ok. I would not recommend purchasing. There are other better alternatives out there"
3.0,"Here's the thing....I like the swimsuit I recieved.  I got it for my daughter and even though the sizing is so wonky that I had to order a 4x for an eleven year old, I still like it.  But they didn't send the bathing suit that's pictured.  It's the one I ordered.  When I recieved it, it was dark blue with cherries and I looked at it and thought ok that's the bathing suit I ordered.  I was ok with it but my problem came a few days later after my daughter had swam in it about five times.  I was looking at the skirt and realized how uneven it was it was like they just hand cut it.  There was no stitching and it was a bit uneven. So I go to look at the picture and notice THERE IS NO SKIRT.  THen I look closer and realize the swimsuit I ordered was black, had different cherries, no skirt and was a halter.  The swimsuit I got was dark blue has regular straps, different cherries and it was more a swim dress.  Since she's worn it so many times, I wasn't going to try and return it.  I checked the number on the bag and it's the right stock number, so when ordering this I don't know what you will get.  Besides<br />the unevenness of the skirt and the fact they sent me a totally different suit, my daughter likes it.  Probably is better then the one I originally picked out.<br /><br />I recieved this product for free in exchange for a review"
3.0,Thinner than I expected and longer also but alright
3.0,"Material is not depicted accurately, I thought this material would be more dry fit material not this mesh hole material, it also runs small"
3.0,It was bigger than I anticipated. The picture on the mannequin was not properly scaled. Earrings were pretty but the quality isn't great. The part where you insert it in the ear is thick and not smooth--causing some discomfort. It was also too heavy for me.
3.0,"I am a big lover of green amethyst.  I own quite a few pieces and am always interested when I find a piece that is different than anything I already own.  This pendant is fabulous!  The stone is very pale green, very sparkly, and is free of inclusions.  In the box, I thought it was perfect.  Unfortunately, however, I was so very disappointed when I took it out of the box and discovered that the clasp is magnetic. Because of this, the pendant cannot be removed from the chain It comes on. The website didn't mention that the clasp on the chain is magnetic.  I would be fine with that except I like to wear my pendants on longer chains.  The way this necklace was made, in order to wear the pendant I am going to have to cut the chain apart, destroying it, in order to salvage the pendant.  Then I can place it on my own chain to wear the pendant at my preferred length.  If the fact that the closure is magnetic, and that both sides of the magnetic clasps are too large to allow the pendant to slide off of the chain, I never would have bought it.  So disappointed.  The stone is gorgeous, so that's why I gave it three stars."
3.0,Pretty design and good quality. The only issue I have is the tunnel is long which causes the earring to side forward and not sit flush to the ear lobe.
3.0,Kind of boxy fit. Picture is puffy... not printed onto tee.. uncomfortable.
3.0,"I was impressed with this dress. I don't expect much when I order clothing online. This is really very pretty with lightweight, soft, flowy fabric. I took the buttons and white tassel off, as they had no purpose or function and took away from the fabric pattern. I'm 5'2, 120lbs. and a small fit perfectly.<br /><br />Update 9/27/20<br />I have bought a few of these dresses in different patterns over time and have been happy. Although, with my most recent purchase I was disappointed in the new construction. The added zipper is delicate and difficult to close, I preferred the other version where you just throw it on over your head. That fabric hugged the body better. And the new adjustable straps are uneven, not symmetrical and you have to constantly adjust them. The past version had no adjustable straps and always fit perfectly. I had recently bought two, but have to return one because the top was cut so unevenly it was lopsided no matter which way you adjusted the straps."
3.0,True sizing! The top is thee cutest and fits perfect. The bottoms have no “butt seam” so it made my butt look a mile long!
3.0,"This is a nice looking outfit. My son looks very handsome in it. However, the pants and sweater are very thin and cheap feeling. The pants don't have that nice thick denim feeling at all and the sweater is ultra thin and cheap feeling - I am worried that washing it, one day it will just fall apart. The button up is just your average button up and nothing special. Of course it needs to be ironed after each wash because it wrinkled significantly.  You'd definitely want to lay the sweater flat to dry, otherwise it will not only wrinkle but I imagine it would reduce it's lifespan quite a bit.<br /><br />It was purchased as a winter outfit, but I certainly wouldn't use it as such. Perhaps for fall or early spring when the temperature is around 60 degrees.<br /><br />I wouldn't purchase this clothing set again given the chance."
3.0,"Good quality, but runs big."
3.0,My ear is too small for this.
3.0,"Fits smaller than expected, color of gray is much lighter than the photo."
3.0,"yea...a few others said the same, but its cute and hangs long...also had a difficult time trying to make it keep time, still cute though"
3.0,"I do not agree that these bracelets are comparable to Lily and Laura bracelets. Although they are a fun mix of colors and styles, the quality of the beads and workmanship on most of the bracelets was inferior to the L and L ones.  On some the design did not flow evenly around the bracelet, and on one the thread is exposed and fraying.  Some of the color combinations were downright unattractive.  You get what you pay for."
3.0,I purchased these for a birthday gift.  The socks are very nice and I hope he enjoys them.
3.0,"After wash, the waistline got  tight.  The split leg  is a bit higher  than I am comfortable  with.  Unfortunately, I am beyond  return requirements"
3.0,"The product felt snug around the package, but the straps felts rather lose."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this product, but I'm allergic to the necklace. I got the tiger eye one it's nice, but my skin didn't like it."
3.0,This fit nicely when I had a long beard. When I trimmed my beard shorter the mask couldn’t seem to stay over my nose.
3.0,"This didn’t fit me well. I have a larger bust and the style didn’t fit well and just looked odd. The mesh on the arms seemed very cheap, and it was way too short. I sent it back."
3.0,Las manecillas se mueve algo<br />Algo corriente
3.0,"Not worth $27 for this little size, of customers knew it was this small no one would buy and the seller knows this"
3.0,"I love the look of these shoes, and they are extremely comfortable, right out of the box. My only issue is that the bottom has a cloth/felt inset glued on to the rubber sole. When they get wet, you can't just wipe your feet, it stays wet and slips on hard floors. Since I bought them to be able to wear in the winter, this really disappointed me. They put the wearer at risk for fallling. It makes them unwearable on wet/snowy days. Because I liked the fit, I spent time scraping the felt off the bottom. I just wish I could get the great fit and comfort in a safer shoe."
3.0,"They are okay, but obviously look sort of not that great in quality. Not too bad overall, but should be better for the cost."
3.0,"The shipping was faster than I expected. The legging looks cute, only one thing i dont like about this legging is the material is quite cheap. Overall, it's all good."
3.0,Would have loved to order as separates. Bottom perfect but top (I'm 36c) too large. Medium would have been too small and I'm pretty equally proportioned.
3.0,"I purchased this item to replace an older model and discovered that it played a different song than the original.  Do not know why they changed the song ...I wanted it to play ""We're Loyal to You"" also known as ""Oskee Wow Wow.""  This was the most widely used and well known part of the a 3 in 1 fight song.  It is too bad that the new model plays a less popular and ""less catchy"" song."
3.0,i bought this for my daughter who is 5'6 and 125 lbs and the large fits. this runs very small as she is normally a &#34;small&#34; in women's shirts. remember it is lightweight and not a real bulky sweatshirt.
3.0,They are comfortable once you shape them.
3.0,"I love the stones, they are very unique. But I have a problem with the workmanship . The stones are glued in unevenly, blobs of glue left on the sides and around the stones. I would like to get the necklace with the stones on a side, I could doe much better job gluing in the stones, and it would save me a lot of time, aggravation and some stones would be with out damage. I was born a perfectionist, a sloppy workmanship brutalizes me. When I got the set, necklace with earnings right away I tried to remove the extra glue. the glue was very hard, and my cleanup damaged some stones."
3.0,"Cute but very short! I'm 5'7"" and the large was entirely way to short!"
3.0,Uneasy to use due to fitting material that comes with the set .
3.0,Look different in the site
3.0,The shoulder stitching cut off the shoulder board application. The garment was too small.
3.0,"I'm 5'8'' and the Large Size is still short for me. Color and Quality are good, but the skirt is not long enough, so I ended up not using it"
3.0,Great fit. The material is pilling on the inside of the thigh.
3.0,"The hat would be great if it fit. I did not realize when I ordered the only available size was small. The app accepted my order without me inputting a size. It figured since the only size available was small, then small it would be. on something as important as size the system should never auto populate the size selection. Force an order to specify a size before accepting the order. It is what happens when capturing the sale is more important than making sure it is right."
3.0,I believe it should come with a plastic piece like this one on my other watch cover
3.0,"RED SIZE 11 1) I recommend buying a whole size larger.  I usually wear a 10 or 11 depending on the style so I initially purchased size 10.5. I figured that would allow enough length at the toe. It did not. The size 11 that  I exchanged the first size for is long enough.  2) These shoes are a great color, but offer very little support, definitely not a pair for athletic activity or walking around long periods. The size 11 does allow enough room to add arch supports to offset the problem."
3.0,"I liked the shirt, but I thought it would be a little bigger. It was also thinner, more like a tshirt material. I thought it would be heavier like a regular hoodie. I like the color and the length."
3.0,I ordered one and after a few uses the zipper came off its tracks. So I fixed it will another zipper. A few days later the zipper broke. I bought another one it did the same thing the first one did.. I like the bag but zipper issue stinks.
3.0,"Loved the dress, but the fabric is to thin. Its a cute dress."
3.0,This was a nice cardigan. It fits as expected. But down fall it's not heavy at all. So I returned mines. But it looks  Exactly like the picture.
3.0,"Cute style. I will give it that. However, the bottom of this &#34;dress&#34; barely covered my rear end. I am a size 8-10 (and only 5'4&#34;) and bought a large. It fit perfectly everywhere but it is by no means a dress and does not hit mid-thigh like in the picture. I am hoping it will look cute with pants or leggings."
3.0,The shirts are cut outs. They will be nice for summer and in the gym because they are super thin. I wouldn't order again however I won't complain too much because I will use these shirts as tracers for shirts to cut on my own.
3.0,"This product is a very cheap material but the print is nice. The seam on one of the legs actually came undone so I had to re-do that. The fit is as per the size chart. I am 5’8”, 135lbs and it fit fine. Probably wouldn’t buy again but it worked for the occasion"
3.0,"Looks nice. Would've given 4 stars if it hadnt come with cat hair all over it, which Im allergic to... ew 😞 must've been a return that they didn't even look at before shipping it to the next customer. Not impressed. Cant even try it on until I wash it 🙄"
3.0,"So I ordered this for my mom for Christmas because she loves hearts and I found it just beautiful, it arrived sooner then I expected so I checked to make sure it was in good shape, But when i opened it it was this round pendant not the heart I had ordered, lucky she liked it anyway but idk if i will order another one."
3.0,I have a iPhone 8 plus. The phone fits in purse but I can’t unlock the phone through the plastic. I am so disappointed. I’m thinking about cutting a hole in the plastic so I can unlock it.
3.0,Feels thin and cheap but it’s nice that they send 2 sizes
3.0,I am 5’4 and this dress is shy of revealing everything to the world! It is very short! I saw other reviews that it was a tad short but could still be worn; mine could not be worn at all!
3.0,The shoes are so beautiful. I bought ugh this all 3 colors. But buck the buckle was so cheap it broke on 1st wear
3.0,This was larger than I expected. I got it for my grandson who is four.  It's too big for him so I gave it to my nieces friend who loves it.  I would buy another one if they had a smaller one.  My grandson was disappointed.
3.0,"We got ours in time for a Cosplay at a conference, only to notice that there is some discoloration on the right hand pocket.  It looks like a sun bleach spot , or just an area where the dye didn't take into the fabric."
3.0,"Looks nice on, loose around the stomach hiding small tummies.  However, you must iron as it comes out of the dryer very wrinkled.  Light green is a pleasant color."
3.0,"Suit is nice, but size runs small."
3.0,"i have always bought these sandals for my son, but for some reason this year they much more narrow and uncomfortable for him to wear."
3.0,"They are pretty, but not warm!<br />Touch screen fingers do work, but my hands are cold wearing these."
3.0,Great looking cleat; just fits really tight I would've sized up
3.0,Nice jacket but tight in the chest and shoulders. There is no give really.
3.0,"they looked good but, were too small for my kid even though he is not big boy"
3.0,No fue lo.que esperaba
3.0,"Too small, cheaply made, not silver!"
3.0,"Ordered Navy and Grey, but got Black and Grey"
3.0,I had ordered gold but they came in silver. I’ll still keep but was disappointed. Very lightweight and stylish.
3.0,The armholes are twice the size they should be. I will have to alter before I can wear it. I can't believe it was meant to be made this way
3.0,"These slippers are very comfortable, but I think they sent the wrong size. Although they were labeled &#34;toddler4-5&#34; on the package, they fit me and I wear a woman's size 5.5! Right now I am trying to decide if I should just keep them for myself or send them back."
3.0,Love it. Got lots of complements BUT I actually bumped my hand into a door and watch's face frame is made of cheap plastic so crack the frame and waiting for fall apart. Little sad but we get what we paid for.
3.0,Maybe if I went a size up they would be longer but I’d be afraid of them being baggy everywhere else. Length is my only issue
3.0,"It served it's purpose which was to just keep my nose piercing open while I work. It's very flimsy, and little pointy, and must remember to keep clean!!! PLEASE look at the sizing, it will seem like its fit only for an earring hole, and you may have to get something to stretch your piercing hole back to its normal size"
3.0,Good fit arrived on time and keeps my hands warm
3.0,"For the price, you would expect a perfect silicone ring, with a very nice box or packaging.  It’s not bad, but for the price you would expect a little bit more and a little bit more quality control.  The ring is good quality and fits as expected, and it definitely is a nice looking ring.  The box is nice, but I feel as if a tiny wooden box or something more Harry Potter’ish  would have been appreciated.  I’m sure branding is expensive, but this isn’t very far ahead in price compared to their regular silicone rings. Overall I would recommend if you’re on with the premium price and want a branded ring of your favorite franchise."
3.0,nothing in particular
3.0,"Love the shirt, but will be ordering about 2 or 3 sizes up from normal."
3.0,Used to keep chafe and dust out of eyes while spreading straw mulch. Worked well but padding quickly flattened out becoming uncomfortable and loosening seal. They were used in very warm conditions and exposed to much moisture (sweat) so that likely didn't help their endurance.
3.0,Big a lot
3.0,"Bought this knowing I was taking a chance, and of course had to return it. Purchased the largest size and it looked like it was made for a 10 year old. Otherwise was pretty cute. Very unfortunate for me."
3.0,"I have tapered toes, a high arch, and narrow feet; these were my first shoes. They were decent in that the support was good, and the wide platform allowed me to balance for a long time without issue. However, if your feet are like mine, you may feel constricted by the width of the shoe, since it doesn't allow for all that much movement. I suggest it for beginning students with non-tapered, slightly wide-wide feet. It's really best to go to a store and be professionally fitted. All in all, the shoes were worth the $29, but not the right kind for my feet."
3.0,It's beautiful but I'm a little too chesty so it doesn't fit my bust
3.0,"My daughter normally wears 3t. This outfit was great in length, but the waist was a little tight for her. The shirt fit perfectly so it served it's purpose for pictures."
3.0,Like graphics but quality low. Ends weren't hemmed or have a tie/tightening cord.
3.0,"i ordered this because of the color, and it's not as pictured.  it's more burgundy not red/orange."
3.0,"I love the way these earrings look in person - even better than I hoped!  However, they started to stretch my ear holes as soon as I put them in.  WAY too heavy!  Also, as I was taking them off, noticed some black spots on the hook/post portion that came off on my fingers a little, so they may be corroded.  Didn’t affect the front of the piece, but may not be good for sensitive ears."
3.0,"Quality was nice and I really liked it, but I had to return this as it was too small for me."
3.0,Overall I like this coat and don't mind that it doesn't have buttons since I go from door to car when I wear it. But not having pockets is ridiculous.
3.0,"My 4 and 6 year old boys have been wearing fans for a. Purple of years now. It's apparent that there is a new producer in China. I buy a new pair about every 6 months,  increasing foot size by 1/2. With the new producer (can tell by characteristics of shoe detail) I have had to go up 1 1/2 sizes. The old size 10 is bigger then the new size 11."
3.0,"Didn't like the texture, slips."
3.0,"I ordered two miracle suits and will probably only keep one because of the price.  In the picture, the red in the print looks like a dark red with black, but it is more of a true red color.  I would have preferred the darker red color.  The price for this brand of suit is way too expensive compared to the quality.  I purchased a suit very similar to this one from Kohl's for well under $50 and there is no difference in the quality.  The beads on the straps don't stay put, they keep moving and slipping.  I also don't think the finish on them will last long in a pool or spa.  I only gave this three stars because of the price.  It is really not worth $90.  The fit and bust support are good, but they come at a high price."
3.0,I got a water stain on it from the condensation of a drink. Tried everything stain will not come off...
3.0,"My own fault, but I expected the peas to be silver like the pod & chain.  The peas were actually white...hence the title.  My own fault.  But, in addition to that, we bought 3 for each of three sisters, &#34;3 peas in a pod&#34;.  But this is better for a younger child, not an adult.  For the price though, it's a good buy.  I don't regret anything."
3.0,Love these PJ’S but wore them 3 times and the leg seam split.
3.0,Psinful
3.0,"Bought this for my friend (he is a medium typically), it fit a bit too short on him, but decently around. The design was well done, no fading or weird colors, exactly what it looks like."
3.0,"Great color, but see-threw at the chest."
3.0,"I bought these for my husband who works in the oil field, he is outside alot in the mud and snow in Utah. In his opinion ""Your feet would freeze in these at 35 below..."""
3.0,"True to color and look, however it is very long but not wide at all... very form fitting and looks like a dress"
3.0,Jersey is not of good quality. Already fraying after first use
3.0,Se rompen fácil si no los cuidas
3.0,"The fabric is incredibly thin and looks as if it can be ripped very easily. The bottom really gives away the cheapness of the material, in the sense that it looks as if someone who was just getting into sewing decided to cut some fabric and make a skirt. I'm upset that I spent the amount of money on it that I did."
3.0,I love these they are so cute and fun.really are great for the summertime and wearing with a summer dress
3.0,"I think this charm is okay.  I wasn’t impressed but not hating it either.  The charm was smaller than I thought it would be.  Barely could see the mom on it (that is how small it is).  Did fit my bracelet, just not thrilled with it.  It looked better in the pictures."
3.0,"It is what it is, a Halloween costume kit.  The tail is rather difficult to attach and not made for everyday wear.  My child does not want to dress up as a princess she wants to be a cat.  But the delivery was exceptional, will visit seller again."
3.0,"This product came fast and I was hoping it will work great for my glasses to stop fogging up but it didn't. I was disappointed at the fact that it did not work due to this product having great reviews. Maybe it worked on different pair of glasses but unfortunately, it did not work for me."
3.0,Isnt as long as it looks.<br />Bought the large and the arm holes were huge and didnt fit properly against the body.
3.0,"The frame is too britle, broke one leg of the frame a couple of weeks after receiving them"
3.0,"The fabric is good. I only had it on for a min or two while trying it on, but I think after hours of wearing it the lace would cause some itching.... I am 5'8&#34; 150lbs with 36C and this shirt was definitely too tightly fitting for my taste. I ordered a large and it felt like a medium. I wish they offered an XL...."
3.0,The shirt is a good quality soft not rough. But the cow is very blurry.
3.0,To large around the neck material was not very good didn’t like that color green
3.0,"Its not as big as shown on the picture. Its a cute pinky ring at best. I don't know what else to say, but its ok!"
3.0,"Not as cute as expected. Thin material, shows all bumps etc."
3.0,"Nice quality, just small,  not much flex."
3.0,Thin thin material .Small more like an extra small
3.0,I have given up on bralettes. This was one of many I have tried in the past year hoping for a good fit.  This was small for the size and no support. 👎☹️
3.0,"This bracelet was really large for a small wrist. Pretty, otherwise, but a little big."
3.0,They don’t last “nice” after one wear you can see that the leggings pull easily and develop look worn and old after two washes.  However the price point is ok.  Meant to be worn only one season.
3.0,"My wife was very disappointed when I received these pants. She said they felt like cheap linen, so she held them up toward the light and you could see right through them. When she put them on they were small. She usually wears a 1X and these are 2X and snug. The bottoms flair out and just did not look good. The price is high for what you get. She loves linen and J.Jill is her go-to store for linen capris. The price is about the same but the quality is far superior with J.Jill. She said that she would not recommend the purchase of these pants."
3.0,The wife and I love keen products as well as my sons first pair of keen shoes. These seem to be of the same quality standard but they are really tough to put on our toddler. It gets really tight trying to stuff the heel into the boot. Hopefully it will get easier once broken in more.
3.0,"Dress is a weird stretch material with a huge seam going down the back of it. It does fit a little large. I am 37 weeks pregnant and ordered a small, still had extra material everywhere. Dress is floor length."
3.0,"These socks are very soft - however, the top band rolls down and doesn't stay up well.  Overall they are an okay product.  Stepping up the quality of the top band would be a great boost to the product and I wouldn't mind even paying a little more for a better quality product."
3.0,"These earrings are really nice. The wood is finished better than a lot of other wooden plugs I've purchased. However, the flare on these plugs is HUGE. Because it was much too large to get into my ears, I had to sand down the rear flare in order to wear them. The good news is that if you have really stretchy ears they probably won't fall out."
3.0,"Nice cap,  but only for large heads"
3.0,"I should have listened to other reviews. The whole top portion fits perfectly, but it is not long enough. I don't have a long torso, but I needed at least an inch or two more to snap the bottom comfortably. I thought of just tucking it into my pants or skirt, but it's a high cut for the thighs, so it just pops out awkwardly. Luckily I know how to add an extended piece of snaps to make it work, but honestly it may not even be worth the hassle. Definitely made for those with short torsos! Still cute though."
3.0,Not as pretty or good quality in person
3.0,Just what I wanted. Just wish the numbers where darker. My vision is not good.
3.0,"The pants were great, they were very stretchy and long, I wear a 14/15 in pants. They were just above the ground even with my crocs on, which was perfect because my legs are long. The top was the problem. The arms are super tight and I definitely couldn't zip it up. I wear a medium sometimes Large because I wear a 38DDD."
3.0,This hat came folded up as expected but when unfolding I was a little disappointed in the wiring that is in the brim of the hat. It doesn't seem super study for unfolding and repacking. It did it and has held up but it has only been on one short trip. I didn't fold it all the way back but just in 1/2 for repacking for the trip. The fold don't completely come out of the wire or the fabric. Also I have a bigger head and found this hat to be almost too tight. I was wanting to see if I could stretch it out but after reading reviews of it falling apart when it gets wet I didn't do it. Overall this is a great inexpensive hat when wanting to bring something that you won't be too upset about if you lose or gets ruined.
3.0,Runs a little large. Cute but the material feels a little cheap. I kept it because it still looks nice. Good for work.
3.0,"I ended up returninh these because the quality just wasnt there. Honestly wasn't sure what to expect for the price but was willing to find out. I was getting a bit itchy as well wearing these. I ended up buying directly from Apple, huge quality difference but obviously with a premium price"
3.0,"First off, people should know it’s EXTREMELY unlikely they’re getting beads made of REAL gems like moonstone for as cheap as 6.99. . In fact, I’d venture as far as to say not possible. PLZ KNOW THIS & DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GETTING DUPED INTO PURCHASING ENERGY GEMS THAT ARE ACTUALLY JUST GLASS OR SOMETHING ELSE. && I’m not saying don’t buy, for 6.99 even if not real gems, they’re still cute accessories you don’t have to be afraid to wear for fears of wear n tear. That said, KNOW WHAT YOUR BUYING PPL. These are absolutely not real moonstones despite their beauty, iridescent beauties like moonstones can be some of the easiest ones to imitate w/ other materials && real moonstone is rarely that cheap just like real moldavite is not only rarely sold at cheap prices due to its limited quantity here on earth, but also is RARELY found cheaply smoothed into beads as it’s got a natural rough cut nature & you lose a lot of the gem shaping it down. This is probably why some ppl say the stones they get are more vibrant than expected while others are showing pics of what clearly appears to be some form of glass colored beads not presenting with the proper expected color/shades of the real thing. Some of these gems are not easily found at cheap prices which probably means the ones like moonstone are fake. Even the fluorite which is much more common is probably fake… Just PLZ be aware of that when your buying, don’t expect some amazing rare gem for 6 bucks."
3.0,"Love this bra. Super comfortable. A little bigger than what I anticipated but that might be my fault for measuring myself wrong or something. But I love this bra, super comfy!"
3.0,The black is actually light gray. Very thin material. Everything shows through.
3.0,"Love the material, style and comfort of these nightshirts and glad I ordered a size up for comfort. However.... what I received is NOT what is pictured. I did receive the gray with green sleeves BUT the other night shirt was solid black.  Definitely not what was pictured. Just be aware."
3.0,The pictures of item seemed different from product.  The size of stones were much larger than I expected or wanted.
3.0,"Fit was great. Design was great. But material? I bought over 20 sleep and lingerie items from this brand and nearly all met or exceeded my expectations. This however felt like a bad Halloween costume. Cheap. Not like the other satin robes they had. Red also had a orange under hue to it. Not a very pretty or true red. I wanted to love it, but I can't. The material feel is enough for me to say no. I would try a different color but afraid this company may be cutting corners for $. Update 10/25/21.  So I noticed new color s were added so I ended up purchasing again in a different color. The dark red was much better, not only in color but also in material quality. I'm a 34d and got the medium. The top portion has lots of room so if you bustier, you'll be fine. I myself look alittle lost in it meaning it is very loose . The cinch is at the waist line. Probably would have been better if it was more under the bust then the waist. Just my opinion. I'm going to keep even though a small probably would have been better."
3.0,I had to return this top because it runs very small (like 2 sizes small). It is a nice top if you can figure out the sizing.
3.0,Bought it for whenever the occasion would arise to wear it. Hung it on the wall in the meantime. The glue holding the ribbon tie did not manage to make it 3 days of just immobile hanging. Love the mask but would recommend affixing the ribbon better before attempting a night out.
3.0,it's ok...☺
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:9a60f7d789d5b2a50d1374bca9b46de4]] If you commute and commonly face windy cold weather, Im not sure this would really do you any good, wind or even regular running will wick away all the heat as cold air blows right through the beanie. It does feel nice and warm when you are just normally walking or standing/sitting (without wind)"
3.0,Bought this forward my daughter in law.... First out of stock then it shipped and it looks nothing like the picture.
3.0,"Unfortunately, I did not expect this to be only an inch wide. Because of the fob advertising for steampunk, I was expecting something closer to 2 inches. It's a pretty necklace watch on a long chain worth four stars. I will keep it because not reading the entire page of information was my fault. However, I will drop a star for the reference to steampunk, this is certainly not steampunk or goth, it's actually girly."
3.0,"I guess it's OK (i.e., it works), but it's basically a roach clip. When I bought this item, the photo showed some gold decorative detail. The ones that came were simply plain white. They appear to have put up the correct photo now."
3.0,size all to small
3.0,Works as they should except for one of the strap clips was broken. Other than that they work as they should.
3.0,"Only cute ..,,, not sturdy enough , great for a child"
3.0,I ordered white and green. But i got white and blue.<br />I love the cut and style. But the quality is not so great. But it is still great for the price.
3.0,Very pretty but there are glue spots and one earring isn’t filled in completely. One of the posts were bent as well.
3.0,"It wasn't really obvious from the picture, but there's no button or fastener on the outer top. That's easy enough to fix, but I ordered the T2/T3 and it barely fits my 17-month-old daughter who still fits in slim 12m outfits just fine."
3.0,Good fit.  A little thin on material.  Great for beach over bathing siut
3.0,"Color, fabric, and style are all nice, but it's absolutely gigantic. Order several sizes smaller than you normally would."
3.0,"This is such a nice bathing suit, however, you need breast to fill it out.  I'm a 34C and the breast area was still big."
3.0,Unusable. I can’t use it on no one of my sunglasses.
3.0,Outfit is to small I am sending it back. But it is a lovely color.
3.0,"While the fabric is nice and soft, it's so thin you can see my underwear through it.  I'll still wear it around the house, but it's unfortunate that it's so thin.  Guess I got what I paid for."
3.0,love the top!!! bottom is a little small for ladies with hips.
3.0,Length was good but the liner kinda crushes the goods.
3.0,Rings are all on smaller side... and I have smaller fingers. Will not fit larger fingers
3.0,"The cut and shape of the dress was very flattering, but the shoulders did not fit me properly. The material did not fit around my neck well."
3.0,The fabric is very thick and heavy which is not really an issue with me but it's a bat wing style which you can't see in the picture. It also tapers at the feet so my legs can't move freely. I may consider returning this.
3.0,Very tight fitting. Not wearable for me and I'm size 11. Might use them for snowboarding or skiing but that's it.
3.0,This is a cute outfit but appears to be cheaply made (button snaps are plastic) and the outfit is HUGE!
3.0,"quality is good, though it doesn't have the traditional baby-style sowing on the neck, so baby's head stopped fitting through it before he outgrew it. if they change that on the product, i would give it 5 stars."
3.0,Colors are dull and I don't like the fabric. Definitely not a $90 shirt.
3.0,Ehh ... nothing great. Doesn't stay on my arms/shoulders very well.
3.0,Feels of low quality. Not at 11 price point. Feels like 5 $ swap meet
3.0,I love the print however the bag is bigger then what it was intended for. Although I will keep it for travel purposes.
3.0,"Somewhat tight in the waist and stomach area. The fabric is on the cheap side, not soft and flowy, and the lace is a little scratchy."
3.0,Pretty but thin cloth
3.0,"Great looking bathing suit. I have a DDD bust and the twins did not even come close to fitting in this lovely bathing suit. So, if you have a large bust as well, this probably will not fit so good. Fit perfect everywhere else, I was sad to have to return it."
3.0,"Cute. Does run small. But it has a weird mildew smell too it. I can’t get rid of it and it’s vedy strong. As soon as I opened the package, the smell hit me. If not for the smell, It would be great!"
3.0,The skirt was a good product overall.  The three stars is mainly for the sizing being a bit larger then advertised.
3.0,"These don’t actually fit my toddlers head as they are larger than expected, but eventually she will. They seem okay value for the money/quality."
3.0,"I love the color of this skirt but the waistband is way too tight for me so I'm sending it back - I'm 5'9, 168 lbs and I bought an XL for the length (based on other reviews). It grazes the floor when I have it sitting low on my hips. Its not see-thru and the slip underneath is a little shorter than the actual skirt."
3.0,The chain clasp broke the first hour I wore it.  I was able to use a pliers and repair it minus a few links.  It was long enough that it didn’t matter.  Disappointed that it broke so quickly but I really like the rest of the bracelet.
3.0,Doesn't glow in the dark as promised but it is still a pretty necklace for the price.
3.0,"Great size, nice pockets inside, but kind of a plastic-like material"
3.0,"My one piece was broken,otherwise it's okl"
3.0,Nice trinket - but overpriced.  It's a bracelet and cannot imagine wearing it as necklace. Was a gift and<br />  ' meh '
3.0,"I got this for my neighbor as a gift. The pug charm itself was bigger than I expected and I'm not sure who would want that hanging from their neck, but that's where the alternate options came in handy. We made it into a keychain and she put it on her keys. Unfortunately, within a few days, the clasp somehow opened and the dog charm got lost."
3.0,The magnet isn’t strong enough to keep band closed.  You need to make a narrow band with a stronger magnet
3.0,My daughter loves these! The glitter part is actually plastic which is easy to clean. Kind of stiff compared to other brands of the same style. Seems to run true to size.
3.0,"Well it's a very nice vest looks just like the pics just know the XXL is more like a medium, no love for the big fellas I got this for my dad now it's my brothers"
3.0,"The style/structure is as pictured, but the color for this one was off. I bought two other types and the colors matched, but for this one it was much lighter than expected. I really liked how it was pictured, but in-person, it’s wayyy off."
3.0,Seemed kind of cheaply made.
3.0,"this is a nice walking shoe, for the price, I wanted a shoe just to kick around in for the summer, easy on and off, and not worry if they get dirty or wet, lite canvas, plenty of cushion for me, But, I do have one issue, ordered the wrong size and returned the first pair, the seller said they have refunded my account, but as of 6/ 26, no refund showing in my account, I 'll have to wait and see if they will before I call amazon. I'm not the only one with a refund issue but the circumstance could be COVID related, I'll wait to see."
3.0,I like the bag but I don't like the top where it zips. The zipper puckers up. I am going to keep it. Will not be purchasing another bag.
3.0,"These are pretty good but they run very small. I usually order a medium and decided to get large, but should’ve bought an xl."
3.0,It is nice and I still use it but the button fell off the first time I used it and the stitching started coming out immediately too.
3.0,"I liked that this squeezes me in.  I hated that it didn't like flat.  As soon as I zipped it up, it literally rolled up my body.  I kept pulling it down.  I tried to tuck it in my high waisted leggings but it REFUSED to stay down.  It would have been perfect if it would have just laid flat."
3.0,"not the color blue, that I was expecting....more of a purple/blue. still a pretty dress."
3.0,Its an ok fit. It seems to push all my fat pieces to the top however
3.0,"Fit good, but they have a brown tint that makes the world a little ugly."
3.0,I really love these with all of the colors and the choice of metal or rubber backings (comes with both) but one pair so far has lost crystals after one wear. I answer the phone a lot with my job.
3.0,"Pretty adorable, but you will probably want to have your girl wear a shirt under this. The front is pretty revealing. The cat face is cut out over black lace background."
3.0,"These fit incredibly tight and the color is much brighter than I expected. It is especially tight around the waist and can be really awkward if you have any amount of body fat what-so-ever. Would recommend going a size up for sure, but ultimately I really like how bright and vibrant the colour is, so I'm going to wear it anyway. I will just look like a bright wet bird whose feathers are stuck to its body."
3.0,It fits like a dress
3.0,Shoes are good but the laces have to be tied. Must sell multiple products through this bc some reviews said they were slip on
3.0,"I love the color, great quality but I am disappointed with how big this band runs. I'm on the last notch and I can barely feel my watch vibrate it's so loose."
3.0,I purchased the same size that I buy in my other coats.  This ran a bit small.  It was good quality it just was too snug.  I'd definitely size up.  I agree with the other reviews that for how good the quality is - the belt looks very cheap.
3.0,"Top notch quality. Colors are different in person, looks cheap!"
3.0,"Too baggy around the butt and upper thighs. The pictures don't really show it, but that creasing on the back combined with the very thick back pocket fabric give the pants an almost comical &#34;bubble butt&#34; look. Was going to wear these to yoga, but they're just too goofy looking on me to wear anywhere but the house. They are comfortable though"
3.0,The material is not as forgiving as I would have liked. I have not tested them in the rainy season yet. They seem fine enough to wear.
3.0,"I ordered in 3X, even though the waist range is larger than my actual waist.  I figured... it's a tie wraparound, and you definitely could've made this work.  The colors are as pictured, and are great and brilliant.  But literally: this is a large swath of fabric with two ties (one on each end), so honestly nothing special.  For what I was buying it for, the fit and a little more muted coloring of my other option was a better fit, but if you're looking for nice vibrant tie dye with a wraparound/flexible fit, then this would be a solid option."
3.0,"These are all right, they definitely fit and are comfortable. However after 3-4 wears and washes they have already started to pill up. They look very worn and I haven't worn them that many times, especially now that the weather is warmer. But for five bucks a pair I guess I can't really complain too much."
3.0,Re-Ordered X-Large (I wear a medium...) Gave the medium to my 11 yr old son...
3.0,"1) The design is cute, but you definitely need to order a size up if you plan on getting this shirt! I purchased this a size too big hoping for an oversized top, but it ended up fitting like a normal long sleeved shirt.<br />2) There was a piece of super thin paper over the design when this was delivered to me too, which could definitely be a pain to remove since it breaks so easily. I highly recommend having a lint roller on hand! It made getting the residue off way easier.<br />3) The material is super itchy, but I’m hoping that decreases after a wash or two. And the slits are somewhat awkwardly placed, so I might end up just cutting the neck into something wider, lol."
3.0,Cheap looking but kind of cute for fun. Arrived quickly.
3.0,"I like it a lot, but the top is flimsy and feels like it will break easily.  I bought it to wear everyday, but I don't believe I will be able to."
3.0,Navy looks like black
3.0,"The fabric for the white and stripes dress is very light, must take this into consideration when choosing your undergarments. It’s a comfortable dress. The item I received seems to have been a returned item. When I received it, it came unbuttoned, the straps were adjusted awkwardly, it was wrinkled, and some of holes for the buttons were too wide as if the person had trouble getting the garment on and off, and it didn’t have any tags. It came in a ziplock style bag. Aside from having to fix the buttons it’s a cute dress. Good for this 90 degree weather."
3.0,"Nice socks, not as soft as the first ones I bought a couple of years ago. Kinda tight on my ankles."
3.0,"My daughter is in the 50-60% growth range, athletic, and pretty average build overall (not skinny or chubby). When she tried on these shorts (size 10), she was swimming in them. I then had an adult 120lb woman try them on, and they fit!! Something isn't right."
3.0,"True,  bright red color.  Great for supporting your favorite red sports team.<br /> The sleeves seems slightly shorter than normal.  I also wish the sleeves were more narrow or had elastic at the wrist to make it look a little less frumpy."
3.0,"This was super cute, but the moon fell off of it not too long after I bought it. I'm not too upset because I was able to just replace it with another pendant"
3.0,"I've been wearing Russell Fleece for a number of years and have always been very pleased; However, the past two sweatshirts<br />I have purchased seemed to have the same problem.  After one, maybe two washes, the elasticity in the bottom of the sweatshirt<br />ceases to exist.  My older Russell sweatshirts still have elasticity in the cuffs and waistband after many, many washes.  Not sure<br />why the quality has gone down.  I will be very careful  about buying another one in the future."
3.0,"They were very cute and the length I was looking for, but the chain hurt my ears going in and out so I returned them."
3.0,"They’re cute, but wayy to long of a post. It is sticking out ridiculously and it keeps twisting around in my ear, will be returning"
3.0,Its etching
3.0,"Fit well. Turns out, I'm allergic to the silicone strip that's on the heel."
3.0,There is no elastic band on the hat! There are tie strings on it to get the size. It is very difficult  to tie and it's either too tight or too loose!
3.0,"This is pretty, but it's not for everybody shape. I have a long torso and short legs and am a curvy size 12--36D-31 waist-41 hips. I'm barely 5'3 and weigh about 165lbs. I have some wounds on my legs so I thought this would be nice to wear but still sorta cover them up. The waistline just couldn't decide if it wanted to be an empire waist or a true waist for me--like I said, I have a long torso. I tried it on with various belts and such, but either it was going to be all pulled up uncomfortablely in the booty and too much cleavage, look too hippy or preggers, , or just blah. I can see this working on other people, as I did in the reviews. The blue color I ordered was very beautiful though, I did return it."
3.0,"This top will fall forward if you’re practicing yoga and go into downward facing dog! I loved the look and color, but I had to tie a knot to keep it from sliding off of my back!"
3.0,The magnet is so strong that it makes it very hard to open and get your cards out of it.
3.0,"Although the Material is soft and fleece-lined, I found it already showed some threads after washing it once. It also does not stretch, do it’s hard to pull Hoodie over your head and face. Other than that, it was a nice sweater."
3.0,"It's a very nice item, seems well constructed and sturdy. But... who had the idea of putting a white zipper? The item obviously is not whashable, so that part that receives constant manipulation will show marks of wearing inevitably! Regretfully I didn't notice that in the pictures, in my case I bought the one with the design of red flamingos and green leaves, it has only one picture in the listing and the white zipper is hardly seen. That being said, I must highlight Amazon Customer Service response and solution to my claim to return the item, very understanding and professional."
3.0,"The post of the nose ring is too long for my nose. Shipped fast and secure- came in a large package for a small item. Well priced, just does not work for me."
3.0,"Definitely a cute pair of pants as far as the pattern goes although there are some design aspects I’m not crazy about.<br /><br />1. Back pockets are fake.<br />2. Button and zipper are really cheap. Zipper is the kind that is hard to get up and down by that I mean it’s not a “smooth” zip.<br />3. Weird seams on the back, see photo.<br />4. These run HUGE. I read the reviews and chanced buying a size small and it fits. I’m typically a Medium/Large I wear a size 6 jean but usually need more stretch in the booty area. ***But I think since these are men’s that’s the size discrepancy for women reviewing.***<br /><br />Overall I’m satisfied, hoping the button and zipper will hold up since I love the pattern."
3.0,The dress looks pretty but the waist line is too high. I am 5'2&#34; and am very petite. I ordered a small and the waistline is still high. Also the matetial is very stiff and scratchy
3.0,Returning — too karge
3.0,Cute dress but some of the stitching was poor and it had a stain on it.
3.0,Not as puffy as a down jacket and didn't expect the continuous loop. Made it hard to get close to neck for warmth.
3.0,Huge earings and pearl broke right when I opened it. I glued it back on and its fine but didn't know they were this big. But for the price you cant complain too much.
3.0,"Liked the had ,braclet came apart first day,earrings are cute but too big"
3.0,"We ordered both blue and leopard and both are adorable.  The blue dress arrived first and it was very roomy but not so big that it looked bad.  The leopard arrived today in the same size (10-12), same style, same seller and its at least 2 inches wider across the waist when laying flat as you can see in the picture.  I have a smaller size coming and hopefully it's more like the 10-12 in the blue.  Nice quality fabric and adorable modest style."
3.0,They're nice and all....just a little big and bulky. Definitely only wanna use it for costume purposes. I wouldn't wear it for the actual jewelry because it's a bit tacky.
3.0,The dress is really pretty. Not thrilled about it being polyester but still nice on. It was too big so I had to have it altered
3.0,"Didn't care for this. It's ok, but nothing special"
3.0,i ordered a size bigger as some reviewers advised and what i received is actually a size too big. but its very comfy. just wish i could shrink it a bit!
3.0,"The black band was exactly as pictured. The blue band was black on one side and blue on the other... which looked very tacky, and made it unappealing."
3.0,Way way way way way too big. Bought a size 12 of which my niece is in at the moment and went by measurements. She has a long body and this is way too big. So disappointed as the class already started and now we must buy in town.
3.0,"Order 2-3 sizes up, I ordered 1 size up to my regular size and it was way to small…"
3.0,"Super cute outfits! I bought both the 0-3 month boy & 18-24 month girl. The 0-3 month onsie and hat fit great & the pants were just a little large (1 month old about 10 lbs). The girls skirt was way too long. The pictures make it seem as if the skirt might be knee length, but it was to my daughters ankles (16 months old, 22 lbs and about 30 in tall)."
3.0,Looks cuter on the model
3.0,The mask is a bit tight and itchy. The cape is a tie closure which pulls on your neck unless you pull the cape forward around shoulders. It will work for a night but not going to be very comfortable.
3.0,I thought it would look better.
3.0,"Love the bracelet, but it is to big for my wrist"
3.0,I’ve been ordering David archly for years now. It seems they changed the sizing because these fit larger than I’m used too. Wish I would’ve ordered a size smaller.
3.0,too short..not for tall girls. Going to need to wear with leggings or tights
3.0,These run small and it is recommended that they be hand washed and hang to dry.<br />Get what you pay for.
3.0,"It looks nice, but is a bit heavy and not a great strength band. So the ring will slide and flip and didn't stay on my finger well. But with a little hot glue it helped a lot"
3.0,"Everything is nice and has a pretty color. The sleeves are not sewn correctly. They should be set back farther because if you move your arms back it pulls the fabric so your arms cant reach back. The arm seam can't be fixed because to save fabric they cut the front piece too narrow. Because I can sew, I will take off the arms, add fabric to the front and set the sleeves where they belong."
3.0,I agree with what most other reviewer‘s wrote.  The instructions are a little lacking and the product is a little disappointed if you’re expecting to use it as a permanent solution.  To attach a button temporarily in a pinch it works well
3.0,"These gloves are OK, I got an XL and while I dont feel like I have XL hands they were a perfect fit.  The deerskin palm is nice, I prefer it to leather, but would have been nice on the whole glove and not just the palm.  The real downside to the gloves, which I found pretty deceiving from the pictures and description, is that only the right hand has the touch screen compatibility, and it’s only on the index finger and thumb.  The left hand is just a normal glove.  So if you’re left handed or want to use your phone/tablet with your left hand I would look at another pair.  I’m going to keep them because it’s a hassle to return stuff but I do feel tricked since only one glove is touch compatible and it only says “right glove” in regards to the touch compatibility in one place in the description while the pictures and test of the description actually leads you to believe both gloves are touch compatible."
3.0,I actually love these tank tops.A little dissappointed that they are actually made out of a different material than expected.
3.0,"Cute top, but runs small and shrinks a lot"
3.0,If you are wanting a very very loose fitting shirt then this is for you. Otherwise keep scrolling.
3.0,I did not realize the face was so big. You have to have a large arm.
3.0,Its not real leather like stated
3.0,"Giving three stars because these shoes were so narrow my son couldn't get his feet in them. Took them to have them stretched, but they couldn't stretch them enough. Was a waste... :/"
3.0,We loved the product functioned how it should and we're comfortable. The only reason I'm not giving it 5stars is when we received the package the 2mm tunnels were missing. They are a crucial part in the process of gauging your ears.
3.0,It's cute but I'm glad I didn't pay much for it. Already came apart.
3.0,I’m 5’2 and it’s super cute but the pants are way too long.
3.0,The watch is pretty but was too small - I had to return it
3.0,"Nice product if you’re taller. Really not sized for us short girls. Everyone at the hospital wears them, they love the support."
3.0,Stretches permanently and the top part would be better for someone with larger breasts;)
3.0,It was very pretty but it broke after I wore once :(
3.0,way too big for a 6g was more like a 4 or 2. get the sizes correct please.
3.0,Unfortunately I had to returned the item. It was too large!
3.0,"Basic and fine, have been holding up well."
3.0,Smaller than expected but was as pretty as expected
3.0,Its cute. Good quality but the color is a bit off. Doesnt look like denim so much. More like denim material and navy color. The picture has some lighter spots but it is all one color
3.0,The lace footies fit snug with minimal room for my toes to move. They are lovely otherwise. A person with size 7 and larger will be uncomfortable in these footies. Buyer beware.
3.0,"Product appears to be well made. Quality is good as a replacement. Physically this lens is thinner than the oem Oakley lens that came with the sunglasses, outside diameter is perfect but since it's thinner than oem there's a noticeable forward-backward play when you're cleaning the lens (but don't worry lens wont fall off since outside diameter is a perfect fit on the frame).  Now the turn off about the lens, unlike oem oakley lens, this lens significantly affect how you see color-- things seems to look orangish (if there's such a word). But if you're using this lens on really bright sunny day, I think it's forgivable."
3.0,"This hat is super cute.  However when my daughter opened it on Christmas day which I had left in packaging it was sent in from the seller.  The clip that clips into your hair was broken, and the chains were a tangled mess.  I untangled all the chains, and thank the Lord we owned a hot glue gun to fix the clip that was broken upon recieving.  Oh and if you don't know tghis because I do didn't this is not a full size hat it's a hair asscessorie hat that clips into your hair."
3.0,"I bought this to wear to a fall wedding.<br /><br />For the price, the fabric and sticking were not bad, but the fit was very weird. The shoulders were too wide and the armpit area looked like I was wearing a wing suit. I could have probably sized down, but I don't think that would have changed whether or not I wanted to wear it to my intended event.<br /><br />The sleeves looked really sloppy. It was like the sleeves on a regular old long sleeve shirt on an otherwise nicely made dress. I think this dress probably would have looked okay with a capped sleeve or as a sleeveless dress.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that it is quite long. I am 5'9"" and the bottom hem of the skirt hit me at mid-calf. Shorter folks will either need to want an ankle-length dress, or be willing to get it hemmed.<br /><br />I returned it."
3.0,"Well made, however it doesn't fit me. The size wasn't clear on amazon because USA sizes aren't provided.  I ordered what I thought would fit based on cup size.  The cup is too small and the width is too large."
3.0,Ran a litter smaller than expected. Good material though
3.0,I liked the hat and thought it was cute but I only got one wear out of it before the ball on the top fell off.
3.0,Not bad for the price. They are hard to open and close. Feels like they will snap
3.0,"Great quality, and the medium fits great in the waist and thighs (comfy and loose).<br />The problem is they're way too short for me. I'm 6'2&#34; so that's not unusual for me when buying pants that don't have a variable length.<br />The picture shows some slack around the cuff, mine fit totally tight and too short around my ankles and calves."
3.0,i ordered this thinking that it would be much smaller than it is. the quality on the inside is pretty cheap and is kind of falling off on the side. not sure if i’d recommend
3.0,The tint wasn't as dark as I had wanted. But they're still a nice pair of shades.
3.0,Ok but magnet not strong enough won't stay tight of wrist.
3.0,"Comfortable and flattering. I had plenty of room, it wasn't skin tight. BUT the 1st time I wore it, I bent over and it split at the seam by the zipper in back...sun's out, buns out :( Had it not done that, I'd give it a 5 all around."
3.0,not a comfortable fabric but pretty
3.0,I ordered too large of stone my bad.
3.0,"Bought 2 of these shirts from the same brand, the other I love but this one fits tighter. I ended up giving it away."
3.0,Came on time...but the lanyard looks nothing like the picture...when t arrived i was confused...not the same material nor is it double sided as depicted...but i needed to get rid of the boyfriend's old lanyard so this will have to do...gave 3 starts cause its misleading...two different pictures are advertised for the lanyard
3.0,I love the color and the fit. However. the back plunges to the waist making it impossible to wear a bra with this garment. I am going to look for some stretchy lace to fill part of that gap.
3.0,"This is an odd combination of a comfortable batwing top but made of a thin waffle weave that, thankfully, I got in black so it isn’t see through!<br />So it’s thin but a turtleneck & it’s flowy but the sleeves are snug. I guess it’s for cool summer evenings or for colder weather with a cami underneath? Not super thrilled with it, but it will come in handy for an extra dark top & the price is reasonable.<br />Definitely size down - I got the Medium & it’s plenty big (for reference, I’m 5’8”, 140 lbs, 36B).<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope that it’s Helpful!)"
3.0,I had to return it but I am going to try and order another one from this brand. Though the mask was soooo pretty my eyes aren't wide enough apart so it poked my eyes in the corners. Maybe a different shape would work better for me?
3.0,"I bought this as a maternity dress but found it to be very shapeless and not so flattering on me. (When my 2 year old saw it she said, “mommy has pajamas!”) Also, the material is pretty thin and looks and feels like it will pill easily - it was already looking a little fuzzy right out of the package. The laundering instructions say to hand wash or dry clean which might possibly prevent further pulling, but that’s a lot of maintenance for a casual dress if this quality.<br />It might work for someone who doesn’t care so much about the material (I’m picky with textures) and whose body type is more suited to loose dresses - it is a really pretty color (I got the dark purple) and the lace is gorgeous too....wished it worked on me but I will be returning."
3.0,It is functional but it isn't as soft or pliable as the OEM band that came on the watch.  The clasp also scratches very easily.  The attached photo is only after 2 weeks us use.
3.0,"not to knock the brand. but they are not as nice as advertised. they are bigger than i thought and they feel like they were built in a rush. listen...everyone knows i am a big fan of sunglasses, ask my wife. but here is the deal; they aren't good."
3.0,"My only complaint is that these colors are not nearly as vibrant and cheery as pictured. It’s not awful, but I have a feeling my daughter is going to be jealous of her sister’s set (same brand-different pattern/color scheme) that was as brightly colored as pictured."
3.0,"Band fits well and is very comfortable, the pin holding it to the watch body broke in mine though and I haven't been able to find contact info for the seller for replacement pins."
3.0,"I have floaters in my eyes that causes a lot of glare and hopped this would help, I do not see any difference. For the price you may still want to try them, they may work for you."
3.0,"I only wear bioflex jewelry and this one was really comfortable and cute, BUT the top ball cracked and broke off after two hours of wear, under normal conditions."
3.0,So these are nice shoes they look just like the picture but they are kinda cheap they are more for in the house then outside they stretch out over time but my daughter loved them
3.0,"Overall the bathing suit fits expectations as being what I was looking for in a &#34;mermaid bathing suit&#34;. The top part fits a little baggie, so I had to safety pin it to fit my chest area."
3.0,too small but otherwise fine. should have expected something from the oriental lands to be designed for tiny people.
3.0,Elastic at top is binding
3.0,"color MUCH different than pictured. would call color blush, NOT pink. cute otherwise"
3.0,It's super cute but the earrings didn't come with a back... To lock the earring in place...
3.0,"This sweatshirt was not very well received.  Our daughter likes baggy sweaters and sweatshirts and the overall fit I think is perfect, but the graphics were not appreciated.  It is wonderfully long which is warm during the eternal Minnesota Winter. The fabric is thick and seems OK, in fact, I think if we could remove the graphic it would be a favorite.<br /><br />Unfortunately the zipper does not seem to be great.  It zips up far better than it zips down and she had to resort to pulling it over her head and it took some wrestling to get it unzipped again.  I wish the nice cut was matched with a nice zipper and graphic."
3.0,"I ordered one without lace, and it fit perfectly.  This one with the lace was a bit smaller and less flattering.  The fabric is thicker."
3.0,The googles are easy to put on and take off with the quick release.  The anti-fog does not seem to do a100% job when swimming in an indoor pool.  There great for swimming outside and blocking the sunrays.  I would recommend them to other swimmers.
3.0,"I was excited to get these linen pants until I received them. I cannot wear them. If you purchase them, I would order at least one size up- in my case, I would have to order two sizes up.<br /><br />The drawstring waist works fine but the linen is very thin.  Not all linens are created equally and this is no exception. This is a low quality of linen and you can see through it- totally.<br /><br />I order from J.Jill usually and their linen is quality, this is not."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this shirt.. however it doesn't fit well and any lint, hair ,etc sticks to the fabric.  It comes out of the wash looking like I used it as a dust rag."
3.0,Runs a little small and the head piece was small
3.0,Cute but really flimsy. Be as too easy and it doesn't stand up straight very well. It's cute for my daughter in dress up as all might but this is not good quality. The stitching was coming apart before we even opened the package.
3.0,"I ordered this in my normal size, large. I had already ordered another Allegra K top in large so thought the fit would be the same. It fit very tight in the chest area. I didn't order the next size up so I am not sure if that would be large enough. I may order the XL when & if it becomes available for AMAZON PRIME shipping."
3.0,"It's a pretty dress and the fabric is stretchy but nice considering the price.  I bought 2 sizes (both larger than my true size) and neither fit correctly.  The one-size up dress was to tight in the hip area (I'm curvy) but fit well enough around my shoulders.  The dress that was 2 sizes up fit a little big in the hip area and way to big in the shoulder area.  Also, there are pleather inserts right below the shoulder and a side zipper.  Neither of which I liked but I could have ignored the side zipper as it's a stretchy dress.  Disappointed...I returned both."
3.0,"A bit loose dress and the sleeve opening is somewhat low, so the style may not have favored my figure. The quality of the fabric is really nice though, very formal and a bit heated so would be nice with a pair of leggings and low boots. The length is perfect as well, just right up the knees"
3.0,"Of the set I got, 35/40 worked. That's a pretty good ratio considering how overwhelmingly low-priced these are. I would definitely buy them again."
3.0,Nice but too expensive.  I found a similar pair for a fraction of the cost.
3.0,"SO CUTE! I was so excited when I got it. Couldn't wait to wear it! THEN I tried it on. It runs VERY SMALL! I wear a size 6 in jeans and everything else. I ordered a Medium and it was a terrible fit. Especially through the bust and hips. I will see if my friend who is smaller in the bust than me can wear it, if not I will return it. I plan to order another in a Large. Not even sure if that will fit. WHO SIZES THESE THINGS ANYWAYS!?<br />Is size 6 really a LARGE OR EXTRA LARGE???? ARGGHHHHH"
3.0,I love the shape of these glasses. they are a nice cat eye shape. They are big though. They DO NOT fall off like other people say but they are a little bit cheaply made. I am keeping them to have the lenses made prescription and put onto my old frames which are better quality.
3.0,"While the color is pretty and the quality is decent, the round neckline did not flatter me.  As a large-breasted woman, this cut emphasized my large chest.  A v-neck cut elongates my neck and chest, making me look slimmer.  This neckline was very high and made me look like Pamela Anderson -- not exactly the look I am going for.  If you're small-chested, this neckline is probably a good choice, since it will emphasize your chest, but for busty women, I would skip this top or any other top with such a high neckline.  Instead, opt for this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T5K70FO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1"
3.0,The length is to short and the cross cross part dips really low. Too low as it shows way more than even a risky person is willing to show.  The material is polyester like so not cotton/T-shirt material as I expected. I’m 5’3 140 lbs
3.0,"My review of this dress is to be taken with a grain of salt in that I used to be VERY fit and over the years and some surgeries later, non-cosmetic, the mid-drift has changed:) I am 5'3&#34; and the dress definitely can be worn without a bottom however, since my upper thighs are a bit thick, when you bend over...Hello World! If I were as small as the model, who is really?? Then I would say, go ahead and wear it without anything underneath.....I would say that if pieced together with something fitted or a pair of shorts, you are good to go. I will be traveling so, the tropics suits this style even with over a bathing suit. Also, the upper portion of the dress is oddly made as it tends to pull a bit when you move your arms up and out however, and again, it is such a pretty piece of clothing that this too could be over-looked - after all, most clothing pieces today are tailored a bit differently then a couple of decades ago....wear it and enjoy it!!"
3.0,"Too large, but easily fixable with a sewing machine. The colors are great though and it is well made"
3.0,"Too small, arms fit great, pullover too tight and chest area stomach too tight. Doesn't stretch @ all."
3.0,Ok if they are used to go from the house the car.<br />They are not meant to be used for work. My gloves got wet as soon as they touched snow or water.<br />So good gloves just not work gloves
3.0,The material is thin and it took me 40 mins to do the laces. It would've been five stars but when I put it on it's great the only problem is the elastic at the top is super tight like it's  a small .
3.0,"It was ok.  Cheap looking but held all my stuff... passport, cards, euros"
3.0,Very big .. but beautiful
3.0,"The first time I wore this bag out, the strap on it broke where it connected to the bag. I was able to quickly fix it by clipping the strap to the zipper of the bag, but I wish that hadn't been necessary. Despite this, it looks super cute and is great for when you want to go out and be hands-free with your purse."
3.0,The bands are extremely small. I can’t even wear them. I don’t have large wrists. These are obviously made with a tiny wrist in mind.
3.0,Super cute but had to put a clear coat on them to keep them from tarnishing.
3.0,"I ordered the red, size medium which fits my 9 month prego belly wonderfully and is very comfortable. However, the material is very thin which is great for summer, except that it’s pretty see through and you can also see every dimple in my ass! I’m so prego I don’t care though and the comfort and air flow is worth it for AZ summer."
3.0,a bit flimsy but good for a super casual feel/look
3.0,The construction doesn't help the problem as much as it should but helps a little.  It was satisfactory.
3.0,"I don't think they are too big for a women to wear. I have bigger cz's so the second zee is not my problem. In fact, I think the size is the best part about these earring..PERFECT!!<br />The steel/antiquing is what I don't care for. Mine look like a rough casting and not a finished product. Very dull, dingy looking even for antiqued metal."
3.0,Cute dress but tighter and shorter than expected. The color was also a lighter brighter pink than in the photos. Sending back.
3.0,It is form fitting and is hand wash only
3.0,"I would’ve rather not worn this under my dress. It kind of made my stomach look flatter, but it pushed the excess fat up and made it look like I had rolls on the side of my boobs. I had to continuously pull the shapewear up to make everything look presentable."
3.0,"Somewhat bashed and worn on delivery, brown shoe polish lost its moisture far before it should have (couple of months). Otherwise a good product."
3.0,Returned never worn
3.0,"They fit well and look good  but are NOT very dark.  Which is why I wanted them.  So they're a good backup pair, but my search for darker glasses goes on."
3.0,"Looks different from the photos, strange fabric"
3.0,Here's the thing: I believe it's possible I received what I ordered ? I don't know as it was a gift and all I saw was a picture of the recipient wearing it and after enlarging the picture fully I was still unable to distinguish  the butterflies on the bracelet . Also I bought the jewelry under the impression it was a necklace ! it's possible the description gave the length I don't know but; you tell me : hold your hands 22MM apart or whatever --- do you know what 22MM looks like ? Maybe it was even inches never the less it did NOT SAY bracelet nor necklace did it ?
3.0,I bought these to go under my vest at work and to pull down to cover my bottom (men's shirts are longer) and it doesn't cover all the way. Light weight though.
3.0,"My child is average sized and has a petite frame. She wears these for school only. She has gym every other day and wears these only on days she doesn't have gym. After about 15 wears, they shoes are totally shot. Totally unwearable. I noticed she was walking funny and inspected the shoe to discover the entire midsole was collapsed and lacking any type of support. I pulled the insole back (it's glued down but can be pulled back) to find that the inner sole is cheap grid shaped rubber which had totally broken down leaving the shoe unwearable. I had reasonable expectations given that the price was very reasonable but a child should get more than 15 easy, indoor wears before the shoe deteriorates to garbage.<br /><br />Edit: the seller contacted me and offered a replacement. My daughter likes the look so I'm changing review from 1 to 3 stars for customer service and visual alleal. If the replacement is reasonably durable than I'll change to 5 stars."
3.0,"Overall, I like this dress. I was expecting it to be ankle length. However, I did see other reviewers who had ordered multiple colors mention that the length and sizing varied a lot from item to item. I figured I'd take the gamble. Unfortunately, I ended up with one of the shorter dresses. I'm 5'5 and wear a size 14. I ordered an XL. The dress fits nicely, but falls about 3 inches shorter at the hem that I would have expected based on the picture. I'm keeping it anyway."
3.0,"I picked the size based off my measurements, so I'm assuming that it is just cut small. Overall, it was a good experience."
3.0,"They are cute but hard as a rock.  Good thing they're just for pedicures , if I got them to wear daily I would send them back"
3.0,"I ordered the black tank, the color is more of a grey instead and I’m not pleased with that. I did read other reviews and ordered a medium instead of a large and it fit well. The quality isn’t great, but overall I still liked the shirt alright."
3.0,They do not stay on my head they constantly slip off.  Other than that they’re very nice
3.0,Very cute but not quite long enough to be a dress.  The cowl/hood  has a seam under that is really tight and hard to wear off the shoulder.  Comfortable and soft material though
3.0,Great Fabric but it's a bite big and I don't really like the sides that was left unstitch.
3.0,Es muy pequeña para adolescentes de 13 años. Parece mas adecuada para niñas mas pequeñas.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:eb88f932050b44e9875165ccdef67a61]] This looks like sitcom/ low budget movie club attire. It’s not terrible, just not for everyday wear because of the material. The material is similar to a cheap thin swimsuit. Even with the material type this can definitely be dressed up as a sexy classy club dress and not look tacky so I don’t want to give it one star. For a decent quality and looking and very inexpensive dress for sexy night out it would be 5 star, especially because it’s under $10, and isn’t too thin or thick for something like that.This goes for any size. I’m short so I pulled the dress up some and wrapped the strings around me a couple of times and it was kinda cute, very workable. I might keep one of the wild prints. The blue flowers has gotta go, no way that one is going to work. I ordered every pattern and color."
3.0,"It's ok. Theres just nothing super special about it. It's as described, seems true to size, the color is cute, and is made ok."
3.0,Sent it back looked nothing like the picture. They were higher in the inseam and not long like I wanted them.
3.0,It's a nice bag but it is really small. Seems well made though.
3.0,This item is very small looks like for women.
3.0,this product is cute and fits most sizes but the silver coloration fades out rather quickly. the price is great but needs to be made out of a better metal.
3.0,"cheap, skimpy"
3.0,The sweatshirt looks nice but fits small. The price is right and husband likes it.
3.0,"Dress was heavier than expected, nice material fit wasnt right but might be my body type, not flattering. But dress seems good quality"
3.0,"Okay for a one time use, but looks kind of cheap. Not too bad for the price I suppose."
3.0,Its fine. Ya get what ya pay for
3.0,Really nice bag but has a strong petrol smell that won't leave it. Even after it being aired for several weeks now.
3.0,"Too big, but pretty"
3.0,"The feel of the material is awesome but the sizing is way off.  The sellers chart indicates a 3XL is equivalent to a US XL, but it is probably more like a slim for US L."
3.0,I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE MORE GREEN/ THESE ARE AS BLUE AS THE SKY
3.0,Nice to wear occasionally. Looks very nice😁
3.0,Don't get why it's no longer available.  Works pretty well
3.0,"The dress is sheer and the material reminds me of pajamas, for some reason I was expecting a thicker material. I was planning to wear this with a  longer utility jacket so I am going to keep it but I will not be able to wear this on its own. I guess for the price you cannot expect too much."
3.0,Looked exactly like the picture.<br />Just I choose her size a bit large.<br />I'm good with it.
3.0,"Extremely stretchy I could've sized down. I thought it had a hood on it, little disappointed it did not but still super comfy and cute!"
3.0,"These are cute, but the cactus falls off easily. I could probably tighten with pliers, but there are more to go around."
3.0,Broke on it’s own after three days of wearing it. Super cute but wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,I liked the belt until I accidently dripped it on the floor and the buckle seemed to come apart sending pins all over the place.  I figured out how to put it back together ;but I lost one small pin. Presently; I am using a paper clip to replace the missing pin. It works but!!! I wonder if they sell replacement pins?
3.0,Hoodie is thin and color is not pink as it is pictured in the picture. It is a salmon color.
3.0,"It seems a little small and it's not great quality, but for what I paid for it, it's on target"
3.0,"This dress is incredibly soft, lightly stretchy, and breezy with a loose fit and sonewhat open back. I ordered a size up to ensure a relaxed fit, but i could have been happy with my regular size. Be advised that there are pockets in this dress, and they may affect the shape of the dress, causing the hip section to bulge a little."
3.0,"This apron is not “canvas”. It is plastic, which could be a fire hazard in a kitchen. I gave it 3stars for the design. I’ll be using it in my craft room, where there is little chance of being exposed to open flame, and keep searching for a 100% cotton,medium-weight canvas apron for my kitchen."
3.0,Fits as expected but the item was poorly stitched and does not look professionally done.
3.0,My grandson only got to wear it once.
3.0,"These pajamas do the job, the price was low, but you get what you pay for!  The material is thin and not durable.  If you look close, there is some see through on the pants.  We had to return our first package because there was a hole in one of the pants.  After washing, the graphic on the shirt curls and doesn't want to lay flat.  Overall, I'm happy with them, because my 10 year old is growing so fast, these will probably be outgrown in a few months anyway.  He likes the designs."
3.0,Sleeves were too short for me.  The rest fits well.  I do like the color and it's light to pack.
3.0,Very cute top but a little too small.  Order a size or two larger and do not put in dryer!
3.0,The fabric not great. The looks not what the add
3.0,"It is a little less material in the skirt part of dress, I think I will wear it though, and the material will be great early spring or early fall"
3.0,Did not like the material and fit.the
3.0,They were very tight. Good for those that have room but very tight on the cubby cheek ones
3.0,Don't get me wrong I like the way it looks and if I over the smaller guy I think that it would look great but I'm a little bit bigger and taller so it didn't work out so good for me order the next size up if you're going to get one
3.0,"I'm 5'3, 155 lbs, 36"" bust, 32"" waist and 42"" hips. Im normally a size L but I ordered a M after reading the reviews. The dress was way too long and loose. Its a nice dress but it would look better on a tall curvy girl."
3.0,"Product is really small, good keychain."
3.0,"I bought this set as a present for my boyfriend for an anniversary gift. Everything was wonderfully made and very sturdy (including the chains), and I would have been happy to pay 23 dollars if it wasn't for the fact that I was given a duplicate of a sword that didn't even fit in the slot it was put in. Despite that, If I had to buy it all over again I would still buy it. My boyfriend loved it, and on top of that when I went to the sellers they did offer a partial refund. Which (to me) was good enough considering it wasn't an overwhelming problem."
3.0,"Nothing to rave about, really, but I love the colors."
3.0,"They are very small, and the product says on it that it is meant to fit small for fire safety but hopefully someone is not letting a 2-year-old hang out around a fire.  They are cute though just sized badly and that should be posted on the area where you order them.."
3.0,Bigger than expected. Kinda oversized but still nice for the price.
3.0,These are really cute but more for people w multiple piercings to stack. Way too small if you only want them for one piercing. It looks laughable alone that’s how small they are.
3.0,"Well, these are cute, but not recommended if you don't want a high waist. I don't think they are very comfortable because the waist is tiny and does come up higher than what it looks like in the photo. Material is very thin. If they were a little lower in the waist, I would give them a better review."
3.0,"I loved the style of the dress but, it ran smaller then the size description so definitely order larger than actual size you think you need plus I'm larger on top."
3.0,Runs small. I would prefer a size bigger.
3.0,Quality was decent but the fit is very loose and boxy.
3.0,This is a little small in the bust but fits well everywhere else and looks nice
3.0,"The blouse ran a little small and the fabric is thin and uncomfortable. I love the look and the style though. The color looks a little cheap and faded. I thought it would be more of a sunshine yellow but it’s really more of a faded canary. Also, because it is smaller than I expected, I have to pull it down because the front rides up a little at the bust area. Like the blouse was made with someone with smaller bossoms. I really love the sleeves though."
3.0,"Ordered a Medium and it feels a little small in the butt area (and don't get any idea, I don't have a big butt to blame this on). Won't take this puppy to the gym but is a great lounge around the apartment item."
3.0,"The mask is a good size, well fitting and comfortable unfortunately the whole point to buying it was for the image and the way that they have stitched The mask you cannot see the raccoon's hands which defeats the purpose 🤷"
3.0,Did not like the black only because it make your hands black after wearing them.
3.0,Fit as expected but the print was not. Returned.
3.0,I like the bracelet but disappointed that it doesn't glow in the dark like described.
3.0,They’re cheap plastic but they’ll protect your eyes from the beam. Only reservation I had is that they seemed like they were used before as they had some scratches on them already when I got them.
3.0,Fits as expected. Snug fit. Soft. Durability doesn’t look promising. Not great for pressing heat transfer vinyl. Good shape. Would recommend for a cheap plain shirt for simple outfits.
3.0,It was gift for my daughter
3.0,"When I filtered for little girl earrings, these earrings appeared in my search. I loved the earrings (color & sparkle); however they were far too large for a 7 year old."
3.0,"The fit was a bit large, I felt no upper support although the suit was nice designed to give support.  I feel had it been a size smaller I would've been delighted with the product overall."
3.0,"Somehow the material is shrink after wash, it's getting short length and banging on my son belly, unless if you make your kids wear a sweater it won't be a matter to put on. It's still good quality of material though."
3.0,The design of the flower is falling out and is somewhat loose. And had an odor  when arrived home so quality control is not that great.
3.0,"Cute style. Would have looked perfect with leggings. It's a few inches above my knee and I'm only 5'3"" so I would have worn with leggings.  I had to return because it was too tight in my chest. I ordered XL and I have a 40D bra. Too tight."
3.0,Thought I would try something for back support.  I don't like the hooks on the straps.  It may work great for others.
3.0,It was larger than I expected. Pretty though.
3.0,"Found these to run on the small side, and although the patterns are fun/funky/bright, they don't really go with a lot of outfits. One point that I will make is that while I very carefully hand-washed these and had no problem, my husband threw one through the washing machine. Don't do that! I can't even quite describe what happened, but the hat was unusable after that."
3.0,Too bulky and heavy even before I put anything in it. Beautiful  design  though.
3.0,"It looks reasonable, but it does not look fine"
3.0,"Quality is questionable, but you get what you pay for. Dress is as described and cute. Shipping takes a while since it comes abroad. Fits my chubby 11 month old so I’m excited to use it for her birthday photo shoot. Overall I like it (I just don’t love it). The only issue I have is the “one” is printed way too low on the top so the elastic band covers it slightly and makes it wrinkled. I don’t like how it’s not centered.<br />One plus is that ours did not have any strong chemical smells, as others mentioned in their reviews. I threw it in the wash and dryer and it came out great."
3.0,Product itself is very nice - initially.  I have had this only a few months and now the silver finish is wearing away and the pendant looks tarnished.
3.0,Fit and looked great on my but wore the black one and it tore up same day. Yet to see about the other
3.0,"I was really excited to get these, I'd been looking for this type of lens for a long time and after looking at them for months decided to buy them. When they came in they were exactly what I was hoping for and were well packaged. Whenever I wore these I received a lot of comments for their uniqueness.<br /><br />I didn't wear them a whole lot at first but started giving them a lot of use over the past 6 months. Just recently though the hinge on the right temple broke. I was disappointed because they were simply hanging in my pocket, they weren't bent or dropped. Was kind of let down that a pair of sunglasses costing this much could break over basically nothing. I'm still willing to call it a fluke this time and will probably purchase another pair sometime in the future."
3.0,"Very cute fashion bracelet because you an barely see the time and difficult to program if you are looking for a basic watch. Yes I would buy again, ad stated it is a nice fashion bracelet."
3.0,"Super cute, but not true to the size. Runs small."
3.0,I don’t know what to say. It’s cute but there is nothing there. I’m not a large person (size 8) and if I put this on my natural waist it doesn’t cover my non-existent butt. So I’m having to put it very low on my hips. We will see how this works for my half marathon but I’m not overly optimistic. This is probably great for child or tween but think twice if your not.
3.0,The hat doesn't stay well on my head.
3.0,Quality not as nice as picture although very warm
3.0,Love the bag but when I pulled it out of the packaging it smelled awful. I've had it for just about a month now & it still smells disgusting.
3.0,"I returned it, it was too small and the quality didn't match the price. It was cute but wouldn't pay that much for it."
3.0,The length of the top is very long. It fit almost to my knees so I had to send it back. The shirt itself was super cute and the fabric soft.
3.0,"The quality of this item is good, but the sizing is not great. It is a fair amount smaller than anticipated and of limited utility."
3.0,The helmet was poorly packaged and it was scratched when I received it. The rubber nose shield was just stuck in the helmet and not attached to the helmet. The tinted eye shield also would not operate.
3.0,"this dress is paper thin, and no where near sized right.  Runs very small, and very disapointing in the fabric.  The colors are nice though and it does seem to be well sewn."
3.0,"The style is very cute and it fit well, however, the spacing on the top was too wide. The two triangle sections felt oddly spaced out and almost in my armpits. I am very small chested (34A), so maybe that’s why. I would imagine someone who is bustier would be revealing a lot of curves up there. For me, I’ll be returning."
3.0,"This was frumpier than I expected. My husband said I looked like his mom in the 80s so that was a HARD PASS. I’m not a skinny person, but I’m fit-ish and it was just not flattering."
3.0,Sturdy necklace for my son. Does what it is supposed to. The one thing I didnt like was trying to figure out how to open it. It came with no instructions on how to open. You have to spin the gold middle portion until it loosens thing turn it over to get the piece out. I had to use a sewing needle to figure that out and nearly damaged the item.
3.0,"These are printed on the front only.  I would give more stars if it were printed on both sides.  As it stands, if someone were to glance at a backpack or whatever and the backside were facing them, they wouldn't know about the medical alert so it's kind of a 50/50 chance of usefulness."
3.0,"This was a beautiful necklace and was excited to wear it. However the chain is more like a choker on me and I'm 5'5 135lbs (I like to think average), which I didn't mind buying a longer chain for it because I loved it so much. However in the week I had it, it has tarnished to a gold color. Now I did have it hanging in my bathroom but it is a fairly large bathroom that doesn't get steamy and none of my other &#34;silver&#34; necklaces have done this. I'm hoping It can be cleaned back to its original self because I love it and haven't even gotten to wear it."
3.0,"The oil was good, but about 1/4 of the can leaked out. I had read previous reviews from many months ago complaining about leakage and I thought surely they have corrected the problem by now. I realize the problem is not with Amazon but with Red Wing. Until Red wind redesigns the nozzle on top of the can there is no way to prevent the leakage. Be prepared to not get full amount if you order this oil."
3.0,"Not bad for heels, and they have the look I wanted, but they run large. My 6.5 felt more like a 7, and given that these will stretch a little over time it means I need to wear super thick socks to keep them from sliding around and giving me a blister on the ball of my foot. Save yourself some trouble and order a half size down."
3.0,"I thought it would be a little bit thicker on the spring coils, they seem to be really thin.  I love the colors, but I am not complaining for what I paid."
3.0,The sizing on this swimsuit is completely wrong based off of the information on amazon. I ordered a XL which says should fit 8-10. It doesn't even come close! It is definitely a size 14/16 instead. The pink in the swimsuit is more of a hot coral color which my daughter loves. Hopefully she will still love it when it fits her 4 years down the road!
3.0,"I guess if you would like to preserve the &#34;quality&#34; of this hoodie, you shouldn't wash or dry it ever."
3.0,"The red dress is very pretty, and the fabric is very nice. I’m disappointed that the dress isn’t proportioned right for me. The overall length of the dress was good. I’m short, and (unlike other similar dresses), it was not too long. The problem is with the top. I wanted to wear this with the sleeves on my shoulders. However, when I pulled the stretchy part over my chest, it caused the neckline to go too low (and it wouldn’t stay in place). I’m a 36DD on top, and I purchased a Large."
3.0,It runs small got my daughter a 7-8 and she might be able  to  wear it again
3.0,"Nice enough coin for the money, thought it would have better weight and quality."
3.0,"At 5'11&#34; I have to say that part of the problem is probably me. From the product photo I expected a below the knee skirt, it's above my knee. Not a miniskirt...but not the lovely tea length I was hoping for. It also wrinkles REALLY bad. Out of the bag - creases...Okay...washed it following the care instructions, hung it to dry...wrinkles...pressed it out...once you sit down in it...wrinkles. Cute style, wish I could wear it without the issues."
3.0,"Everything on it is great, except world had a letter missing spelled word. It's a great size, hopefully they fix the misprint."
3.0,These work but don’t be too rough on them or they will bust super fast!
3.0,"The purse is nice, but much bigger than I expected.  Dimensions stated are misleading. Height from the center of the zipper to the bottom is 9&#34;. Side height is 12&#34;. Width at widest point is actually 15&#34;, not 12&#34;."
3.0,Nice dress. But if your curvy dont recommend because it will make you look really wide and thick.
3.0,Very pretty but did not fit right on me. Too loose on waist
3.0,"I do enjoy this dress, it is as expected. It fits snug up top and the open leg I don’t feel uncomfortable with. My biggest gripe is that straps on the top could be longer, I have a short torso so straps generally aren’t an issue but this one the front rides up a little higher on the chest. It’s not a deal breaker, just and FYI."
3.0,This dress is HUUUUUGE.  It is labeled a small but fits like and extra large.  Fabric and quality are what I expected for the price.  Arrived quickly.
3.0,"The tops was too small and the straps weren’t long enough, might fit a child."
3.0,I thought it was leather... My fault should havs read it better.
3.0,Tight around ankle.
3.0,"I ordered the small black bag.  Upon receipt, the bag looked ok. For me, the quality was a little less than desired. It looked like low-quality leather; a bit on the shiny side.  I could tell that the seams by the handle and zipper will eventually split and crack with wear. You get what you pay for within this price range. I was looking for something more durable, so I returned this bag."
3.0,but cut small
3.0,"This seemed like it might be cute, but it fit oddly. I am not sure what body type this would work for, but it is definitely not for my body type."
3.0,Not the material I was looking for.  Sizes aren't standard (order next size up to two sizes larger).
3.0,These easily fall off my crocs :(
3.0,Fits as expected. I think its so expensive for its quality.
3.0,I’m 5’8 and these were too short for me. Not a good Capri length. Stopped just below the knee. Otherwise good fit and seem like a good quality.
3.0,it was much darker and you can not tell its wood unless you are really looking at it
3.0,The ring came and I was so excited but it looks tarnished. It’s a full silver instead of a new shiny one. It looks almost like it’s old. :( I’ll still wear it but no one will believe I just got this.<br /><br />It was easy enough to resize. I’d love this if it just looked new.
3.0,Only reason I’m giving stars is because the sunflower is so cute. Chain broke in less than a month of wearing it
3.0,A bit roomy and long.
3.0,They were a great price but the tips spread after a few uses.
3.0,"Technically, these appear to be printed backwards. Also, it can give you some serious camel-toe. My wife (who has a D.Va obsession) enjoys that she has these, but ultimately won't wear them."
3.0,"The dress was cute, but the lace kept getting caught in the zipper/it was difficult to zip :("
3.0,The short are real nice but too large.
3.0,The material was very thick and didn't breathe. Since I was looking for a nice summer skirt or something to go over leggings this isn't what I wanted and I returned it. However it was not see through and if I wanted a thick mini skirt it would be great.
3.0,Handy to have... I found the Clip on a wee bit tight so stretch it some being careful not to damage.  The near idea of a stitch on pouch for a phone is good but I a little insecure as the cover doesn't full cover lenses..
3.0,"I ordered this shirt and once received I tried it on (pre-washing). The XXL is HUGE. Generally speaking this would not be a problem but I ordered according to the size chart and found myself swimming in fabric. The XL was reported to be a 36&quot; bust which is well under my size and so I ordered a size up. The printing is nice, and the material is OK. If I were to order from this company again I would order a size smaller than normal for a better fit.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,Didn’t like the color or the cap sleeve..
3.0,Beautiful dress but runs very small and to return the dress is not very easy at all.  Big disappointment.
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, but my measurements seemed closer to a small for this dress, so I ordered a small. It fit me well, but the belt would have been too big for anyone with a smaller waist than me (and my waist is an inch or two bigger than the measurements listed for the small). The dress doesn’t have any belt loops, so just keep that in mind for the belt too. The dress wrinkles incredibly easily. I only wore it for a few hours and when I got home, it looked like it’d been sitting crumpled up in my dirty clothes hamper for a few days before I wore it. Maybe starching it would help, but I’m not sure. Overall, it’s a cute dress, but it does have some issues."
3.0,I like this belt but I was hoping it would look more like leather but maybe with time it will get worn in and look like that.
3.0,I usually wear a medium so I ordered a large I could not zip these up. Seem like a nice product just order two sizes bigger than you think you need. The company was also no help figuring out what size I should order
3.0,Good quality for the price and the length is great for the office
3.0,Bodice is a little small
3.0,Not see through. Thick material but the bottoms were too big
3.0,"Very cute but the bottom part of the three ""dots"" gets kinda buried in the skin and left a little bruise on my belly button. Can't wear it anymore"
3.0,Thought I ordered the brown color but received a very orange toned one instead. Need belt now so i kept it but will have to still find a brown one. Also it seems to have really stretched out since I bout it. Started on first hole and now I'm on third one already.  Thats in less then two weeks.
3.0,"The words are wonderful.  The shape and size are terrific.  However, the material is a bit cheap.  A decoration more than an item to wear."
3.0,Undecided how I feel about these. They are just stretchy material sewn to make a tube. Like the sleeve of a shirt. Thought there would be more creativity..elastic..something other than just this.
3.0,Is not so beutiful than the pictures
3.0,Nice but to small for my 11 year old.
3.0,Nice beach bag but the interior (only) zippered pocket is not large enough to hold a phone.
3.0,very wrinkled but ended up a great look and fit!
3.0,It was bigger than I wanted and longer than I wanted
3.0,not as thick as I like but it worked.....
3.0,"Bit small and too short, it’s more like a T-shirt dress and I’m 5’8” so I will probably return. It hits my legs mid thigh and doesn’t cover anything when I bend over. Other than the size issue it was a nice cool material and had another piece of material lightly lined in the chest (not padded and if you have a small chest it looks fine, I don’t think this dress would fit good on larger chests). Also the shoulder straps are not adjustable."
3.0,"True to color,but smaller than expected. How ever,it's still cute for the price."
3.0,"Beautiful purse, arrived quickly & in perfect condition. Sadly, returning. Purchased to use at my son's wedding where I hope to take photos using my cellphone...Cellphone did not fit in purse. My phone measures 5.5&#34; x 3&#34;...purse wouldn't open wide enough or close with phone:((("
3.0,5'2. 176 lbs Large.<br /><br />I Like the dress but not a MUST have for the price.  Pros: Comfortable and with a wedge shoe the length will work.  Color is nice.  Cons:  Can find better quality for the price at other discount stores.  I would pay $10 if I saw it in a store but not $23.  Wrinkles easily after ironing with starch
3.0,"If you are busty (I’m 34” DDD), this probably isn’t for you. The first pleat hits higher than I would like - right across my chest - and it’s just not a flattering fit. I have been on a bender buying these cute tunic dresses featured on lightning deals to wear with leggings... but this one didn’t work. The price was right, though - so I’ll just pass along to my teenage daughter."
3.0,Nice shirt. Order size larger. Not as shimmery as picture. But I love it.
3.0,My daughter LOVED the color and print (she is a cat fanatic)  but the armholes are too large (had to tack them down to make it fit right).
3.0,"I thought this was going to be a ring leader kind of coat, I wanted it to be a little longer but ends up it was a lot shorter than I expected.<br /><br />It does look super pretty and the fabric is not the best but it is worth the try.<br /><br />It lasted a good while and I still have it.<br /><br />I am happy with it honestly.<br /><br />so I will probably have a lot of use out of this.<br /><br />I love the colour I got and I also like the way it was made.<br /><br />I will keep it and I will use it a lot more."
3.0,Way too small!!!<br />Buy 2 or 3 sizes bigger.<br />Very cute and good material
3.0,Soft material. Just a little too small. I wish it was a more slouch hat. It's super tight. I really can't wear it.
3.0,"I love this dress but it is definitely a fixer upper.<br />I'm 5&#34;7 and 155lbs, so I got a large because really I'm in between the medium and the large.<br />It's too big around the waist by an inch, so I need to take it to be altered. The breast padding as well is weird. It goes about two inches above my breast making it look really awkward. When I fold in the top of the breast it looks great so I need to get that altered as well.<br /><br />I got the dress for $26 and it's going to be about $30 to alter it, making it a $56 dollar dress. However I really love it, so my boyfriend offered to pay for the alterations.<br /><br />If you're willing to take your chances because you absolutely love the dress and see yourself wearing it on more than one occasion then do it! If not, shop around and maybe you'll stumble across something just right for you."
3.0,Compression is just great but they’re sized a bit short in the calf for me (I’m just over 6 ft. (and ordered large. )
3.0,"I thought the material was decent not too thin,  yet light weight;  fits but a little tighter then expected."
3.0,"Socks larger than image; quality semi-poor. Instead of giving them to my bf, I asked if my brother wanted them! Couldn't do a return. Would I buy more? The answer is def. not. Upgrade yourself to a higher brand/quality."
3.0,"Not too small but tighter than I thought. I think it's because I'm taller than the reviews I read. I'm 5'6, 130 lbs. the sides don't slouch as much as they do stick out which is kind of a bummer. I wear it to bed and around the house but sadly I can't wear it out"
3.0,"I bought this sweater last minute, it was warm and matched it over a pea coat that I had worn.  However it was to short from the shoulders to torso length.  It was just shy to the belt line and felt like a defect item.  I wear large and length on arms were good just very short on the torso area for whatever reason."
3.0,"Every time I wear these shoes I have to put on two bandages on each foot, so that the back of the shoe won't peel off my skin. And even with the bandages, it still hurts."
3.0,I like it but it to big I prefer danty
3.0,"I love the detail, but should have a camera opening on the cover b/c it covers the cam when flipped back, maybe obvious but still"
3.0,Very nice look but will break easily. Wear carefully
3.0,"Our son loved this mask when it came in the mail, but every time he wears it, he complains that it’s really hot and he can’t breathe well through it. Not cool when you’re already struggling to get your kid to wear a mask in the first place. That said, it does look just like the picture and has good construction."
3.0,. Size 9/10 snug fit for 9 1/2.
3.0,The back of the earrings bend very easily.
3.0,Buenas pero raspa la costura tienes q usar calcetines largo
3.0,"The jacket is cute but it did not quite fit me. I can put it on but I can't fasten the button. Fortunately, it does not feel too tight within the shoulders. It feels nice but I can't say that it's the best quality."
3.0,"You absolutely, positively MUST buy a weight for this. It will not stay upright with the umbrella otherwise. The quality is great other wise and easy to put together but it's a bit disappointing that it's useless with out a weight."
3.0,This is a nice work dress. A little see through but overall a quality dress to wear to work for a very reasonable price.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, it’s cute, light and perfect for summer. I am 5’1 and 120 lbs and ordered a S. It fit just right everywhere except the length. Sadly, the length was a little too short for my liking. The color is more of a khaki than the bright green pictured in the images. Pretty and casual, will probably return for a medium"
3.0,"5'-7"" 140lbs ordered a Medium.  The dress is perfect and flattering and fit as expected just like on the model (maybe could have even gone one size smaller for a snugger fit), except for ONE BIG PROBLEM: the boobs.<br /><br />You'd think that slight fabric scrunching at the chest is so that your boobs can fill out that area, right?  Wrong.  There's a totally flat panel right behind the scrunched panel at the chest, which means you end up with some wrinkly saggy material hanging off the front of your boobs which (even at my small B size) are screwing up the top of the nice contouring waist because the chest is sewn to be even flatter than the stomach.<br /><br />If my boobs were C's, I might have risked cutting the flat boob panel away and letting my boobs fill the scrunched area.  That might work for someone bigger chested than me, because if it weren't for the boobs problem, this dress is fantastic."
3.0,Looks good on but after a week it starts to rust from the shower. Wish the quality was better.
3.0,"I liked it until I washed it.  Used cold water, delicate cycle, air dry.  The body of the dress was fine, but the thin straps came out frayed and twisted beyond repair."
3.0,(Wife here) I'm  5'7&#34; and curvy. (Maybe 310 pounds)  This dress would have been perfect for me.  It was just on the negative side of highlighting absolutely every single curve.  It fit and didn't fit.  Just a 1 centimeter more at the at the waist and hips would have made all the difference.  This could have been a spectacular dress. This could have been a dress I would buy in every single color that I wear.
3.0,"This dress doesn't look like the photo. The straps should be tapered. Instead this dress looks like a maxi tank top.<br /><br />On the plus, it's super stretchy if that's what you're looking for and not sheer at all.<br /><br />I got a big size so it would look more flowh, but it just looks like a long tank top dress. So it's hard to dress that up. I can use it for to and from the beach or tanning salon but other than that, I don't see me wearing it much. 😒"
3.0,"Okay, so the swimsuit itself is very cute. I haven't had any trouble with it fading! But I'm 5&#34;4 and it's too short. My boobs hangout way more than I prefer. And I ordered an XL (I weigh 142lbs) and it was too small. Not to small to wear, but just tight enough to where I wish it was bigger."
3.0,Poor quality mesh. Denim ok. Not as expexted.
3.0,It is great quality. My only complaint is it only came with one bow on one strap and not one on each like pictured.
3.0,These fish charms are cute but you’re quite a few other sellers that have them for a cheaper price
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:3c47a641e00448c4966daa9b5476c013]] Light weight purse. Enough space for necessities but quality is just kind of cheap. The chunky chain is plastic , the longer thin chain is more so a light metal material. Purse rhinestones look decent not too bad but once one starts to come apart it looks like the rest will follow. I guess it’s cute for show."
3.0,"I knew this item was copper plated brass upon ordering it.<br />I thought that wouldn't matter, since the pendulum itself would hardly be handled. Mine arrived with several large flaws on it. One is on the tip of the weight, where there is a large, irregular groove in the metal. On several other parts of the spiral, the copper has already worn or flaked off, leaving a series of dark, almost black flecks all over it. I've attempted to gently polish it with no luck. It's very apparent when running your finger over it that it's missing plating, and not tarnish.<br />I'm disappointed, but still willing to see what this pendulum has in store for me."
3.0,"The sweater is cute and the materiLnis soft, but it is a bit short for me. To be fair, the measurements specified seem to be accurate. However, the sweater is quite boxey and since it is so short, it just didnt look right. Had to return it."
3.0,"My husband ordered these thinking they were Lugz. They are not, but he says the fit and feel are ok."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. It was exactly what I was looking for. However, when it arrived it was a bit smaller than the measurements the seller provided. Still, the cut and fabric are really nice. I have worn it to the office with a long cardigan, and it worked. Until the THIRD time I wore it, and my fingers went right through the fabric. I mean like they would go through gauze. So... waste of money. :("
3.0,I didn't find where to choose the size when I place the order.  But I did like it. Then I unfortunately received a XL size that could not be exchanged to M size.
3.0,The rubber ear cover was loose in the first week of use.
3.0,This is a really nice top. Nice color. But in the picture it seemed the top was long in the back. The shirt is way short. Hits me right at the hips.
3.0,"Just recieved  them. There's a large hole in the heel of one. Besides that, they seem nice."
3.0,Very pretty dress but not the right one for me.
3.0,Works if you don't have a lot of options but they are larger than they appear online and could be softer.
3.0,"I got a small and it runs large, I have to keep pulling the pants up because they are lose on my waist. The top is ok because it is too big and I am a 34 ddd I am 5’1 and 127 pounds. Also it is VERY shiny. It doesn’t fit fitted like in the photo at all. Only thing is the softness is nice."
3.0,"Beautiful but very cheap, the clasp broke after a month"
3.0,"The buttons are see on wrong side of shirt. So to wear it wrong side or I had to cut out tag with Seam ripper. So the shirt is still cute, but it did get sewn wrong side out."
3.0,"Nice idea but I'm 5' 8&#34; and they were WAY too short! Also a tad too small. The clasp that attaches the straps is VERY cheap. I can see that breaking. No thanks sending these back,"
3.0,These are pretty but I am really sad they aren't purple. I am not much on just earrings that are fake diamond looks. They looked so pretty in the purple choice I ordered. They are a bit heavy too in the ears. Not at all like the photo shown in description.
3.0,Colors aren’t great but sizing was perfect and super thin which I like. Very comfortable
3.0,Fits small and the material is thin
3.0,"These joggers are just okay for me. They’re much more fitted than I expected and are very thin. They feel less like joggers and more like pajama pants. They’re very high waisted and look awkward on someone with a short torso like me. I washed and dried them normally and had no issues. Personally, I just don’t like the fit and probably won’t wear them again since I don’t wear pajama pants."
3.0,"Both my wife and I have ordered one of these XXL  within couple of days of each other. The one that my wife received was acceptable, not great, but ok.<br />Mine *which is brown)  had significant (several inches long)  black marker/sharpie mark or  discoloration plus  several  pockmarks.  This one needed to be returned.  Since our luck was 50/50, YMMV."
3.0,"Top worked fine since it ties at neck and back, but the bottom was snug despite me fitting in the same size in another suit of the same brand. Also, the skirting flared too low (below the hip instead of flaring from it), which is not flattering. I am returning it."
3.0,Takes a while to get used to the release system.  There is a trick to releasing the belt..have to push in slightly like you are ratcheting it up to a tighter fit and then press the release button and pull away.
3.0,One side of the shorts wasn’t like yen picture on the photo . Both sides look alike .
3.0,Sat for a week and mould started growing on the top. Little toe did not really fit in well so sandals are still sitting in the cupboard with only one use!
3.0,These pants ran small. Super cute but I had to return them
3.0,Very loose fit and I wear a 16.5 neck.
3.0,"Runs a little small, but it's nice."
3.0,came undone on me within 2 days.
3.0,"I was very excited to try these pants. I order them size small in gray and black. I tried the gray on first and was pleased with the fit. The length was as expected, just above my ankle, and since the waistband is elastic, it could move anywhere from my belly button to my hips. Then I tried on the black pair and was dissapointed. The black pair was much larger and looser fitting, so loose that the inseam/crotch seam uncomfortably rubbed against my inner thighs. The inconsistent sizing is unfortunate, as it seems I would be taking a gamble on another color in the same size or a black in a smaller size."
3.0,The 'pair' I received were exactly the same - they were NOT mirror images - the flat leaves on the right were on the right for each ear rather than one being left side 'flat'.  Not all that comfortable - pads fell out first wearing.  Bought other pads and now they are OK comfort wise.  Maybe nobody notices that they are identical on the ears but it bothers me.
3.0,Soft fabric ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br />Great fit.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br />White is not white. It’s off-white. ⭐️<br />Sleeves sonr
3.0,Here is a colorful pack of boxers but they do feel a bit snug when I first put them on.  After about a day or two I did feel a little more comfortable than my initial opinion.  I still wish I had gotten one size bigger.  They are also a bit thin which obviously will be better in the summer than in the winter.  It also probably means they may not last as long as other brands.  There is also a slot in the front like many boxers but there is no button like some I own.
3.0,It's super small an I washed it in cold an it went from black to looking like I owned it for 10 years🙄
3.0,"Beautiful color and nice fabric. However, the two tie pieces are at both open ends. This results in a fully open dress. It seems as though there are missing strings to tie to wrap it. Disappointed it didn’t work."
3.0,"Pretty, keeps time, good clasp. I was afraid it would be gaudy, and it might if you tried to make it a statement piece against a simple background. I throw it on with a gold bangel and some bead bracelets and the multiple gaudy cancels itself out and you get bohemian."
3.0,My daughter LOVED these. They fit really well and she loved the design. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of five is because two of them came with holes under the waist area. For what you’re paying I expected more. Too much of a hassle to return so I  kept the 4 good ones.
3.0,not the best quality but still good for a gag gift
3.0,"I bought this for my wife. I'm not, nor do I care about these things, she was happy with it."
3.0,Too light for winter. Might be good with long sleeved Tshirt underneath.
3.0,"I love this top... I was thinking maybe it would be tight in my size so I got the Large, well, it's a little large so I will try to shrink it in the wash.... I shoulda stuck with my own normal size...but...I still love it!"
3.0,The blue is quite nice but the red arrived with holes. Only partially sewn. Not worth it to mail it back.
3.0,No seems on neck or sleeves
3.0,These are super cute but I had a hard time keeping them on. The clasps is very cheaply made and the top part Dallas off easily.
3.0,"This may be a case of expectations, but I thought the bands would have the FIXED easy release the original band, as well as other replacement bands, have.  The original has a easy release link (that I love!) that stays put into the band.  The ones included with this product are loose; the customer has to insert them into the bands, and when removed those links can get lost.<br /><br />I cannot rate its durability, right now.  Time will tell."
3.0,"It's a nice ring for its price. suitable for accational wear. Mot compatible with cleaning supplies, since the colour wears off and it makes your finger green."
3.0,Cloth is too thin/transparent and I did not like the loose fit around waist.
3.0,Look nice on but the earrings are a bit too heavy for me. And my ear lobes itch at the piercing after I take them off. I don’t wear them anymore but I still have them.
3.0,"cute Lulu dupe for the price.  The fabric is a bit thicker than expected, but it is still a comfortable weight.  My only issue is that this sweatshirt is slim in the arms and through the shoulders.  I am able to wear it, but it isn't as comfortable as I'd like.  The cropped length is nice, can be worn with leggings or jeans.  Maybe sizing up would help with the tightness in shoulders and arms."
3.0,Fitts like it was made more for females.
3.0,I didn't realize this came in two separate pieces until I got it. The shirt part fit great except the back on it was velcro and I wish it was a zipper since I bend over a lot at my job. The overalls on the other hand were a bit big. The sleeves kept coming down so I had to safety pin it to my shirt so it would stay up. I did like how modest this dress though so it was perfect to wear at my job.
3.0,i was under the impression this product has ability to super warm your feet.  they work equal to a wool pair of socks.  nothing more.
3.0,looks very nice in picture but very flimsy
3.0,my daughter bought this then he get's traded
3.0,"Quality is good, looks and feels like it is actually made for women and not men, size runs small, should have gotten a extra large"
3.0,I did not like the materials.design is ok.
3.0,"the rings are fine, but the shipping took almost a month and a half"
3.0,"Dress would be very flattering if it wasn’t so see-through. also, runs fairly small. I would probably suggest sizing up."
3.0,"Pluses<br />This is a nice well made canvas bag with leather accents.  Looks good.<br />It has actual snaps on the flap unlike the magnetic closures found on some other bags.<br />Holds it shape well when lightly loaded.  Some others don't look very attractive without a little weight to maintain the shape.<br />Center compartments can be zippered shut for additional security for when the flap is not snapped shut.<br />Shoulder strap provides great support even if the flap isn't closed.<br /><br />Minuses<br />It really is a tad on the small side.  I wanted to carry a small ultrabook in the bag along with some small peripherals, a couple of notepads, etc.  Basically light office type of content.  I tried out my wife's 11&#34; MacBook Air since my 13&#34; ASUS zenbook hadn't arrived.  The padded compartment is barely able to accommodate the MacBook when I have it in a sleeve.  It sticks out of top of the compartment but I am able to get the snap fastener to engage.  I like the additional padding of the sleeve because I don't think the messenger bag has enough in the padded compartment.  Believe them when they say that it is great for an iPad.  It really is designed for only a tablet.  One of the other reviewers stated that they were able to fit a 13 inch notebook but I don't think I will be trying that with the ASUS.<br /><br />This is good for a student for a couple of notebooks, perhaps a small textbook and your iPad.  Nothing more.<br /><br />I would not buy this product again.  No gripes on the quality but I have only used it twice.  It just doesn't have enough capacity.  I would return the bag but it does clearly say its for an iPad.  I just thought that since the bag is 14 inches wide, it should have been able to fit an 11 inch laptop as well.  My bad."
3.0,It was very comfy and soft but unfortunately only after wearing it a few hours it ripped up the sleeve and I dont know how it happened but it was disappointing. I’ll mend it myself eventually as it’s an easy fix at least.
3.0,Looked really nice. But one day after about a month it just started pinching my wrist so bad I couldn't wear it until I changed it back to my original band. Like it left a small bruise and it was not tight at all. I was bummed too because I really liked the look but it just didn't hold up.
3.0,they do not fit my newborn. will have to wait until next summer for her to wear them.
3.0,"The color was vibrant, but fit is somewhat small."
3.0,"2/6 masks were damaged upon arrival. The damages masks were poorly stitched together. The other 4 were fine, and 3 of those have held up over the weeks."
3.0,"So I see I'm not alone. Yup looks great, but months later feels liked your grabbing a sandwich bag full of keys and needles from the metal strands that start to unravel...bummer too cause I got allot of compliments.oh well, fun while it lasted."
3.0,"This is a little big for my petite frame. Not super quality, but I needed a black dress and it was ok."
3.0,They weren't the same as I purchased before. I really didn't like the fit and I didn't like the quality
3.0,"This is a cute shirt. The price is OK. I love linen fabric and i do not think that this is 100% linen. It seems to be a poly/ linen blend as it has a little roughness to it unlike the unique feel of pure linen. As far as auality it is medium. Not impressed by it. So if you fall for the look, go for it. The price is ok for what it is."
3.0,"The fabric of the shirt was nice and soft and it seemed like good quality but it was sewn in a slightly odd way, not too bad though I would kept  it if it was the right color, the green part of the shirt was kind of a dark olive-green, not the color it showed in the picture.<br />So I am returning it."
3.0,"Received mine pretty quickly after ordering.  It's cute, but only problem is the wings aren't flat.  This has caused mine to not sit flat on my wrist after wearing a few times and the wing ends rub into your skin causing a little irritation if left on.  However, we all know beauty is pain &, other than that, it is still a cute bracelet and I will continue to wear it!"
3.0,I liked the print. The colors were bright. The price was fair. I would have given 4 stars if the top fit better. Runs bigger than other prints of this exact same style code.
3.0,Cheap material is not breathable and I felt uncomfortably hot in minutes but it will be a cute costume dress for anything super shiny... I'm thinking robot.
3.0,"The 1/2 price discount is the only reason why I bought these reading glasses. Previous purchases couple years ago of the same item was top quality, but not now. The design & style changed. Lucky for me I have a supply of the old good ones."
3.0,This hooked up okay on my watch however when it gets wet it stays wet for a long time before it dries the silicone ones are more user-friendly.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:391d3680e808563132a669137d1d581]] I don't know how to put my phone number on the key strap. Other than that it is very nice, feels secure."
3.0,I was a little disappointed but maybe I expected too much.
3.0,"Good jacket, but crazy thin."
3.0,"They're bite but not a true all size fits all. This are more for children, teen or adults with small feet. I'm a size 11 and although they did fit they were all stretched out and so no longer looked cute. I was very disappointed"
3.0,The fabric is a bit strange feeling and is quite light weight but it was for a tiny lady and it fits her fine. We needed a pink one to go with some of her house coats so it works.
3.0,"Love the deep dark chocolate brown! Also, made very well. However, did not care for the style at all. Sizing was a little small and flared out too much for my liking. If I would order the next size up there would have been way too much material."
3.0,The earrings are very pretty.  The necklace is very large though.  I will not be wearing such a large necklace but the owl is pretty.
3.0,"Product looked just like the photo, it fits comfortably and works well as a mask. I tried to teach in it, but the fabric is dense and it fits very closely to the face, making it difficult to speak clearly. If you’re a professor, it makes for a good mask, but not one to wear while speaking clearly to a room full of people."
3.0,It's Ok. It's really nice to always have my credit cards and ID with me all the time but it does not seem so sturdy as it's starting to break already. Took many weeks to be shipped to me.
3.0,Not what I thought when it came
3.0,"Very pretty, just as pictured, but broke fast."
3.0,"This stand is a cute design with the little birds, but would be better if it was 3d. there are a lot of little branches but they are real close together and chains tend to want to tangle, The height is to short for longer chains unless you double up the chain this also adds to the tangle problem. I do like the fact that the base is a nice deep dish. It is nice for rings, smaller bracelets and maybe chokers. But as I said before longer necklaces chains then tend to tangle."
3.0,Very cute ring. Love the style and fit of it. My only gripe is that it cannot get wet AT ALL. I forgot I was wearing it and washed my hands half way before I realized. There's now a dark discoloration behind the stone. Super bummed. Otherwise great product.
3.0,I bought xl and it is a bit big .A large would have been better.Although it is lined it is still see through.
3.0,"Totally loved this blouse, however it is too small despite the fact that i chose a size that would have fit, gave it to a friend as a gift. Though i am disappointed its a lovely blouse."
3.0,Pretty but runs small.  Fabric is light weight so not winter appropriate.
3.0,"The watch looks cool. I'm afraid it does not keep time when stowed in an expensive automatic watchwinder. It's best to just wear it as often as you can. I still like it. I thought the box shown would come with thw watch, but .. nope. It's ok."
3.0,The outfit was cute but the shirt was too tight
3.0,Very nice; easy to care for.
3.0,"The shoe is comfortable. I usually wear 8.5M. The 9 fits fine. The heel is about 4.5 inches with a 1 inch platform. The sole is the same color as the shoe which is a nice touch. The shoe is solid with a wider heel, but workmanship and material quality looks poor. They would probably hold up for a few special occasions. The main problem is the bow. One is loose and slides off center which makes it look cheap. I would have given 4 stars for the shoe, but apparently the pair I received had been returned by someone else and had signs of wear."
3.0,They were far too tight.
3.0,Cheaply made but fun. Also can't beat the price
3.0,Cute suspenders.  A little on the small side.  I'd say best for kids under 5.  I wish the back was adjustable like the front. It did the trick for my son's pioneer days at school.  Wore them for 9 days with no issues.  Just wish they were a little bigger.  My son is a size 7 and they were a tad too small.
3.0,It is smaller than I expected (my bad for not really verifying dimensions). Recommend you qualify the dimensions before purchase.  But it looks good even if a little small.
3.0,"I bought 3 pairs of these leggings in camo, Navajo, and black.  The camo and Navajo fit perfect and are soft and comfortable.  The black pair is so tight I couldn't even get them on.  I double checked to make sure that they were plus-size, and they are, but they are way smaller than the others.  I gave the black ones to a friend who is small and they fit her well."
3.0,I got them for a Thin Man evening lol. Honestly they were SO staticky that I ripped them off as soon as I could at the end of the night and donated them. Would not recommend.
3.0,These pins looked so much better in their picture. I returned others that were damaged or inferior in quality. Kept these as they were the best of the bunch. Will not re- purchase.
3.0,"Good,, but broke after uses."
3.0,Not good for yoga because the size I ordered that would fit tightly according to the size chart (L) is loose on the bottom and so flips during head/hand stands. The pink is slightly tighter than the blue & black but still not great.
3.0,Very pretty- but it's quite a large cross. The chain it comes with is pretty but rips the hair out of your head...
3.0,After my purchased I found out they are overpriced. They feel good but I will not recommended if you need Wide fit.
3.0,"No stretch, and there is no room in the chest to zip. I wear 38 DDD, and it did not fit on top."
3.0,"I like the dress, but it is too small.  I purchased multiple XL dresses and this is the smallest sized XL I received."
3.0,"These are very nice glasses and come in a very nice case.<br />They did not take glare away, they made it all yellow. This may be what they were supposed to do.<br />I dont get any relief from them ,actually found it hard to adjust to all the yellow. I bought to use<br />for night driving."
3.0,"This is not for someone looking for an oversized fit. The material is amazing, as is the quality. So wished it would fit better"
3.0,"The back was fine except for the zippers. They are very large and gold colored. Maybe it’s the fashion, they look like something that should be on some big hardware items instead of a purse.  I am blind so I didn’t know this until the bag arrived."
3.0,Cloth is ok. Fits is not exactly as shown in the photo. Overall its ok not great wouldn't consider buying again.
3.0,"Cute, soft and fit well. However I expected 4pair and only received 3."
3.0,"I was expeting diferent material, the color es red brillant, not dark red as the picture , oh well"
3.0,I would buy one size up from your usual size ...and it is more of a spring dress cause the material is too hot for the summer
3.0,"My wife complains about how tight they are, they almost have a compression pants feel so they get a little uncomfortable after an extended period of time. But boy do they make that booty pop! Her booty be like, DAAAAAAAAAAAM!"
3.0,They were a little too large for my liking.
3.0,"They are really pretty but one of the posts was crooked pointing down. Still fits in my ear, but the back is harder to get on. I'm not gonna try to bend it back up incase the post snaps off, but they are good for the price."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, quick ship, but was way to small for daughter so returning."
3.0,"Great material, super warm and comfortable. Zipper seems to stick a little. The back has &#34;LA&#34; in the same blue as front. Grey not black. Smaller than a US small."
3.0,Really roomy and the fabric texture is a little rubbery/ bouncy rather than flowing.  It looks great with jeggins
3.0,Love this dress! Fits great and looks super cute. Can be dressed up or down depending on shoes. Aaand it has pockets!<br /><br />Update : first time wearing it i noticed that the seem was ripping in several places. It even ripped a Nile right below the pocket. Definitely not well made at all. Too bad.
3.0,I like the charm but it's just to small
3.0,"I actually like these socks a lot, but there is no way that they would fit a man. They are advertised as men's socks and are supposed to fit men with shoe sizes 6 to 11. Right out of the package, they fit ME quite well (just a little roomy). I am a woman and wear a size 6 1/2 shoe (small feet). After washing and drying, they are comfortable and even a bit snug on my foot. I decided to keep them and give them to my daughters, who also have small feet, rather than shipping them back for a refund. I would give these a 5-star rating if they were larger.<br /><br />I've edited this review to add a photo of one of the black socks after washing in lukewarm water and drying on extra low for about 10 minutes just to take some of the dampness out. It's soooooo small!"
3.0,It's well made and pretty. It has a nice zipper. But when I put my cards in I had trouble closing and zipping it. It's fine if you only have a few cards. It needs to. E deeper in order to close it. I think I will return it. I ordered it due to the number of cards it claimed it could hold and the sturdy zipper.
3.0,This ring was pretty but a little cheap looking I still like it. It came on time. I'm satisfied didn't cost much so I'm happy with it. Was packaged well.
3.0,"Comes in a ridiculous, generic box with no way to secure the bead for gift giving."
3.0,The earrings are ok but the hook that goes through your is so tiny that only a small child could wear them. I am going to give them to my 7 year old granddaughter as they were too small for my ear lobe!  They are also very light weight and flimsy.
3.0,"UPDATE: The listing now does include the band length in the title.<br /><br />The band itself seems to be the same quality as the original band. However, the listing did not mention which length the band was. I assumed, incorrectly, that it would come with both the sm/med and med/lg along with the main band with the metal peg. Many other bands I have ordered have come this way. So unfortunately for me, the band is too small. Hopefully the seller will make the correction to their description or perhaps offer both lengths in the future."
3.0,"Something about the midsection didn't work for me. It fit well at the waist. I think it was about the pocket placement, with my torso. Ended up returning."
3.0,"The jumpsuit got here super fast. It fit OK and tied in the back. I don't like how the stripes in the front and back of the shorts do not line up. It looks cheap and mismatched. I will probably wear it once for the 4th of July and toss it after. I think they try to hide that flaw in the pictures by bunching it up in the front, but then it is really noticeable in the back. $15 lesson learned."
3.0,Very light weight should have spent a littleire forore durability.
3.0,This was not sweat shirt material.  Nice design and fit but horrid fabric.
3.0,These worked great for the beach and water park.  The only reason only 3 stars is the  inside kept coming up in my 7 year old sons pair.  He constantly had to stop and adjust the bottom in order to walk.
3.0,"For the size I bought, the sleeves were so snug, I can't wear it. Disappointing."
3.0,Got this for my daughter in a medium the too was perfect the the bottom was too big<br />She is  120 pounds and 5'6<br />She had to wear a different bottom
3.0,Nice size but cheap quality
3.0,"As another reviewer stated by complaint is with the shoe and most definitely not with the seller. My shoes arrived promptly and as promised. However, they did not fit the same as the previous versions of the Dyad. I've had at least 4 versions and always found them very comfortable with plenty of room at the toe to accommodate my foot. These feel smaller and squish my toes very u comfortably. I hope Brooks will go back to the previous design."
3.0,"It felt very comfortable but it was smaller than my regular size. I use a size 12 in sandals, and my heel was slightly coming off the back. Buy them a next size larger"
3.0,"Too tight, maybe I bought wrong size."
3.0,"The worst thing about it is that it is so clingy! Lining clings to legs and dress clings to lining, so it does not fall down your legs like it is in the picture, you have to keep peeling it off lining and your legs all the time, bit it does not help for a minute... Returning this one."
3.0,I like the hat but the hat is larger than I expected :(
3.0,"Love the sweater its light weight and comfortable for traveling (flying). Not so impressed with the color, I expected a more vibrant green and got a some what faded green color."
3.0,"I was looking to replace a button with a snap behind it as I like things open. The snap showed when open so I’d have to keep the cardigan snapped when wearing. 💡 a frog closure and then I saw this, it looked perfect something I wouldn’t have to sew on. It arrived fast and when I put it on the cardigan it looked almost perfect except there was too much gap between the sweater front. I think it probably would be great for cape, poncho or even a heavier winter scarf it’s even okay of the cardigan but just alittle too much gap for me."
3.0,Beautiful but the second day the chain an yarn was coming out the back of the necklace
3.0,"fabric is nice, but definitely need to order larger then your normal size!"
3.0,"The set is smaller than I imagined from the picture, somewhat disappointed although it is what it said it was."
3.0,The item did not fit as expected. Too small. I was happy with the quality of these slippers. I am returning and will most likely purchase a larger size.
3.0,My wife gave the thumbs down.  Material isn't comfortable.  Sticking with soma even though the cost a lot more.
3.0,The body is baggy but arms are tight! I'm a size 10 and ordered a large. It looks just like the photo. Also the shirt has zero give or stretch.
3.0,The graphic is very sharp. The sizes run VERY small. I’m between an XL and XXL usually so I bought the 2XL/3XL and it was too small.
3.0,Fit as expected and looks good. Three stars due to it is missing the belt
3.0,Super cute skirt but order a size bigger. I am 5'6 and weigh 118 and the skirt is way to small in the waist. Even if I pulled it up to my belly button it was too snug and then too short.
3.0,Really like the cut of this bra too bad that it is very small. I'm a size b cup and I'm falling out under and over 🤣
3.0,"Very cute! My teenagers loves this musical. Only reason for 3 stars is that the diary charm has diary spelled wrong! It says ""dialy""."
3.0,Zipper already broke after one wear. They are pretty tight even after measuring myself.
3.0,Outfit was cute..nice quality just wish the pants where draw string because they where tight in the thigh area but wheb it came to the waist it keep falling down which was annoying...would of went a size down but then i feel like it wouldn't fit past my thighs
3.0,"It's a fine product, not quite what I expected, so I expect to return.  I was looking for something lighter, it is double layered (up to you if that's what you want, the double layer made it heavier for my purposes).  Also, I should have checked the length, but it's shorter than it might appear in photos."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:3fe6dfdf082f53c7e937b19a88c576f2]] The colors are not as described.  I ordered this blouse in the color pink, but the true color is more of a peach. I returned it because I really wanted a pink blouse, other than that it's a really nice fit and I love the feel of the fabric."
3.0,Very pretty but one of the two large stone was not set properly and it's very noticeable.
3.0,This band is nice and light to wear however it hasn’t held up well over time. The finish has worn off in places and the magnet slips.
3.0,My child wanted to be some anime character for Halloween and we bought this because it was a required element for the costume. I’m hoping people don’t think she’s into BDSM and just think she’s being responsible during a pandemic and planned her costume for a mask. God help us. 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
3.0,"Super small heart. I would not call it a pendant if it is a size of a charm. Other than misleading dimensions, it is a nice looking charm. Fast delivery and free returns!"
3.0,Very soft and worth more than  what it cost. have not worn it yet so don't know how it will hold up in the wash.
3.0,"I imagined these pants to be more of a linen material, but they were much thinner and fit differently than I expected. They could be cute over a bathing suit, but way too thin to wear alone and were not as flattering as I thought they would be."
3.0,"Doesn’t quit resemble Hanma’s actual earrings, and in general they look cheaply built .<br /><br />Seller has. A bunch of other earrings up for sale I suggest you ship those before this pair"
3.0,"It may be my computer, but the pink is more like a ruddy dark orangish/pink coral. If the color was more light pink as pictured I would love this top."
3.0,Nice shirt but definitely order size up
3.0,"Honestly, I'd give it more like 3.5 stars. I like it, though the pattern is more dalmatian than I would have expected. I don't really like the sleeves. I feel like they're bulky and make me look a little boxy. They should be either looser or tighter, instead of this in between shape. I do like the cut and fit of the rest of it though. I find myself tightening the waist a lot so it has more shape!"
3.0,I'm returning this because of how small it is. Not accurately sized at all.
3.0,"Cute necklace & one of the bracelets also cute! Other bracelet is just a flimsy,<br />all bent piece of vinyl...<br />Earrings don’t match necklace at all!"
3.0,Decent quality for the price but awkward sizing. Even with the adjustable back i was unable to get tight around the stomach.
3.0,Boots are at least 1 size larger than they are marked
3.0,Bonito modelo
3.0,"Not the best quality, but super cute for occasional wear. When I wore them with my Crocs they slid off my foot."
3.0,"Its alright, But very drying to your ears.  Took these with me to Florida, and could only wear one pair because the black ones were the only ones that don't stick to my ears"
3.0,these belts function very well but look cheap as is the cost
3.0,the necklace was broken upon receiving the Item I'm so disappointed I was going to give my friend this as a present. I won't be able to get a replacement chain in time sigh. the Pendant is beautiful though  DX
3.0,Definitely spacious enough. The material is soft and comfortable.
3.0,I had to repair this cuff link. It came apart after wearing them a couple of times.
3.0,Shirt part fit ok but the high vis part does not stretch with rest of shirt
3.0,The clip is too big and blocks the vision
3.0,Way bigger than anticipated.  Cute dress though!
3.0,"otherwise, I loved the color."
3.0,"Thought it would be longer, but hubby likes it!"
3.0,This bag is definitely a Tote. Could be used to carry Laptop or use as school bag. Has zipper closer on top but inside is like a big black hole. Absolutely no zippered or open pockets to separate my things. I had to purchase an Organizer bag to put inside it so I can find anything.
3.0,"The saying is funny but when I put the shirt on, it fits in the sense that it is a large shirt. The only issue I have is that it is far too short. If you raise your arms, its coming up over your stomach. I guess not a bad thing if you don't mind showing it off but I like to be decent so it's weird not having a full range of motion since it will come up. Other than that, the shirt is great."
3.0,very cute and is going to make a great Christmas gift
3.0,"These shoes are good quality, but they are difficult to get on my kids feet. The size is right, but we always have trouble getting his heel to slide in there."
3.0,Very nice but a much paler stone than pictured
3.0,They look nice but they squeeze my head.
3.0,"The packaging of the item is vey nice, a gift level quality packaging.  The three pocket squares are folded nicely and are in their own plastic bag at the bottom of the small box.  They are a nice lightweight material which is nice, black, silver and white as described.  The pocket square holder was in its own plastic bag on top of the pocket squares all inside the box.  I like the idea of the pocket square holder since pocket square tend to slip or lose their shape over the course of the day.  The only issue with this one is that the opening to put the pocket square into is fairly small and can not handle thicker pocket squares that well.  The pocket square holder is thin enough that it does not add bulk to the pocket, but it isn't tall enough on its own without making more of the pocket square stick out of it to be visible from the pocket.  Everything is a good quality, it just isn't that easy to use with thicker pocket squares. I wanted something that worked with all of my pocket squares."
3.0,First I would like to say the the dress is very pretty but unfortunately I’m not gonna be able to wear it to my sisters wedding and the color was a little off too
3.0,Nose piece is a little uncomfortable
3.0,"Nice bag, But my new 13 inch lap top barely fits, corner exposed! that was the reason I bought it."
3.0,The leggings are very soft and stretch. The problem is that you can see through them in the thigh area.
3.0,The fit was fine all though the band looks stretchy it doesn’t have much give. I am a 8/10 in pants and a 6/8 in tops and the med was fine. Length is great very conservative cut. The sowing is not the best so some of the little ruffles bits not completely sown on but it’s not noticeable and you could fix or leave. It’s not that big a deal.
3.0,"This product is almost perfect, but the edges snag on fabric. Looking for a replacement that doesn’t. It’s good, but it could be better."
3.0,I could not see the writing on the clasp
3.0,"Not bad, but you can do better. Quality is marginal."
3.0,"It is OK, but would more for a adolescent to wear, in my opinion."
3.0,"These slipper socks are huge, my grand daughter wear a 7 shoe size she s 2 years old and they fell off her feet when walking in them!"
3.0,Nice dress but too small. Returned it.
3.0,Charm fell off too soon
3.0,The fabric is great for running and working out. Lose so it doesn't cling to your legs.
3.0,Was not very happy with the fit :(
3.0,Dress was full of thread pcs. from sewing machine.... No time taken to just clean it up before folding & shipping?  Not a quality cotton fabric AT ALL! ...
3.0,"I enjoy cool, lightweight fabrics. This felt cool but a bit scratchy on the outside, soft on the inside as tho it was theater material. The type of fabric that gets caught on dry skin. After a wash it seemed a little better.  The flow of the skirt is as shown. The skirt is a bit heavier than I expected but that seems to be all the fabric that helps it flow so nicely. Comfortable to wear."
3.0,Liked the glasses but then one day last week I went to put them on ... and the left stem snapped. Tried fixing but no success. ☹
3.0,"This boot is not anti slip. We purchased this boot because it states anti slip and water proof. We had a lot of snow, rain and ice in Minnesota, this boot did ok. Water did not get into the boot, my husband wore two pairs of socks in the boot so his feet were warm. The main issue is the boot is NOT anti slip."
3.0,"These are buttery soft and the waistband is great. There's a lot to love about them but the inseam is WAY off. 5"" is what I needed, 8.5"" is what I got."
3.0,Love the size of the bag.  Do not love the VERY large and VERY BRIGHT goldtone zippers.  Less flashy zippers would have the made the bag a 5 star.
3.0,"Bought this for my Granddaughter's Holy Communion. The Rosary was pretty, but it was broken when it arrived. Had to fix it with long nose pliers."
3.0,Cute necklaces for the price
3.0,"Looks very cute, but the sizes do run small so it didn't fit. I recommend a size or two up. It does come with an extender."
3.0,"Meh. They're not as big as I wanted, and they protrude a lot more than I expected. But for the price they're very shiny... don't expect them to last forever"
3.0,Panties are different sizes...
3.0,Gloves a great just took forever to get here
3.0,Very basic.
3.0,"They are a little tight, i can still wear them but they arent as comfy as i would like, maybe they will break in"
3.0,"Waist is made large, while legs are tight as they should be; therefore you ends with the waist rolling down and you have to continue to pull them up."
3.0,Nice bag but too small. I returned it.
3.0,I love the pendant it looks nice to me it might be plastic but that does not bother me at all stil looks good. Reason I'm giving it 3 stars is I've been waiting on it a lotttttt longer than expected took about 2 months to receive
3.0,They feel really bulky and are not very comfortable.
3.0,I usually wear a 14 but ordered an xxl. It fit perfectly except it was too long.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, useable once you get them open, but poor quality."
3.0,The ring came on time however it did not come looking as the ring in the picture looked. There is no brick like design
3.0,UNDERLINING MUST BE BLACK.
3.0,"I am 5'4, 130lbs & these are way too long and run very big. I normally wear a Large & bought these in a medium & they were still very loose & way too long. Otherwise super cute & soft but I will need them hemmed big time. Even with them up past my belly button. I get I am short but..."
3.0,"The image is a little off center and I have to agree with others that it is false advertising that the description states ""you choose the lettering"". With that said, you get what you pay for and it is very cute."
3.0,The material looked cheap so I returned it.
3.0,In comparison to the black color lift shirt this shirt was subpar. If I were to recommend this so someone I would go a size up and black shirt in color looks way better and the fabric feels better to the touch.
3.0,Not a pack of 6 as the description says. It's a pack of 3. I trusted the description and not the picture. Also they came and are easily a full size larger than my daughters other undies of the same size.
3.0,Cute shirt but ruff fabric and runs a tad on the small side. I’m a xl got a 2xl and it fit but more fitted and kinda short in length.
3.0,It looks good. Feels OK on the arm. It falls off when you’re carrying stuff.
3.0,I like the length of this piece and the vibrancy of the rose. However that vibrancy quickly fades if you neglect to remove it when you shower. Showering with the belly ring in will make the rose turn a faint rose gold color within a month. After that it looks dingy and cheap.
3.0,This has no logo in the inside of the shoe but I still like it cause of the design
3.0,"REVISED AFTER FIRST TIME WEARING: The pants are even more see through when you actually work out in them, would not suggest wearing them unless you have a shirt to cover your butt or a jacket to tie around your waist like I did. I have many pairs of colored leggings but none of them show sweat like these do.<br /><br />REVIEW PRE-WEAR: Based on the reviews, I decided to give these leggings a shot during a 60% off promotion. They’re very true to size, I wear a 6/8 pants so I got a Medium & they fit great, definitely won’t fall down while running or doing other cardio! But, they are definitely not opaque!<br /><br />I got the Peacock Blue & Magenta Haze, expecting the blue to be more transparent but the purple were actually worse! Not sure if the reviews stating that they’re fully opaque are from people who purchased a larger size than what they’d regularly wear or what, but if I went up in size I’d be swimming in the leggings.<br /><br />Overall, I would not suggest doing a leg day or any movements in which you have to bend over. But for cardio they will be wonderful as they fit well & the material won’t pill with heavy activity/movement."
3.0,"I got the size small.  Pants fit great but I'm a very small person at 5’2, 97lbs and an A chest and the top was unusually snug and tight in armpit area.  😕"
3.0,Cute hat does not breath and has not held up well through one season of softball
3.0,"It is a beautiful dress, but it does not look good on my body type so I returned it. I also thought it was a little short for a maxi (I’m 5’6”) But it is well made and the colors are very pretty in person."
3.0,"Nice boots but but three of the four buttons fell off, the first day she wore them. We were shocked. I was with her all day so I know she wasn’t ripping them off. We were out shopping, she was walking around and they kept falling off. I typically buy Uggs in this style but my daughter liked these so I thought we’d try Bear Paw brand. Everything else is fine but I have to sew the buttons back on. Not something I should need to do after only being worn once."
3.0,The item doesn't look like you're going to picture it looks colder more fake gold it does not look nothing like the picture it looks like like a steak when you receive it and it does not look the same as the picture it cheaper so I was not satisfied and I'm always ordering from Amazon and they are really really messing up big time
3.0,"You are going to have to iron these. However, they look really nice on."
3.0,Like the previous order than this one. Previous were Red and Blue
3.0,"Like the material and shape of this dress,but too tight for my size 16/18 body. Not a fan of pattern too.Returning."
3.0,Perfect gift for my niece!
3.0,Cup size too big
3.0,"The crowns were very beautiful but VERY heavy. No combs built in. Just two holes on the sides of the crown. They sent 6 Bobby pins which I couldn't understand why. I didn't have any other use for these, only the pictures."
3.0,I have a large head so they’re slightly uncomfortable. They’re incredibly cute though! I’ve only worn the brown pair a handful of times and the screws are coming loose. They’re decent enough.
3.0,color fades.Otherwise a good product
3.0,Could not fit me well.
3.0,"I actually went up a size as another reviewer said it runs small, plus it is pretty see through.  I can not wear it as a dress, I will use it as a caver-up for the pool."
3.0,Picture appears it is built to carry a shape. In reality it's like putting a pillow case on and hoping the wind blows right
3.0,"The clip ons don't wrap around my  prescription glasses.  Thus create blurry spots.<br />suggest instead a clip on, use prongs to secure."
3.0,I felt like I had gone back in time to the 70s when polyester was all the rage.  Too bad.  The cut and design overall was very nice.  too bad the material wasn't something more natural.
3.0,"Heavy, stiff fabric, a bit large, but a pretty shape."
3.0,This sweater looks cute but the quality isn’t what I expected. It looks a lot thicker in the photos. I got a size small and I would say it fits true to size
3.0,ok fit
3.0,"Fit as expected - 37,32, 43 sized medium.<br /><br />Material is okay, not too thin but not thick enough like a previous dress I order from a different vendor. For the price I was expected a bit more quality. The only con was the fact that the slit was entirely too high for me considering it was for work. Sitting down was uncomfortable especially since I have both hips and thighs. Luckily, I had a super long matching cardigan.<br /><br />Overall the dress is nice and I got compliments throughout the day."
3.0,Nice but smaller than expected. Product took too long to arrive.
3.0,The hipnotic effects of the shirt was not as pronounced as I thought it would be.<br />Wish it also were a little looser in the fit for the size I ordered.
3.0,"The whole key to whether these will work for you or not depends entirely on how you use them. The reason I say this, is the location of the zipper pocket in the middle back of the shorts. When doing any workout exercises that have you lying on your back...you will not be happy...that zipper really digs into the area above your butt and it isn't comfortable...doing sit ups can be downright painful.<br /><br />However, if you use them for running or other sports activities where you'll be staying vertical, you'll really like these. They fit well and are comfortable...as long as you're not putting any pressure on that zipper, which really wasn't a bad idea...they just never used/tested the shorts to see how they worked under all conditions.<br /><br />Going to the gym...working on the mats...on your back?? Find something else. For any other use, they are fine."
3.0,What measurement is CHN?
3.0,"They way they fit, feel funny."
3.0,"It's ok. Cute colors,  but I just feel kind of blah in the dress. I got size small, and find it kind of baggy,  and loose in the arms.  I wasn't looking for anything super tight as I'm 2 months postpartum,  but think it looks a bit too loose. I'm 5'4&#34;, 135 lbs."
3.0,The mask is fine for general use but in the tome of covid the holes within the fabric seem to large to be effective in preventing coughs/ sneezes from escaping
3.0,"its fairly shiny, its a good fit, nice quality for the price. Its Stainless steel so no bad skin reactions or anything ; overall a nice product but smaller than expected."
3.0,"Do not care for flare of skirt. Kept riding up as walking. Now that washed and dried, the hem has folded up"
3.0,They do their job but I look a little ridiculous wearing these. The color faded quickly and these don’t do well in the washer. After a few washes they are fairly faded. Plus the hairpiece moves if I’m removing my glasses and the fit is a little awkward.
3.0,"It's very pretty and I received tons of compliments the three times I wore it.  When taking it off that last time, I noticed it had changed color (tarnished a bit).  I'm disappointed.  Now I have to search for another one."
3.0,It was very big and not what I expected but I will definitely use it and make it work.
3.0,Beautiful pendant but chain was a tangled mess...will need to find another chain.
3.0,"I purchased this hat for my 10 month old son, and the tag is huge on the inside of the hat even though I carefully cut it with scissors removing the tag it began to unravel leaving a hole in the side of that I guess you get what you pay for cheap hat cheaply made"
3.0,"Too small, too cheap. Very disappointed"
3.0,Not what I expected. I don't like the material at all. Not warm at all. Very cold. But it looks like the picture so not a total loss.
3.0,Wasn't as flowy as I believed it would look like in the picture But it is tight fitting
3.0,I bought these for work (hospital) but have only worn them twice because they aren’t comfortable. Unfortunately they aren’t long enough to hook behind my ears so they dig in and I end up having to switch to another pair halfway through my shift.
3.0,Leotard has cute pattern but it is a baggy fit.
3.0,Way too large and I bought the small. Cute concept.
3.0,"I dress is actually pretty, true to size and color is right however, it is a see through dress.  You have to make sure to wear something underneath otherwise, it's not pretty.  I had to return it."
3.0,"I have the white with black flowers. It fits well (as expected) however I'm 5'4"" and I'm going to have to hem it because it is too long for my taste (mid-calf). I'm also going to have to add lining because it's transparent. Though I can sew, it's unnecessary time put into a piece that should've been done. Will not buy again."
3.0,This dress is cute and gives me lots of Beth dalton vibes from Yellowstone. I’m pretty flat chested (34B) so this fit me ok in the chest but I got a large and the area under the breast is really tight for some reason. I usually wear a medium and glad I went with a large bc I can still wear this dress.
3.0,impossible to close correctly!!!
3.0,Good for a couple weeks but tarnishes after showering for awhile.
3.0,"I ordered this for my husband as we went to an event. However, it had no buttons on sleeves and the cuff links to close the shirt all broke off so I sewed buttons on and he will use it for upcoming wedding."
3.0,If you have a large bust this will stretch on top and be see through. Unfortunate for a cute dress.
3.0,"The gem is great, the necklace is way to thin."
3.0,Nice compression pressure but difficult  to put on. Needs better elasticity.
3.0,Itchy nylon lace.
3.0,Nice soft shirt BUT extremely see threw so you have to wear something under it which kind of makes this useless on a hot day!
3.0,Was way bigger than the size should be
3.0,"They are cute and may be perfect for little babies but for bigger babies or babies with chubby tights, they are way too tight and not comfortable :/"
3.0,They're huge! They pulled my earlobe down uncomfortably and rested on my shoulders. Plus a gem was broken off when they arrived. They would have been awesome if they were scaled down about 60%. Other than that they're very pretty.
3.0,This dress is adorable but was very short. I ended up keeping it and using it as a top paired with some yellow shorts. It was way to short as a dress.
3.0,The fabric/quality was good. Overall length and fit was good. The shoulders for some reason was extremely narrow so I returned for that reason.
3.0,They look good. Nice size.
3.0,"First off, I ordered the green coat in XL. I am 5'6&#34; and 135lbs and usually wear a M and sometimes L in American sizes. There are aspects of the coat I really liked but there were more things I disliked. I couldn't justify keeping it for what I paid and so I am returning it. Here are the pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS<br />-I love how versatile this is...who doesn't like having items that can be worn three different ways!<br />-I really like the hue of the coat. It's definitely an olive green.<br />-When I look at the coat on its own, I think it looks very cute and stylish. The problems started when I tried it on.<br />-I like that you can zip the fur layer in and out and the fur hood buttons to the shell.<br /><br />CONS<br />-The arms were very short for me. An ideal sleeve length for me is 20-21&#34;. The sleeves on the shell measured 17&#34; and the lining was 15.4&#34;.<br />-The body of the jacket fit very nicely but I have a big bust for my size (32 DDD) and because of this, the bulk of the positioning of the fur, the two large buttoned pockets in the front and then with it belted made me look much bigger than I am. My husband agreed that it made me look at least 10lbs heavier.<br />-The coat appeared to be for cold weather but though the fur is very cozy, the arms are quite thin. I live in Minnesota and need a coat that is a little better equipped for sub zero temperatures. This would be good in for temps in the 30-40 degree Fahrenheit range.<br />-The material was much shinier than I expected. It's hard to tell from my picture but it's not a matte finish like I had expected.<br />-The fur is very different than the advertised pictures. I don't hate it but it's very striped and has a very &#34;red fox&#34; hue.<br />-The flap on the right shoulder of the coat is something I didn't expect and I wasn't really a fan of it."
3.0,They are cute for how much you are paying for them.
3.0,"I received these today at work and immediately put them on. I wore them for about 3 hours total. I don't do alot of walking at work, mostly a desk job I have to say these socks are comfortable and feel soft. The compression seems good not too tight  My only complaint is that these socks come up a little shorter than my knee so they sit right at my calf. I noticed towards the end of my day they started to slip, I wish they were made a little longer and I wonder if they will shrink when I wash them. If I can remember I will update this review after I wash them :-)"
3.0,Very small but cute. Just the right size to go above a bigger earring.
3.0,Loved the style and look overall! But the fabric for the bottoms is pretty thin and could see my cami.. definitely needed to return because I’m Not going out in public with that. I got a different printed one and that one works great. It’s just the lighter solid colors that show.. everything…
3.0,Cap and earplugs are fine...but goggles fot is not good.somehow water enters inside of u r swimming underwater.
3.0,Work pants. Good fit.
3.0,Don't plan on lifting your arms above your bust line... This top is beautiful as long as you don't plan on lifting your arms much it rides up over your bust. If your moving around a lot you will be constantly  pulling it back down into place. But it is beautiful  other wise.
3.0,"Overall it provides great sun protection, fashion and if it actually came the size it says it was I would have kept it. Also important to note there are fairly firm fo am pads that are thicker than you might expect and sit way out to the sides. They don't actually go where they should?"
3.0,Ok. Very thin.
3.0,"sent back was way to large , more a mans watch than a ladies watch"
3.0,Clip was in field of vision. Lenses did not wrap around far enough to keep wind out.
3.0,"Kept my hands very warm and git well, but the touchscreen pads were useless.  Had to remove my gloves to use my phone.  Recommend them only to keep warm."
3.0,"I wear mine unless charging or showering. It has broken on both sides of the watch from just normal wear... I really loved this band too, but I can't keep buying a ton of straps. I would rather get quality over quantity. Honestly a bit disappointed. I hate leaving bad reviews."
3.0,"Beautiful suit, exactly as pictured. I’m 5’2’’ 135lb and the medium fit everywhere but my 34Ds! The cups would probably fit a C or smaller."
3.0,"These stretch to fit your feet.  I am a size 7 and I fit fine into the Small; if I had gone with a larger size, I would have a hard time keeping them on my feet.  These are just &#34;okay&#34;.  I have worn a pair for one day and already had to sew up a hole.  For the price, these are nice to wear around the house instead of socks.  I was looking for house slippers that were more than socks, but not necessarily shoes.  These are perfect for that.  However, next time I will shell out more money for better quality."
3.0,Alas this fabric to thin to wear without underwear 🙈
3.0,Nice flip up sunglasses just a little tricky to slip over glasses.
3.0,Seems to be a good product but the tools sent are with are junk. The screwdriver stripped the head with one screwdriver. Had to go buy another screwdriver.
3.0,"Had to return, did not fit around wrist."
3.0,Maybe I didn’t read the description but it’s for kids not for adults
3.0,"The top runs really small, but is very cute.  I bought a small for my niece who wears mostly girls size 16 clothes and this was too small for her."
3.0,"Three stars because they returned my money back to me. The reasons why I returned, 1. this jacket easily attracts dust and any light weight materials when in contact. 2. The belly area puff up when I zipped the zipper up. 3. It is too big. The good side of this jacket, 1. The zippers are in very good quality. 2. it keeps you warm in indoor only."
3.0,The fit is not good and may be due to the side attachment. I cannot figure out how it works.
3.0,"It fits ok, but the cups are too close together so, instead of pushing up, they kind of flattened my chest because they didn’t fit properly."
3.0,too large. sticks out too far
3.0,Very pretty dress but runs small. Need to size up at least 1 size up
3.0,"I bought these and loved them and got so many compliments on them however after a few times of wearing them on one of the pairs, the mirrored coating began to wear away and it was right in the center of my vision, which was a bummer, especially after only wearing them a few times. I'm not sure if water or something caused this because it's not a scratch. The nose pieces also get caught in your hair very easily if you put them on the top of your head and can rip out a lot of hair very easily."
3.0,The sunglasses are ok...kind of flimsy. Not a big loss if they break or get scratch.
3.0,Runs small. Very cute shoe
3.0,"Cool looking shirt,too bad it's a slim fit & doesn't mention that in the discretion."
3.0,Loved the fabric and the shirt. My husband wears a 2xl and the sleeves were and body of the shirt were too short.  So disappointing and haven't found another like it.
3.0,"I ordered my normal size and itbwas eat to big. Also, I bought the pink and good lord it was a super bright neon pink. Not for me. Returning!"
3.0,Quick tie not for a Jr in high school who wears all shades of blue ties - this one didn't hold up compared to my good will finds!  For way less and with a name!
3.0,"Very wide legs, but waist way too small though I ordered a large. I wear size 8 jeans."
3.0,Shorter than expected. I'm short and still need to wear something under.
3.0,Not as thick as I thought it would be. I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"The quality is amazing, just runs small. The arms were too tight and was difficult for my son to wear after swimming bc he was wet plus the arma were tight.<br />Order 2 size up and will be big on your kid but he can grow into that piece for a while."
3.0,"Meh it’s okay, don’t wash it in your washer because it will come apart, cheap quality but cute. Not for newborns, maybe when they are like 8 months"
3.0,"These are decent leggings. The print was much subtler than the pictures indicate. Fabric is soft but thin, not a lot of compression, so not entirely flattering. The fabric is also almost shiny and slick, to where it feels slippery and can ride up. Very short, which was surprising, unless I missed in the description that they are ankle or 7/8 leggings. They are not see through, and pass the squat test. I'm 5'3"", 145 and the medium fits as expected.<br /><br />They are not bad leggings, I just would not buy them again when there are better ones to be had. If you're on a budget and aren't planning to wear them for exercising, you should be fine."
3.0,Needs starch to firm up.
3.0,Shipping on this item is a little high and when we got the glove there was a defect and we just wanted it replaced. Seller asked us to send glove back and he would replace. Felt like we already spent too much (shipping) on the glove and decided to have it repaired ourselves (by mom). This is the best looking MJ glove we have seen just would have appreciated better customer service. Would consider buying again.
3.0,"Purchased for a wedding I was in but had to return because I ended up just using something I already had. Earrings were okay, can't really expect much since I didn't pay a whole lot for them. Everything was intact no missing stones or anything and it got to me pretty quickly."
3.0,okay......
3.0,I order these socks for my dad due to swelling in his right foot. But they are to tight for his leg. I'm going to give them to my nephew who plays football and soccer.  They will come in handy.
3.0,These are nice jeans but they fit way too small. I don’t remember what size I got but I’m 6’1 and I weigh 170lbs.
3.0,I do not like the fit around the lower jaw. It is much too roomy for a lot of adults with smaller faces and does not come in sizes. I had to make tucks in the fabric to get it to fit without gaps. It is just OK.
3.0,"Not super impressed with these cloth diapers. I used cloth diapers as spit up rags for my twins. I love the old 9 ply white cloth diapers that you can get in bulk for pennies, but being Burts Beez we wanted to try these out. They didn't hold much of anything. You might as well should have a paper towel! Not sure what they're expecting these to be used for. I wasn't impressed...especially for the price!"
3.0,"I love the MedCouture Gold scrubs and own about 6 pair. I ordered the same size I always get and the top was way too small. I've had this happen previously with the grey set as well. The quality of the scrubs are great as always, but they need to get way more consistent with there sizing."
3.0,"Gave it 3 stars because its too short , barely made around my neck"
3.0,"Disappointed because when taken out of plastic package the logo was not printed on the shirt, it’s iron on sticker,  two letters were stuck together. I guess it happened when shirt was folded to package. Also you have to hand wash if you want it to stay intact"
3.0,set was not what I expected.  Somewhat short and heavy - could have done better locally at the Flea Market or mall
3.0,"I have the Woolly Clothing Cropped Pullover Hoodie in the Slate color. It’s gorgeous! It’s a bluey gray that really does bring to mind slate blue.<br /><br />The hoodie has a pocket on the front. Like a pocket tee. Not a kangaroo pocket. The description says “Front pouch pocket for no fuss extra storage” but that is not accurate. I actually didn’t realize there was a pocket on the upper chest -- the pictures don’t show that detail very well.<br /><br />The hood drawstrings are raw, just tied in a knot. No aglets. For a sweatshirt this expensive, I’d prefer a nicer finish on the drawstrings.<br /><br />The cropped bottom hits right at my hipbone, so it’s not a super short sweatshirt. It does look very cute with a pair of high-waisted leggings or pants.<br /><br />The sizing is true to size, Woolly Clothing has a better size chart on their website.<br /><br />The hoodie itself is medium weight, so it’s warm but not overly bulky. It will be great for fall temperatures. The wool is soft not scratchy, and is machine washable. The care instructions are printed on the inside back of the hoodie, machine wash cold with like colors, inside out. The hoodie has no tags at all."
3.0,This is a perfectly made garment. Alittle lighter fabric then I would have liked. Not enough larger sized items though  I am seen by about 100 people a day and they always ask about my tops and earrings. Thank u for ur efforts  J
3.0,"Though we are Tilley lovers, I must admit that these did not dry as quickly as the competition. Buy the JT Fields product if you really want them to be dry in the morning."
3.0,"Not for big breasted women!! Def only covers the nips on a C cup. Material was pretty tight after order a size up. Had to give it to a friend with lower cup size. Really cute, wish it had more coverage."
3.0,Nice not American size. Will need to order 1-2 sizes bigger
3.0,"This is a great glasses case.  The hinge could take your finger off when it closes, keeping your glasses securely intact during transport.  The colors are exceptional and vibrant and the case it tough as nails.  I would give this five stars but...<br /><br />the inside of the case is falling out of the outer shell.  It appears they should be form fitted together, but mine is starting to pull away from the sides.  Disheartening that such a small thing renders a great product semi-useless."
3.0,"My Mother-In-Law loves the Twilight series and got this for her as a stocking stuffer.  It's a cute piece of costume jewelry, but the quality of construction is not something that would lend itself to being worn everyday."
3.0,This was cute. A little cheap looking but not bad. I got lots of compliments. Make sure to handwash!
3.0,two of them tore the first time I wore them
3.0,"I really like the flexibility in the legs and seat. However, the waist is not flexible; the place where it’s needed the most. I will likely be returning these."
3.0,"Its a nice enough pack. It does NOT have a hip belt, and where the straps attach to the bottom is not low enough to add a hip belt on your own.<br />The shoulder straps are NOT very well padded. So basically you cannot do any serious packing with this backpack, which is a bummer because it is quite large and stores everything quite well, seems to hold up to being stuffed full. I guess its ok for a light weight pack. Don't plan on doing more than like 3-5 miles a day with it."
3.0,"The medium fits to size and seems to fit even over light weight sweaters easily. It's collarless and no button closure. The back and waist taper nicely inward. the seams on the back and waist are done very well. Despite the fit, I really didn't like the material. It's kind of a rough lined material that reminds me of the blankets that airlines used to give to its sleeping passengers. I'm also not too fond of the shoulder pads. It seems very old fashioned. Overall, it's ok for work purposes even if it seems really conservative."
3.0,I bought the largest size available and I'm 5'2&#34; 226lbs and 42D bra. I am very sad to say it didn't fit. It was very cute but just didn't fit well.
3.0,"Very cute. Had several compliments of how nice it was. If you are large chested order a size up. I am a AA, 145lbs., 5’5. Washes well in the washer on cold."
3.0,"I really like the material and fit of this dress. But the photo explains it all. The buttons from the top and bottom are not aligned AT ALL. I would recommend if that was fixed.<br /><br />UPDATE: the company mailed me a new dress and I received it within 3 days. The ned dress is perfect and I would recommend. The white in the bottom part of the dress is somewhat see through but that is expected. Make sure to wear skin tone underwear. The straps are adjustable which is great and there is a lot of stretch room in the breast area so bigger chested girls, I would not worry. I am 5'4"" and it hit my just under the knee so beware of length. Overall this product is great for the money, I recommend it."
3.0,"Can't really figure it out, put it on my son and he can't even see out of it...I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if it's too small..."
3.0,It is a lot smaller than I expected to be but I still like it. Also the necklace isn't as long as it showed in the picture.
3.0,"The print is lovely. Otherwise, cannot recommend for size 14 and up. I wore it for 45 minutes to a business tea, and came home and pitched it into the bottom of my closet in disgust.<br /><br />Even though it's advertised as a maxi, there is no way to get the trimmed A line silhouette as shown in the product images. The belt that comes with it is cheaply made and it looks it. The hem is uneven, which becomes very apparent when you try to wear it belted, contributing to the overall ill-fitting dumpy look it gave me. Generates lots of static, even after treating with static spray and dryer sheets."
3.0,Really gorgeous but broke pretty quickly
3.0,"5'2 125lbs ordered a small and they fit OK. They are really really long on me, which you can roll the waist up but then you look frumpy under your shirts. Kinda see thru in the sun, found out while wearing it (army green color) and someone said they could see my pantie color."
3.0,Look nice but no butt lifting effect at all. They actually make it look flatter. Little disappointed.
3.0,They would of been cute but they were way too big at the top around my ankle. Looked silly. I am returning
3.0,"I wanted to like this watch. In some ways I do. The band is comfortable but also branded in a really tacky way. The face looks nice until you try to read the smaller dial. It's so dark I can't make it out. It's sized right for my arm (I'm on the low side of average male size wise.)<br /><br />I love the app functions, which are step counting and sleep monitoring. I love that I don't have to put this watch on a charger every time I come home. I like that I can customize the function of each of the three buttons. The battery in the watch is a CR2430 Lithium Battery. A two pack of these in a well known brand name is about $3.50 so take into account that you will be spending that each year.<br /><br />I would give this watch five stars if the branding was more subdued and I could read the smaller dial.<br /><br />A watch FAQ lives here: http://www.armani.com/support.asp?tskay=FDB832CE"
3.0,"Sizing is off my daughter is 5yo and wears a size 11, and she may eventually fit these next year."
3.0,"I bought this bag in black. I cant believe the quality for the price! Mine was $8. Its got so much room! I love it! If you want a nice bag, grab it while you can!<br /><br />**EDIT**<br /><br />So Ive had this bag for a while now, and I felt the need to edit my original review from 5 stars to 3. Its a very pretty bag at first, but does not hold up well to every day use. I suppose you get what you pay for for $8, but I would not order this bag again."
3.0,"I bought these for my two year old who is always trying to steal my rings and refuses to wear the plastic costume jewelry. Pretty rings but very cheaply made, one broke right away from minimal pressure trying to adjust it to fit. Good for price but if you want something that’ll last, I’d spend a few more dollars on a nicer product"
3.0,I would have liked a smaller size but............it will work.
3.0,They're pretty and they work but one of the temples felt loose after just 1 day. I had to return them.
3.0,Look cheap irl. Because they are! Color of wood isn’t as nice as picture
3.0,dosn't stay on the ear
3.0,The description said it was a hard case but its not hard it maybe 'semi hard'  If you sit on it it will be crushed.  Its also really big.  I didn't expect it to be so big but I guess that is ok if you have big sunglasses.
3.0,"The material is not something I would trust with a lot of coins inside, but I get SO many compliments on this coin purse. Super cute and has held up so far!"
3.0,I like this dress but it is not a mini. Petite ladies beware.
3.0,Thin material.  My little one had difficulty with snap under the arm.  End up buying an umbrella  to keep in her book bag instead of this poncho
3.0,It didn't work like I thought it would I had to use a lot of to get the oil and water to mix well together.
3.0,"Not the best product out there, it shrunk on the first wash and the zipper got all bunched up which isn't the best look, i basically use it for it's utility now which isn't too bad but you'd probably be better served spending your cash on something else."
3.0,I got these for undershirts for my son.<br />The quality was okay.<br />They were a little see thru but served the purpose of what I wanted them for.
3.0,"The model makes it look cuter then it really is. It’s just an “ok” top. I wish I would have ordered a large. I thought it was going to be longer. It just falls barely past the waste band of my jeans. This is the 2nd top I’ve gotten from the same company and they both are the same fit. Keeping the tops because they aren’t horrible, I just expected better. Won’t order again."
3.0,"I gave it three stars because I expected it to be shorter like in the picture, I ordered a medium wish I’ve got a small instead. I’m slim built. Weight 135lb, but I got hips and ass.. Lol, The material is very stretchy as it is polyester and spandex. I’ll probably have to get it altered. No biggy tho, because I want it snug on me when I wear it LOL"
3.0,The swimsuit and I loved it
3.0,As soon as I put them on I heard threads start to break.
3.0,Great quality material however I was unable to get these leggings over my thighs the stretch is a zero
3.0,Full leg zipper but you need to jeans under them.
3.0,The fit is good.  Very relaxed.
3.0,Cute dress. Love the length.
3.0,"Flimsy fabric, cheesecloth-like.  Too much fabric for a gown, too flimsy to wear out."
3.0,"Very boxy fit.  Also smelled sort of weird - not bad, just weird - upon unwrapping it."
3.0,"These are very light-weight, and not bad but look a bit like costume jewelry...however they would work well to dress up a casual shirt or t-shirt or pearl accent with bluejeans. The clips are pretty study and the wires the faux pearls are mounted on are very flexible, so the hoops could be slightly bent to make them oblong if desired. The pearls are evenly colored but do not have a lot of luster or natural pearly sheen to them like real pearls do."
3.0,"Although there is give in the material, there is no give in the waist at all because of the stitching. Other than that it feels good and looks nice. Most probably will just give it away."
3.0,"I'm 5' 8&#34; 165lb with a 38 and half inch chest.<br />I bought the US Medium/Asia X Large option.<br /><br />The jacket is awesome, the material is top notch, and the jacket actually kept me warm in the low 50 degree (fahrenheit) temperature.<br /><br />However the draw back here is that the sizing is a bit wonky. The US Medium on me (38 1/2&#34; chest) was a bit tight and restricted any chance of potentially layering with a sweater.<br /><br />The sleeves were also shorter than I expected leaving about and inch to an inch and a half of wrist room which felt awkward.<br /><br />I had to return my jacket because of the awkwardness of the fit. But if I had to buy it again, I'd probably buy a size bigger (US Large/ Asia 3XL)."
3.0,"Very lightweight and comfy, but it was too short by a couple inches. I’m a size 10, 5’8” and I couldn’t bend over without my booty hanging out. Definitely seems like it was meant for shorter ladies."
3.0,"Even though this pin is tiny, the person I gave it to, loved it.  I had to get a gift card to go with it. It’s more of a stocking stuffer than a gift by itself."
3.0,"I had no intention of trying these goggles when I did, but I just couldn't wait for my vacation to test them and see how they performed.  I don't want to bring defective goggles on vacation, right?  My boy did not want to leave the pool after his swimming lesson, so we hung back and waited until their open swim session.  I had two different goggles to try out, so I immediately put these on.  I love that you can undo the back, especially as mine tend to snag and take a hair or two along for the ride.  Ouch.  I wanted the strap under my hair and that's really hard to do when you have to pull the strap over your head.  I snapped it in place and tried to make the proper adjustments.  You can't do it while the goggles are on (or at least I couldn't), so I had to take them off, try to adjust, and then put them back on to find it still needed more adjusting.  I found it hard to adjust the straps.  I got so used to my son's goggles (push a button and then pull the band to tighten or loosen).  These aren't that way and I struggled with the band.  I finally got it to where I thought I needed it.  There are no instructions or guide that comes with the goggles.  It's just the goggles, ear plugs, and a nose plug in a mesh bag.  I think they slipped some because they kept the water out in the beginning (I was very cautious for my first try) and then I noticed I was getting some water inside.  I readjusted the goggles on my face and it seemed to hold longer. I had rings around my eyes from having the goggles on for 20 minutes, so maybe I need to find that perfect fit still.<br /><br />I read one review that mentions being afraid the little clip in the back would suddenly unsnap and water could rush in.  I gotta say I also felt that way.  It's a thin plastic button that sorta slips into a little ring thing and then snaps.  I wear contacts and don't know that I would trust it to hold for a long period of time.  However I can't fault the goggles and am taking no star(s) away for this clip because it is intact and has held when worn. My rating is based on my personal experience with it and the difficulty I experienced adjusting it.  The UV protection is great and the goggles look good.  The mesh bag is kind of strange because every other pair of goggles I've purchased had a hard case.  This bag can be used to collect seashells or something, but I will have to find another travel case for the goggles.  I'll also work on getting the goggles adjusted right.<br /><br />Note: I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"If you want something casual yet form fitting... this isn't it. I'm 5ft, 120 Ilbs, curvy... I bought a small and was worried about it being  too short because of my butt, and clinging too tightly. not at all the case. so big in fact that I had no figure whatsoever. hung well beneath my knees and was just terribly unflattering."
3.0,I love wearing these. They are pretty and NO do not turn my ears green.:-) My only problem is that one of them turns in a bit-- the metal is a touch bent so I have to switch the sides they are worn on sometimes so it doesn't turn into my cheak and not be visable.
3.0,Cute shirt but fits way to small. I gave it to my daughter and she really likes it. I also ordered a very large size because of other reviews but it was still too small for me. (I'm not a big girl either)
3.0,"It's hard to take it out from nose . It kinda hurts and it keeps pushing on the skin. It doesn't fall out which it's great . It's great to use just for few hours . Good price , it arrived fast . No complains . Thanks"
3.0,"Shirt looked like expected. Soft material, however when I tried the shirt on I could tell it was short. I lifted my arms and it came above my belly button! Have to return unfortunately..."
3.0,"Love the sweater, super cute! Runs small, would definitely size up!"
3.0,"They look very nice, but there is no arch support.  [[ASIN:B00YJHRDLY DREAM PAIRS THERMO Women's Winter Fur Interior Zipper Closure Outdoor Snow Boots Grey Size 9]]"
3.0,"fabric isn't as soft as I had hoped, fit a little large."
3.0,"I’m average height 5,4’ and 140lbs. This shirt does not fit like the picture. It’s much smaller. No gathering or oversize look. I’m supposing you have to go at least two sizes bigger or more to get that look."
3.0,It's lovely but I am 5'2 and it's too long.<br />I truly wish it was shorter.
3.0,"I like the manufacturing of this product, the light weight and wood work with the colors, the frame is done nicely. The lenses are okay but the polarization is quite on the low side so for protection it is not as expected. I’ve tried sunglasses with perfect polarized lenses, this one failed to meet that satisfactory expectation."
3.0,Theses were beautiful for my cousins wedding.
3.0,The design is interesting but the quality isn't great and the cord is itchy.
3.0,I didn't love it.
3.0,"The body suit is a nice soft fabric and very stretchy.  l like it but here are a few complaints or things to consider before you buy. I am 5”6’ approximately 170pounds , 36d bra, size 12 pants, and hippy. I ordered a large thinking it would be a good fit, and its almost too big in certain areas. The torso is long. and this makes the fir a little looser than l expect in a body suit. I liken the fit to me having a  tshirt tucked in. That’s ok. But what really was kind of disappointing is that the v was more of a u. To be fair i am a little wider across the back and boobs are a D cup, but it wasn’t pulling or tight at all. Long story short I like the top and may order it again, but I don’t know if I should order up to get a true V-neck and then have lots of excess fabric in torso/snap area, or order down for a shorter torso and a not so deep cut U neck."
3.0,very cute dress but it seemed to run large.
3.0,Cute dress but fabric is very thin and shows every little bump or lump. I ended up returning it.
3.0,Fit well when first got it. Seems to habe shrunk slightly. Im short torso and thats how it shrunk. I like the shirts to dangle lower as in photo so that's a bit deceiving after a couple washes it wasnt dangling. Also it sort if clings to body and doesnt stay loose fit. It was cute though. Maybe id hand wash versus machine in hopes to keep it's look! Color was true to photo and delivery was quick hence the 3 stars.
3.0,"While the gown itself was nice in length and basic comfort, the decal on the front has proved to be picky and itchy inside against the skin."
3.0,"I do like the style of the bag.  I thought it would stay standing but found out it slouches.  It is still a great bag, but before I buy again I will make sure to ask some questions."
3.0,"These are ok, but don't allow your skin to breathe as I expected them to."
3.0,"I got these because masks I've been using were too small and this one comes in XL.  They fit fine and the material is comfortable, but they don't stop glasses from fogging, so I assume that they also don't stop viruses from spreading.<br /><br />I've has my shots, and these are probably no worse for protection than the ones I've been using for the last year. I'll be wearing these out in public mainly for appearances.<br /><br />I bought another brand of masks at the same time which were cheaper and came with a nose clip attached and filter pads for inside the masks. They fit about the same even though they only came in medium, but they are heavier and are a little bit harder to breathe in.  I got the filtered ones to use when spraying chemicals in the yard."
3.0,"Rubber came off in about a week, and that’s the reason I got these. Now they’re just a regular barbell."
3.0,it takes some getting used to...it does fit over my glasses but it is difficult to use since I have multi-focal lenses.  Would be great if I didn't have glasses or didn't have multi-focal lenses
3.0,Just to billowy around the hips for me.
3.0,"Item runs small, also short"
3.0,Bodice made well but skirt had way to much flare and didn't appear as advertised.
3.0,Love the knife but it doesn't stay into the Holder
3.0,Not the right size I expected
3.0,"I was under the impression that these pants had a pocket on the leg like some others I've seen of this exact brand.  The pocket on the leg version I've seen are deep and nice and on the outside of the pants, the hidden pocket on this one is in the stomach region on the inside of the pants and the pocket is shallow.  Otherwise the pants function just fine.  Bought these specifically to hold my iPhone while working out and they didn't serve the purpose I was needing so for that reason I give them a 3."
3.0,"It's not nearly as long and drapey on me as it is on the model, but I'm also 5'9 so finding longer tops can be an adventure. It'll be cute with jeans and boots or moccasins this fall and the quality is pretty good for the price."
3.0,"This is a nice dress style. Unfortunately its been made with a poor, cheap material.  The material is really dissapointing. Its nothing like the thick material shown in the picture. You may need to wear a slip under it.  I also accidentally ordered the wrong size but I can fix that."
3.0,"Bought this for my husband and it doesnt fit him.  It fit my 9 year old son perfectly.  In my opinion, this is not for an adult."
3.0,"I really like the frames on these glasses.  They are comfortable and stay on well (although I have not tried any strenuous activity while wearing them).  With the rectangular style folding glasses, I find myself constantly tiling my head up & down to get a good view through the lenses - I have no such issue with these round glasses.<br />However, the lenses on these are not true reading glass lenses - they are actually just traditional magnifying glass lenses.  This means they have a fixed focal point and are really only useful when trying to read something at that specific distance - too close or too far and text becomes blurrier than without the glasses."
3.0,"It's a conversation starter for sure, but it is heavy and bulky."
3.0,Shirt is a bit clingy and runs small.  Material was thinner than expected.
3.0,Pretty earrings. One style did not come with a matching earring.
3.0,It comes unscrewed easily and the black piece also comes off easily other than that it's a cute necklace
3.0,Cute shirt. Fit perfect and shipped quickly. Very thin material.
3.0,"The gloves are they advertised, half gloves. Unfortunately, I really needed 3/4 gloves that support my finger joints but leave the finger tips exposed."
3.0,"I purchased this for my daughter for her 6th grade dance & it was way to big.  It was too big for me also! It is very pretty though & is nicely priced, if you can get the right size!"
3.0,Fits very well very nice product I love it
3.0,Good material.  Fit nicely at the large sise
3.0,Liked the softness and quality. Colors slightly different on each slipper. And somewhat small for a ten
3.0,"I bought this to take to my summer internship. It looks very nice and I like that a lot; however, it is very heavy. too heavy. I only carry my 13 inch. laptop, my sandals, keys, snacks and it is super heavy to carry around."
3.0,"These are so cute, the cut is irregular. Which makes the fit a little off, but they are cute enough to go through the  little discomfort  and of course they stretched out after wear."
3.0,not suited for people with muscles on their calfs! Meant for pitete women or children
3.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This dress is made of very pretty lightweight fabric with lovely blue and white color.  I like the slits on the sides - they allow for ease of movement.  The dress has an inner lining but it ends partway down the legs.  I am 5'5"", 152 lbs and typically wear a size medium or 10 in dresses.  This dress fits well everywhere except it is too tight along the bustline.  The buttons pop open and the snap meant to keep the spaces between the buttons from opening doesn't work.  I also don't like how the waistline is right below my boobs.  It looks a little odd and unflattering."
3.0,These are cool but I have an iPhone X and it heavy so it pulls on my neck
3.0,Worth trying. Doesn't stop v2skl and microwave or rf but worth trying
3.0,"Thick, warm and comforable for a bit but lacking in stretch so they can't be warn for long."
3.0,"these are HUGE! They come clear up to my hip and still a lot of material left to look like elephant legs! So sad, I love the color and feel of the fabric."
3.0,lenses are narrow top to bottom which leaves a larger gap than I prefer between bottom of lens and cheek.
3.0,"It fit as expected and is great for the price,and the colour is fantastic.<br /><br />I just hope that the stiffness calms down with a wash. The petticoat stands up when I'm not wearing it.<br /><br />Also one downside is that there is a slip underneath the layers of petticoat, which has no stretch at all. So if you're walking or dancing and you kick your leg out, you get a hard stop."
3.0,"They’re cheap. I was looking for red mirror glasses and these fit what I want! However, there are many bubbles on the lens. A few large ones I was able to capture on my phone. I’m really disappointed. There are spots and bubbles throughout."
3.0,Loved shirt just already had one
3.0,I ordered an XLarge which I am bigger on top which it fit ok (a little loose) but around the waist and the legs it runs big. The material is ok not the best fitting bathing suit.  I hope this helps.
3.0,"I bought this headband for my baby to wear at a Great Gatsby themed wedding. It was adorable. My only complaint is it was completely flat so I had to tape it around a food canister to get it to curve around my baby's head, and even after two days like that it was just barely curved."
3.0,Nice but fit is horrible.
3.0,the pants fit bigger the onsie fits as expected. the shirt is more of a tan color then white and the wording it’s faded but it is what it is<br />picture is on my 13lb 5 month old
3.0,You pay for what you get !nothing more !
3.0,"I think the sizing on this dress is messed up. I see people leaving reviews stating the dress was multiple sizes too small. I ordered an XS based on a photo and similar size comparison review someone had left. I was worried the dress was going to be too small. I always wear an XS or 00 in womens clothes because I am petite (I try to stick to shopping in the Jr's section) and this dress fits me like a women's medium or even large. I didn't want the hassle or returning so I decided to fix it with my sewing machine. I sewed it down to my size but because the fabric is not stretchy, it's difficult to get on and off. Even after sewing to my size, the dress just isn't that flattering on me and I probably won't wear it a whole lot so it was kind of a waste of money for me. Other than that, the dress itself is a nice quality, soft and lighter cotton fabric. It really is a beautiful piece but definitely not for everyone and may be tricky to land your correct size."
3.0,Fits well and is comfortable but the picture is misleading. The top that arrived at my house seemed much grayer and muddier than the one in the image. Whereas the picture shows a top that has huge swathes of color with some gray patches the top I'm currently wearing has huge swathes of gray broken up by patches of color.
3.0,"i got this for my daughter she is 4ft tall so we got the large. It fits fine but it's definitely a close fit. It is a lot more orange than red. The eye's look like they are glued on with one dot of glue. So this probably won't last much past halloween night in tact. But my red panda was what she wants to be so it's fine, but a bit pricey for the quality."
3.0,Fits a bit loser and the tie is not attached at all — no loops for it. Good deal for $10 bucks but not worth more
3.0,Super pretty and full but flaked little pieces of red string. Just a little annoying picking it off my clothes.
3.0,"There was no reindeer on it, it had abominable snow man"
3.0,it's super cheaply made...
3.0,"Pretty dress.  True to size.  It hit me at a funny spot, so I returned.  It is definitely below the knee. I would call it is tea length dress.  Just wasn't what I was looking for.  If it was knee length, I would have definitely kept it."
3.0,It is super cute and well made. It runs small.
3.0,"Difficult to get on. Sizing isn't right, because of the high back. It does not allow it to be adjusted around your ankle. This causes it to rub, leading to blisters."
3.0,"Not sure how I feel about this bra. It felt comfortable on the cup area, and it some support. However; the straps are not comfortable.  It feels a tight and you cannot adjust the length.  Not sure if I will or will not buy more.  I'm still thinking about it."
3.0,It’s kind of boxy.  Like how it’s sewn together the dress is boxy. I would have to drop a size to have it fit snug but then my ass would be out to play.
3.0,"I bought these as stocking stuffers. They are equivalent in quality to socks you can buy at the dollar store. They are pretty cute, though definitely get weird looking on people with larger feet: the paw print on the bottom just looks odd."
3.0,"There is a square label inside in the back. When I peeled it off to wear the leggings, a sticky mess was left on the material. Cannot wear the leggings like that. I returned them immediately.  Stupid place for such a sticky label.  Cannot recommend."
3.0,I like to wear hospital socks around the house. The ones I received are not exactly the ones shown in the picture and they run a bit smaller than usual XXL hospital socks. I like to wear them really loose but these fit more like regular socks. The nonslip is wearing down really fast.
3.0,I liked it and it is cute but the short was dirty and there was no waist adjusting. My girl is thin and the short is big on her i have to take it to the tailor for fixing the waist.
3.0,Love the look and style but hated the material and returned the dress.
3.0,Only had a few weeks and it broke.
3.0,it was ok just a little bit bigger than i expected
3.0,"I really wanted to love this. Such a fun costume for Halloween or day of the dead time. You can really dress it up or keep it casual for a party, EDC, 5K, dia de Los Muertos, costume party etc. The fit was a little off for me so I had to return."
3.0,I'm sure I will get use out of it this winter but it is a little big for me and probably a bit wide as well.
3.0,"This did not work at all for stretching my boots. I can see where it would be good for sandals or flats. The stretcher can't be easily used in the confined space, and slipped back in the boot when I finally got it to the open position."
3.0,"It fits a little big, and thick. But I love the quality & the printing on fabric one I got from different company couldn’t read the message of mask!"
3.0,The shoes are nice and my nephew loves them. The issue is that they’re way way too big. The sizing is off.
3.0,"It's a good watch strap, looks solid and feels great. Two caveats though:<br />1. the strap can be a bit thick for some watches (such as mine). Even if you can get it through spring bars, it would create an awkward shape/angle for the parts near spring bars<br />2. the color is not exactly gray but close enough and I have no problem with that."
3.0,"Nice but didn,t fit"
3.0,This was okay. The earring was a little big for my ear and kept falling off.
3.0,"The fit and delivery speed were great! The fabric however is unexpectedly, and unfortunately, extremely sheer."
3.0,"it seems somewhat small for the size. it seems to be made well, but with kids they grow out of them before they wear them out"
3.0,"Similar to other reviewers, I have had a hard time finding warm gloves that fit my 3yo well. She attends outdoor preschool so she needs layers to stay warm in the elements.<br /><br />Pluses: The price is right (about $3/pair). These gloves are warm, fit her hands well, AND fit inside her waterproof ABECKO mittens.<br /><br />Minuses- They aren't windproof- the wide knit lets cold air in. They have loose threads and leave fluff all over the place, I bet they don't last long. We were also sent duplicate colors instead of the six unique patterns advertised."
3.0,I loved the color.  Yet the dress was just too much fabric and too long for me.
3.0,This dress is beautiful and comes as pictured. I did give the dress three stars because I had asked the seller if this dress would be ok for someone who was 5'2 and couldn't wear heels and they said yes. I received the dress and found it dragged on the ground and not in a cute way. It is at least an inch and a half too long. I will get it tailored.
3.0,nice size for tablet
3.0,I'm usually an L but I bought 2xl.<br />The dress it's alright but the sleeves are to tight.  I had to cut the sleeves and resew them. Lost time .
3.0,"The color was not the same as shown in the photo, the material is a nice quality."
3.0,It is pretty cute but when I went to put it on one of the pieces snapped.
3.0,"These seem to be too thin. After one wash the pattern is not erased, but broke at second wear."
3.0,Run a little small but cute...
3.0,Super tiny & very thin. I really did expect better quality. Comes in a nice gift box but really not gift material. I help for myself as regular pins.
3.0,"The actual poncho is small. I am 34B, 135lbs, 5'9 and perhaps the fit was short on me because of my height, however, the picture on the mannequin looks like it's oversized and longer. It's not.<br /><br />The metallic thread (which I honestly didn't realize it was metallic when I ordered) is a weird copper color and creates an unpleasant contrast against the light grey. Didn't love it, back it goes."
3.0,Size is deceiving.
3.0,"They are comfortable but I would like them longer, right below the knee."
3.0,The sleeves are really long and baggy. I'm considering trying to shrink it in the dryer a little or sew the ends of the sleeves so they don't fall of my hands as easily.
3.0,Not lasting material.
3.0,It’s a lovely set but the earrings are uncomfortable.
3.0,They were hard to put on and they came off very easy.
3.0,it’s exactly like the picture but it was a bit big. Not super big on me but definitely wasn’t snug like how it should be. kinda wide in the boob area so it’s not ideal for smaller chests
3.0,The fit was much smaller than expected
3.0,Pretty good brush
3.0,"One broke the first day I wore it, but that's expected for the price. You get what you pay for and I'm okay with that."
3.0,I love the shorter sleeve tops. The 3/4 length looks a bit boxy.
3.0,to small and it took a long time to get it
3.0,"Used for church usher uniform.  Too short and after I washed it, it shrunk.  Hard to get wrinkles out."
3.0,"While this set was very attractive and the color matched the outfit perfectly I purchased it for, I was slightly disappointed in its size.  It's center stone size was smaller than I had envisioned and would have really made a fashion statement had not been bolder."
3.0,This product arrived extremely wrinkled and not clipped to the cardboard insert. I'm hoping it was simply poorly packaged and not a previously returned item.
3.0,"My son is a 1.5 in his Nike sneakers that supposedly run small.  I ordered 1 in these, they fit, but not roomy enough to keep.  Went to order a size 2, but it won't arrive for 4-6 weeks...  I also have a feeling that going up a full size will be too big anyway.  Would really love to be able to get a 1.5.  It's unfortunate, because they seem like really nice shoes.  I've always bought name brand, and the look and feel of these is equal, if not better than name brand.  Also, most kids waterproof hikers are stiff or heavy, and these are neither."
3.0,"I bought 4 o these, 3 out of the 4 were broken.  The first one I opened, I noticed the chain was broken near the clasp.  The second one I opened, I went to open the clasp and the internal clasp part broke off.  The 3rd one, the clasp just sticks open.  The 4th one is just fine.  I did email the sender and told them of the problem, they asked for pictures to verify and said they would send me replacements.  The overall quality is just stunning for their price.  The chain is a bit shorter than average, I think.  The pendent comes to about high-mid chest on me."
3.0,It's a little too thick for a chain pendants don't fit over clasp.
3.0,Its was very pretty for my wife but the pearl aready fall off wondering if tht can be fix thnk u let me know .....
3.0,"I cannot rate the product shown as I did not receive what is pictured.<br /><br />The picture shows a set and I received half a set.<br /><br />The 0.25ct stud arrived by Unites States Post Office in a tiny plastic bag inside a bubble protected envelope. That was O.K.<br /><br />Therefore, I must give it a ""Neutral"" 3 Stars to be FAIR.<br /><br />If I am to rate a product I must receive what is advertised.<br /><br />End of Comments."
3.0,"I knew this was cropped, but did not work for me. Barely covered my chest and I sized up."
3.0,"I bought a medium basing of the other reviews that the sweatshirts were a size bigger then what's ordered, which is true. I usually get a large and with the med I got it felt like a large, although I have a feeling this was designed for taller people, I'm 5'7 which is a bit on the short side but it was a bit too long. I'm starting to think I should have gotten a small. Other then that it's a good, warm, comfortable sweatshirt. I'm still going to wear it but just be aware to go a size smaller then what you are use to at least"
3.0,My only complaint with this purse is tht it is rather thin.. the zipper broke the first day I carried it and I didnt have much in it because its sooo flimsy.... really cute purse..  I wouldnt recommend buying this if you are looking for an every day tote.. the only thing you can put in here is a cell phone .. a tablet and your wallet ... its large but very thin and flimsy.
3.0,It’s very pretty but I can’t breath with it on. It stays too close to my mouth and fogs  up my glasses<br />Wish it fit better so I could wear it
3.0,"They are so skin tight that they look like tights rather than leggings. And, because I live alone, I couldn't pull them all the way up in the back."
3.0,"I typically wear a 32 band, I ordered this size and it did not fit at all.  It was way too small.  I measured and it was 25 inches.  I also thought it should have tapered some since it was a longer bra, however this was not the case.  Other than fit being way too small the bra was expected."
3.0,"Cute suit, colors nice and design nice. For me it just had to much spandex, seemed to me it would need constant readjusting as it was silky fabric.<br />Just didn't do it for me but cute suit for the price for sure."
3.0,"I couldn't get my arch into the boot, so I can't really say anything good or bad about them.  They're prettier than seen online; I wish I could have worn them."
3.0,"The size chart seems to be way off to the extreme. It jumps from a 38 bust medium, up to the large fitting a 47 or 48 bust which makes it huge. I wish I had sized down in this. The print is nice, but the sizing seems to be a large leap and not the best fit after the medium. There's nearly a 10 inch difference in bust size. I tried to tie it up on the side, but it just fits too baggy. I thought that perhaps it was a misprint since a medium would have probably been too snug. I'm 5'7"" and 140 lbs. The large is more like a 2XL in anything else."
3.0,Disappointed because of size. I really like this dress.
3.0,Gifts for my team and they liked them
3.0,My hands won’t allow me to get them on
3.0,I chose fit as expected because its really not somewhat large. It just doesn't stay secure on my on head. It will shift and show my bald head and I don't notice it until I see myself in a mirror. No one has the guts to tell me before I have noticed.
3.0,"This was much more sheer than I expected. I will have to wear something under it like a camisole. Other than that I love the fit, and style and quality. But it is really sheer."
3.0,"Not bad at all. I guess the quality of the material is what you get for the price which is understandable. If anyone has sensitive skin, this material will definitely irritate it.<br />Overall it’s a nice shirt."
3.0,"I ordered the gray, which turned out to me be more of a brownish gray color. Wasn’t what I was expecting. Overall it looks like quality material though. With the right color, I would have loved it!"
3.0,"These are definitely NOT high quality, the fabric is very lightweight (flimsy) However, I am happy with my purchase because these are for playtime and they serve their purpose. (FYI: These are advertised as beach shorts, I certainly would not want my man to wear these at the beach or even out of the house!)"
3.0,They fit well and they keep my husband cool. The only draw back is they're somewhat mesh like a pair of basketball shorts would be. Those little holes get snagged on things and won't be wearable long term for him.
3.0,Not as soft as I wanted for mom.
3.0,"The watch band was a little big for my lady wrist, is there a smaller size for small wrists?"
3.0,Very difficult to put in and the stones started falling out
3.0,Not sure this is an accurate scale still testing it against other scales
3.0,"Ok quality, price a little high compared to others. Will give as gifts to kiddos."
3.0,"Acceptably easy to adjust.  However if you have small wrists you may want to look into a different band (the magnetic ones) that can accommodate a small wrist (6.5 inches around), This one just doesn't work for me."
3.0,Medium is more like a small. Colors are nice but elastic does not look like it will hold up well. Good for a straight figure without many curves so that the panties won't roll up or down.
3.0,"Sterling silver, so it doesn't turn my finger colors.  The turquoise is not real but it is pretty.  I've gotten compliments on it already.  The way the turquoise is attached to the ring, it does get my hair caught in it often."
3.0,The quality wasn’t what I was expecting
3.0,"Cute but small, order a size up. I’m 5’4”, 38D. The boob cups are stupid!!! They’re round and a lot smaller than my boobs so I changed it out. Mine also has some weird white string on side ."
3.0,Beautiful shirt. Just the zipper came off easily
3.0,It's super cute and fits great but the fabric is weird like scratchy feeling.
3.0,"Great quality pj bottoms, but run large and very long."
3.0,A little more lightweight than I expected.
3.0,"The material is not what I expected. It feels cheaper and tougher than I would have thought. Also, the color was off."
3.0,Runs small and a bit see through.
3.0,The shoulders fit a little strange have a hard time getting the dress to fit just right. But overall cute and comfortable
3.0,"I like the size, but it's on the smaller side. Couldn't fit as many things in there as I would have liked.. Credit cards won't fit, but my spare 18650 batteries and zippo fits fine. Loophole fits perfectly on my tactical belt, and the materials and quality seem great for the price. I wanted it to be a bit bigger, and I would have given it 4 stars, but it didn't quite live up to my expectation. Regardless, it is a great buy and maybe I will update in a few months to add a star."
3.0,Poor quality; cheaply made. Coloring is off; not grey more like a lavender color. Hideous!
3.0,"Just seems to run small and the large is probably a medium.  Not something to order again.  Nice cotton, so giving it 3."
3.0,Cute well made dress but if you are curvy/ fuller figured go up a size unless you like very form fitting. Too snug for my liking so returned. Quality material and appeared well made.
3.0,kinda heavy
3.0,This was a bit bigger than I thought. I didn’t like the zipper around the outside either.
3.0,"The shirt is adorable, but the pants are rough and scratchy. Not sure if I can launder them soft enough for my son to wear. You get what you pay for....but the shirt is a win!!!"
3.0,They run Big
3.0,Too clingy and not that flattering.
3.0,"Large, cheap looking. Seems more suitable for a child's dress up (but what do you expect for the price?) It is what it is."
3.0,"Gives me the worst cameltoe ever lol. Order a size down, these run big."
3.0,Smaller than it looks on-screen.
3.0,Some are really cute but a lot of it just looks really cheap. The chain bracelets and necklaces break easy.
3.0,"I bought this dress for the marine corps ball. Ordered August 29th, arrived October 3rd. That’s fine. No problem. On the picture it looks very Vegas Chic, which is what I was going for. Not really what I got. It had the biggest, tackiest bow on it. Luckily it was so loosely stitched I could cut it off without really damaging the dress (I’m getting the slit sewn to the knee anyways). Next, there’s a belted rope that is made of tulle on it. It’s a different red color than the dress. Hate it even more than the bow. I think I’m going to use the bow to cover it up. The feathers don’t exactly look like they do in the photo either, there’s much less of them. Thinking about adding some more myself, but haven’t decided. They don’t stay up like they do in the photo, but I think some freeze spray will do the trick with that. Overall, the dress is just okay. If I wanted a project, it wouldn’t have been something I intend to wear to a military function with my husband and his bosses. Once I see the tailor I will try to come back and update my review more, and maybe even submit a photo. We’ll see."
3.0,"I loved it the moment I set eyes on it. I have small wrists so this one is perfect for my size. I wore it immediately and people would think I have the real thing since I match it with my real gold & diamond eternity ring. However, I have not had it for about 3 months and it broke, meaning the metal snapped. Since it would take a lot of money, time and effort on my hands to return it, (I live in the Philippines), it's just left there in my jewellery box being useless."
3.0,Runs small. Shorter than I prefer.
3.0,Fairly cheap plastic construction.
3.0,"I like them, but smaller than the ones I got at Walmart."
3.0,"The product is just as it appears in the description, but a little heavy.  It carries a tablet and other work products just fine."
3.0,Comfortable but I returned them because the inner mesh brief was visable through the out mesh because the inner brief is white. I don't understand why they would make the outer brief a dark color with white inner brief.
3.0,Earrings did not look like picture but  cute. The earrings do not hang properly.  I would not recommend or repurchase.
3.0,"DRESS RUNS EXTREMELY SMALL.  I am 5'3&#34; ~140 lbs and typically wear a size 6-8 or Medium, I ordered a XXL after reading reviews.  It fits almost perfectly, in fact it's still a bit tight in my hips (which are 40&#34;).  The material is VERY THIN, I suspect it will shrink.  I'll definitely have to wear something underneath b/c it's so shear. The dress is also quite long, without heels, it drags on the floor. Still very cute for July 4th."
3.0,"I like the bag as I bought it as an alternative to carrying around a normal backpack to and from work. It works great for that, but unfortunately, it suffers from the same problem as every other drawstring bag: the inability to  carry it comfortably. It either rides too low, constantly swinging into your lower back, or when you attempt to fix the straps to sit higher, they twist, cutting into your shoulders.<br /><br />I like it for what it is though, a lightweight bag to carry the during the 1/2 mile trek to and from work."
3.0,Its flimsy. For this price you can find better earings at Tjmax or Marshalls. The lock barely closes on one of the earing. It broke as soon as I opened it. Ki
3.0,"Not much else to say except it's not that green and leans a bit on the yellow side.  Quality-wise, you get what you pay for."
3.0,batteries died pretty quickly. annoying.
3.0,The resin on top of the picture was not fully covering the top of one of the plugs. Really hard to unscrew once in your ear and very skinny. Not for me but I also have chonky lobes even at 22mm.
3.0,Looks as pictured. Had a few loose pieces of thread to tuck away and the fabric for the pockets isn't completely sewn to the jacket.
3.0,"Fits well, but the material is so sheer, that it was overstretched after the first wear. I am a slender build and it was not overly tight when first tried on. It is definitely comfortable however. I just wouldn't recommend it if what you're after is more support."
3.0,"One did not fit like the other. I like this brand and have two long leggings by them that are great. But in this two pack, the black fit great but the red was cut differently. They were both marked as the same size but the red did not have as high a waist so it was either have a low waist and have my gut hang over or pull them up tight and have an uncomfortable crotch. They are a nice, comfortable material thy is not see through, but I just wish the red were cut the same as the black. I understand this happens though with clothes sometimes. I would still recommend it but be prepared for differences."
3.0,"Shipping took a very long time, once it came, it was okay."
3.0,Both straps broke off at the top at nearly the same time within a year of use - cute bag- but will break
3.0,Good quality but not what I expected.
3.0,I like them but don't love them.  Got them for gifts and thought they would be bigger.  I kept for myself and do enjoy wearing them.
3.0,Cute shoes but run small
3.0,Fun. Nothing more.
3.0,"I love these pajamas, but I bought the large, and the waist is pretty tight.  It may keep me from wearing them as much as possible.  I am 66 and homebound and really wanted something to wear all the time during the winter.  Bought about 5 sets."
3.0,"This suit is not made for an average height person. It was tighter than expected up top, more like an athletic suit and I would call this a modesty cut as it came up too far. it was very long in the torso which made the whole thing not fit. If you're taller and not curvy at all, this would fit and look well."
3.0,"This wallet has both positive and negative aspects, to start, a good rugged design that secures your cards in all ways makes it a highly sought after product.  It is a bit bulky for me, I would possibly use it more while traveling with a backpack but for daily trips in shorts or pants, too much for me.  A good product if you want a rugged wallet."
3.0,It's a very nice wallet just not what I ordered!
3.0,THis top clothing is nice and stretchy. The only problem is the shirt is too big. But I still kept it and gave it to my mother-in-law.
3.0,Great look - runs very small.
3.0,"It looks much bigger and &#34;slouchier&#34; on the photo than it actually is. The brim is smaller and not as extended into the back as the picture shows. I really wanted a hat that wouldn't squash my hair down and had a lot of room to fold over the back a bit as the photo shows.  I do like the color and it fits, but it's snug."
3.0,Size up. Runs small
3.0,Looked like plastic.
3.0,Awkward length- I’m tall. 5’9. It hits half way between the knees and ankles and swishes a lot when walking
3.0,"Great Dress! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't come with a belt! It's a wrap dress with no wrap! And it didn't come to the floor, which I was disappointed since I saw so many reviews saying it did for tall people. I'm 5'9&#34; and wore flats, it still didn't cover my ankles."
3.0,No way this belt is full grain but its ok as an informal wear
3.0,I wanted a sweat shirt. This is too thin to be considered a sweatshirt.
3.0,This dress is okay. Not very fond of the material
3.0,"The shirt weight is very heavy and stiff, like the free shirts you get for promotional items when you fill out a credit card application or something.  I find those shirts to be less comfortable and less stylish (&#34;stylish&#34; is of course relative, but by that I just mean not something you'd normally wear if you're under 45 years old)."
3.0,"The color name for this hat is misleading. It specifically calls this color ‘wheat’ right in the item description heading, yet the tag attached by the manufacturer says ‘tan’. Make no mistake, the hat *is* tan. I’m not sure how to describe this concept other than to say wheat is a lighter color than tan. It was too dark of a color for me. If those colors mean the same thing to you, you’ll love this hat! If the exact color is important to you, buyer beware. I returned this hat due to the color not being as expected.<br /><br />Color-aside, this is a great hat! It is similar to (but not identical to) the one sold at Costco in 2018 (my reason for purchasing bc I love and miss that hat so much, LOL). It fits well and would provide good sun protection. The best part of this hat is the sunglass loops!! They are such a great feature and surprisingly difficult to find in a nice hat. The inside of the hat does have an adjustable ribbon. It does not have an adjustable chin strap, which was a lesser reason for returning. My (lost) Costco version of this hat did have that feature and I certainly would have missed it, had I decided to keep this hat."
3.0,"The fabric and stamp is nice, but it fits very small<br />I usually wear sice small, I ordered medium and it still didn’t fit me, I will try to order a large!"
3.0,It’s definitely a warm vest without using the battery but the wires seem to bend to easy and now it doesn’t stay on. Not worth the price for that.
3.0,"I was so excited for this mask and I have to say that the picture quality is stunning! My dislike comes from the fact that it made my sweat in just the area the mask was! Super hot and itchy! Soooo itchy like when your mom would put you in itchy church socks! The whole area where the mask was was just covered in condensation when I took it off! The fabric made me feel like I had 1,000 ants crawling all over me too! I’m so sad cause it’s so pretty!"
3.0,These are not made for thick arms
3.0,Strange cut!
3.0,Nice fit not as warm as I expected
3.0,"Even though the info was wrong, that was my fault, the band was just too long and itch.  It irritated my skin until I was waking up with welts from scratching in my sleep.  I understand it is meant for exercise but it should still be comfortable on."
3.0,"Got this for my wife, the sleeves are too short and tight. The rest of it's the right size though. Seems like someone took the sleeves from the smaller size and sewed them onto this one."
3.0,This is very soft and fits well. But I really don’t like the knit fabric. It is actually hard to breathe with or talk a lot while wearing this because it sort of gets sucked into your nose when you inhale.<br />Disappointed
3.0,It is so much darker than picture and more olive.
3.0,these are okay
3.0,It will not stay up over my nose unless I put it over my ears
3.0,"The fabric is soft and warm, but it’s not a good dress for smaller boobs. I wear a 32B and the front part that covers the chest kept sliding down all night."
3.0,"This was very poorly made, as far as size goes.  The shorts are for a 6 year old and the top was for a 3 year old. It would've been very. Ute if it were proportionate.  The top fits perfect, but the shorts look like a clown.  I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,The yellow part of the slipper is Raised so it's like walking on  platforms  so his feet constantly slide off to the sides when he walks
3.0,"I love the idea of this dress, but it was a little tight when it came in.  I usually always wear a medium, but the medium was definitely snug.  Size up!"
3.0,Started to have holes right away.
3.0,Very cute but it runs big for baby 3/6 months size
3.0,Definitely falls off with sweat.  It doesn't seem to give me any lift.  It seems to make my breasts look like they hang very low and awkwardly on my chest.
3.0,"My daughter loved the charm. We have 2 dachsunds and she was so excited to receive the charm. Color is more of a yellow and not a gold color, which is probablymore durable."
3.0,Love the size and adjustable length of the strap BUT the Navy Blue is quite dark! Almost appears black! So keep that in mind when ordering.
3.0,"I would gladly give this product a 5 star review if I had received the correct size. I loved the colors, but the first one I received was a medium, but it was way too small. Thinking it was due to my ""major expansion project"" of my body, I sent it back and ordered the large. The large was appropriately sized and was too big! I gave up and returned the dress. It would have been perfect!"
3.0,I was not too excited about the material of the coat
3.0,"I have posted already...hat pretty, your business ethics are questionable."
3.0,The shoes are cute but haven't held up as well as most shoes do. The tab in the back broke off so my daughter can't wear them with the strap any longer.
3.0,It is good. But i wish there's a small size.
3.0,"Cute dress, but had to return - too small. :-("
3.0,El tamaño muy bien.<br />Los colores del vestidos no son como la foto se ven desgastados.
3.0,Love this tank but definitely runs small! Order a a size up
3.0,Scratches too easy.
3.0,"This is a good value for the price and number of bras. I love the color variation and the fit is accurate. However, after a few washes they begin falling apart. The underwire started slowly popping out on each one of mine within a month and some the cups started folding out (despire that I hang dry mine). So they're nice, but don't last long for quality."
3.0,"I thought it was silver paint but it's golden color, and very small size"
3.0,"Very nice leather and look. Diamanté start to come off quickly and, in my opinion, a bit too easily."
3.0,"The ears are not stabilize, it move out of position as you move around, so you have to readjust it."
3.0,"Scratchy material, rough on face"
3.0,"Bought these as a holiday gift for my MIL, she did not like them. The earrings are fine but are very very thin and the hoop is about the size of a half dollar.<br />Personally, I would wear these but the gold is not my  favorite for everyday jewelry.  Returned them since we have no use, but a nice comfortable hoop."
3.0,"Overall I like the dress. The colors are great and it's soft. The only two things that are negative is that the straps are NOT adjustable (as it stated in the title).  Actually I cut them and sewn them on a way that fit me better. And second, the top fabric is slightly see through when worn with a LIGHT colored bra so use a nude bra :)"
3.0,They work. But I have to wear other socks with them
3.0,I liked the dress. However it fit larger than I wanted.
3.0,"it pains me to rate this dress lower - i was so excited to receive it.  i love polka dots and this is just a fun cut.  looking straight at this dress, it seems like a perfect fit.  to be honest because it's black, and the entire front body (elbows and waist down) all fit perfectly, no one would have any idea that the back and the top sleeves run a size smaller than the rest of the dress.  let me be clear - the top of my arms are normal sized, i have never run into situation where that one spot did not fit unless the entire dress did not fit.  but seemingly from elbow to elbow across the back, it's just smaller.  it's so weird.  i can wear this dress for photograpshs or a situation where i would be standing always but i would not be comfortable sitting in this dress, muchless enjoying a meal or driving.  i felt like i was going to Incredible Hulk the entire back while just trying it on.  from the elbows down though, it is really really loose and flowy, it's like two different sleeves make up the whole of it.  if your arms are super toned, but not buff and stuff - you will not experience this, i hope.  the next thing that kind of threw me was the self belt - it's attached and just half of the dress, so can tie it middle up front, to the side (one ribbon will just be considerabley longer), or in the back which kind of looked juvenile so i undid it right away.  if you have a tiny middle section and the smaller sizes have the same length belt maybe there's a wraparound situation, but such was not the case for me.  because it's attached though, the only option for trying a different belt is to cut them off, which, don't do that.  the back is an elasticized waist and pointedly the only 'stretchy' part of this dress.  i would prefer a same style waist all of the way around, especially when the little bit of stretch is not where i need it.  and as the title points out, it's a mock wrap.  there is a snap on the upper chest area to ensure you don't flash the world, but there are no other fastens or zips on the dress.  this dress is really super cute and the details are really fun.  i ordered the best size based on the size chart and for all intents and purposes it totally fits, but the upper arms and back just feel tight and different sized, i would not have wanted a larger size because then the rest would be too big.  bummed."
3.0,Was really hoping these would slide on a lot nicer. Pretty tight. Won't buy again.
3.0,Clasp would not work.
3.0,"These were ok for every day earrings, especially for younger girls.  They are not a statement piece for sure.  I thought these were OK.  The backs stayed on and they didn't bother my ears (nickel makes me itch).  All in all, if you're thinking of these as a gift, they were OK quality and just ordinary."
3.0,Cheap and image is very stiff..disappointing
3.0,"My kids wanted some so I got them. I am definitely not a supporter of animal products, but i gave in to my kids' wishes. Bad choice. It stank the whole house up and now my kids are depressed after realizing they were real rabbit's feet. We do have a rabbit, after all."
3.0,"It works, daughter likes it but holes for the eyes are small and too wide apart, so you can’t see much when you wear it. I’m keeping it because it’s too much hassle to return it, but we will try to make the holes bigger ourselves."
3.0,This seemed like great quality upon first look. My daughter wore it for a basketball tournament for the first trial run. The Nike sign lifted almost halfway with first use. We used parchment paper and iron to tack it back down. Because of the delicate nature I would suggest hand wash and line dry.
3.0,"I wear 11 1/2 shoes, ordered these 11 1/2 - 12 1/2 and my toes are at the end and they're narrow. Order a size up"
3.0,Very poorly made. Had to fix a lot of loose threads. Fits ok for a 5'4&#34; 130# person.  Will have to hem a tad though. Be sure to wear wedges so you don't get your heels caught.
3.0,This is a really cute tank however there is a gap in the fabric that is just below the bust line. It doesn’t effect the fit but I could see where it might gap open.
3.0,is hot when wear them
3.0,Not flattering and long.
3.0,Jacket is way to small pants fit perfectly. I’m 200 lbs and i ordered an XL in the pink suit. I wore a white t shirt wit colorful print and wore the jacket around my waist. It looked cute but i was expecting the jacket to b longer and to fit around my breast not stop on the side. Its cute an all but won’t reorder this set!
3.0,The pjs are soft just a bit more snug that I would like.
3.0,"Can't complain for the price, bought them for spare driving glasses and they serve their purpose well on sunny days."
3.0,"To me the Buckle was the best part of this belt.  The webbing is designed with a velcro adjustment in it,  unfortunately that's the problem. For mounting the gear on the belt it was easy, but once in use and moving throughout a multi position/firearm shooting course the belt keeps wanting to come apart at the velcro. Then add in some dirt and sand to the velcro and it's extremely easy for it to come undone."
3.0,It looks cheap. Maybe it's ok for the price but I didn't like it or would recommended it. Also I was looking for a &#34;slim&#34; wallet and this one isa bit bulky
3.0,"Great glasses and comfortable for my large size head. Comes with a nice hard shell case. Only giving three stars though, because my glasses arrived with a scratch already on the lens. I'm rough on glasses as it is, but to start out with a scratch not made by self is a huge bummer. Would have given five stars otherwise."
3.0,"If you are looking for a snug fit, I suggest going down a size. I ordered according to the size chart. My tops fit like blouses. I had to give them to someone.<br />The colors are beautiful, however."
3.0,Fit ok. Definitely not long leg compared to my usual froots of da loomiss long leg
3.0,"Was cute, I almost kept. Just too romantic for me to think it was practical. But could be really fun. I'm 5'2&#34; and the length was still fine."
3.0,"Returned the item, the top part was waaay too big."
3.0,"Overall, not a bad product for the price. The wings were smaller than anticipated and the straps were a little tight. The feathers did fall off occasionally as well."
3.0,"The product is attractive and stylish. My wife loves. However the watch does not appear to work. I can't find a way to wind it. The movement says quartz which I assume means it's electric, but I can't find one of those clear tabs to pull out to activate the power circuit. Perhaps it wa shipped with a dead battery?"
3.0,"Looks cheap. When I ordered it thought it would be a little more quality but it looks like something out of dollar store. Very heavy and we'll written, just wasn't what I excpeted."
3.0,I had too much fabric behind my heal.
3.0,"I love the shape, sturdy frames, color and the lenses are right on. But they are too tight. If I wear too long I get a headache. I'm so bummed."
3.0,I purchased these shorts after recently having a baby. I bought them a little bigger and they work for around the house. The denim is a thinner material.
3.0,"De brazos queda ajustado elegí bien la talla pero de cintura me queda un poco grande. De largo quedó perfecto por mi altura, pero si es para una persona de baja estatura le queda larguísimo."
3.0,Definitely too thin to be worn in the winter if you live in a state where temps go below 32. Otherwise good for fall and spring weather.<br />Like the 2 in 1 jacket concept. Like the vibrant color.<br />Fit a bit larger than expected.
3.0,I had been watching these forever and they finally were discounted. I guess I didn't realize matte rose gold was brown. And both rings have lines from the mold on the 'gem'. I guess they'll do for camping.
3.0,Followed the sizeChart def size up! Material wasn’t as expected
3.0,Nice and soft. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and they were still a little small. Especially the top.
3.0,"This is my second time ordering these. I loved the first pair so much- I wore them out! The second pair was not the same material, they seemed a faded black and were not as breathable or flexible. I was pretty disappointed.. the only good thing about these are the length."
3.0,Ok bag but really didn’t have that much room in it unless you’re strictly using it for a few pens and pencils.
3.0,Super small & it was very hard for my little sister to unscrew it
3.0,"I was given a size small bottom and large top. At first, I was horrified by how I had to squeeze my peach into those bottoms. I recently lost 22lbs and this was a major blow to my self esteem but when I realized they were small, I felt a little “better” but really need the large bottoms because I’m short but I’ve got back, yall. 😅"
3.0,"The design is for it to be flowy and it is! Cute, simple dress however when I put it on, it's just too much extra material. Not flattering on my body."
3.0,The bracelet is nice but the color is very pale. Not at all like the vibrant purple color in the picture.
3.0,Ordered small for my daughter’s sweet sixteen! Runs a little big. Style isn’t exactly like pictures. Bottom of dress doesn’t flare out like picture. Dress does have a small train
3.0,"Very cute, but the watch broke on the first day of wearing it."
3.0,"This is a cool little mug, maybe 12 ounces, but cheap, as in poorly made. For example, I washed it and moisture crept into the clay. You could see the gray through the glazing. It also released moisture through the bottom for a couple of days after. This is a fun pencil holder but not a good mug. You get what you pay for here."
3.0,"It came very quickly which was a nice surprise. However, the red embellishment looks almost as if it was lazilly poured over most of the necklace, if you look at the image closely you can see what i mean. I got this to go with my Poison Ivy costume for Halloween and for this it was perfect, although do to the slight sloppiness and the fact that parts of the necklace are &#34;broken&#34; so that the curve of the necklace can lay properly would deter me from regular daily use. Both negatives I see are completely visible in the image provided so i can say they were honest about what you are getting, so overall i must say its a decent purchase that i certainly enjoyed for my purposes."
3.0,It is way too big. I ordered a large as mediums were always too small. Now I reordered another one in medium. Waiting for it to come.
3.0,"The dress in the picture is with more of an ikat dot print. The dress I received is most definitely a true polka dot print. Also, the material in the description states ""95% Rayon,5% Spandex,Comfortable and breathable."" The dress I received does not have any spandex or stretch at all. It is not comfortable nor breathable. The fit is quite smaller than expected. I will be returning"
3.0,"the shirt fit a little spot under the arms and lengthwise. It looked nice, it was just a little awkward for me."
3.0,sweatshirt has little weight..overall it’s good..
3.0,"This top was a little large. It's hard to wear a bra with this top, so if you are not chesty it may not stay up well."
3.0,So cute but the neckline is just too tight!
3.0,They with work but not to comfortable on the ears
3.0,"I will never ever ever understand why anyone would make a dress out of yoga pants material, but the friend I bought it for gets overheated easily so she loves it and I only took off one star for the absurd choice in material, and one for the cost they think their dress is worth. Wouldn't buy it again and certainly not at full price."
3.0,"I wear a 6.5 and bought the 6-7 (women), it was a half a size too small.  I have narrow feet and tried adjusting the straps but unfortunately I couldn't get them tight enough.  Because of these two reasons I ended up returning them. Sandals do feel very ""bouncy"" and I think they would be comfortable on the right size.  I didn't placed another order, thought; I think trying shoes before buying them works best for me."
3.0,"Way to big, and cheaply made"
3.0,keeping the mask. threw out the cloudy visor.
3.0,The shirt I received is not what is pictured. The fit is off and the shirt is a different fabric then pictured. The image differs from the image shown as well.
3.0,OK. Elastic is kinda loose but good for wearing....
3.0,"Much bigger than expected, still kinda cute but too heavy for my ears unfortunately"
3.0,Daughter thought this was very boring and I’ll agree it looked better in the picture
3.0,"Works great...but the black is horrible.  It turns your wristband black.  I guess that's ok if the wristband is black, but I prefer colors.  Otherwise, it works wonderfully.  I've ordered and received a bag of various colors from Bitbelt and am very happy."
3.0,"It's pretty, I'll give it that, but every time I wear it I have to fix it because it comes apart somewhere"
3.0,"I love this swimsuit, the top fit a bit different the expected, and I had a hard time with the straps. One actually fell off in the pool. I love the way the bottoms fit. They are truly high wasted and they fit a little shorter than I had thought they would. However the stitching on the bottoms pulled apart the first time I wore it, luckily its and easy fix. The color is true to the picture. Minus the flaws I had experienced I would defiantly recommend this suit. It's a good price just be weary of the stitching."
3.0,The shorts are comfortable. They do slide down all day. Long enough and are not see through. Need to find a true seamless panty though. I work outside and bought these to wick moisture. They do what I bought them for just wish I didn’t have to constantly pull them up. Not sure if they run big.
3.0,Theres no support at all so the girls are ousbed flat and uneven. It is very soft and comfy otherwise. The bottoms cut weird and pushed the softer part of my stomach out. I am returning:/
3.0,It's okay. The image isn't that great
3.0,"Its okay. The hardware is silver, not gold, and the band doesn't lay flat on your arm. Its not what I'd hoped for. That being said, it is leather and the leather is in good shape."
3.0,"It looks nice and is comfortable, but it snags all the time"
3.0,"It’s not bad, but I made mine into a skirt. I’m 5’9, and weigh 175lbs, pretty athletic build. I have long legs, so the fit was a little awkward for me. So I cut it right under the armpits, hemmed it, and made it into a skirt. So it’s now a little longer, high waisted skirt. It’s AMAZING!!!!"
3.0,"I love this top, but if you like to go braless, like myself, you can see shape, color, and detail of your nips"
3.0,I am not a fan of the sheen it gives off. It would be nice it has a matte finish. Overall it fits well. I hope in between leg parts doesn't wear off too much as my cotten spandex blend workout tights.
3.0,"It's lovely! But I make buy and sell jewelry for a living & this is just not worth $99.  It is a very thin, frail and fragile bracelet. It is also smaller than it appears in photos. Returning.  I have had really good luck with the turquoise network, and I will buy from them again, I was simply disappointed with this particular item."
3.0,La tela no parece la misma y en cuanto a las terminaciones su calidad no es ideal
3.0,"Wasn't super impressed with this suit. For the price, its a good value.  However....the fabric is rather flimsy, I cannot see it holding together well over repeated uses. The bottoms were ok, but the fabric is so thin, I see these having a hard time staying up, especially if you are in the water or saying, walking around, etc.  The top was better made, it wasn't as thin as the bottom. To me, the biggest drawback on this suit was the fringe.  The way it hangs, it basically draws the entire focal point of the suit straight to your belly. And if you are like me, and don't have the super flattest belly in the whole world....then it just accentuates any problem areas you might have around your middle. For me, it was rather comical, almost like a big fringe-y arrow pointing right at my troublesome belly.  I have never had this problem with a suit before. Maybe cutting the fringe would help with that, but then the top would just look odd.<br /><br />So its going back.  I wanted fun and sexy for my Vegas trip, and this did not deliver.<br /><br />Also, another reason for the 3-stars... this suit did NOT come with a sanitary liner in the bottoms.  I thought that was standard on all swimsuits that are being sold to the public.  Like, you know, for sanitary reasons."
3.0,I went off the size chart and some of the other reviews and this dress was much too large.  I love it but will be sending it back for a smaller size.
3.0,Soaks too thin for me.  Would not purchase additional orders.
3.0,"I was so excited to get this piece, but when it arrived it wasn't what I expected. It was very very big and shiny like costume jewelry. Will probably never wear it, just don't feel like sending it back."
3.0,"Like the length and the warmth.  Hate the metal zipper. It is very rough and will scratch anything it comes in contact with.  I have only worn it around the house.  Not sure it is worth time , trouble, and expense of replacing the zipper."
3.0,great dress but came in 2 sizes to big
3.0,"I see puffer jacket and think of the ones when I was younger..huge and thick but this one isnt. I guess if it doesnt say ""fleece lined"", that's probably the clue. Not that it's awful. It's a nice coat and color but not if your looking for a winter coat. And my kid is 3 and I got a 6t...barey zippers but he is a tall and huge kid so that might not be the jacket"
3.0,"I bought these gloves to use during Half Dome in Yosemite. I bought these based on some reviews that they were used for Half Dome. Maybe I got a bad set but my gloves wore thin, and the grip no longer worked when using them for the cables. I was then stressed that the gloves would not help hold on. I recommend other more durable gloves if you are using them for Half Dome. I’m lucky to be alive no thanks to these gloves."
3.0,"A good product, but getting the backing off the sticky surface is quite maddening."
3.0,"It’s cute and Made well however it was raining the other day in Atlanta, which isn’t a super windy place, and it went inside out, and I find it extremely difficult to close, which is actually super annoying so I will be buying another umbrella and only using this for travel once in a blue moon"
3.0,"Everything is perfect about this hoodie but, It's not a cotton hoodie. The person it was bought for loved it. I guess that's all that matters. So, this and light weight."
3.0,Very comfortable but too small.
3.0,Was not impressed watch was too small
3.0,Cute but material isn't all that great
3.0,The earrings are very pretty but tiny.  They look like a children's item.<br />There is no way to tell this when ordering based on the enlarged size shown in the picture.<br />There should be some size gauge to show customer so we know what to expect.
3.0,Didn't have an actual real bra just paddings
3.0,Decent material for the price. The photos came out great.
3.0,"I love the sleeves...the brown color is a little blah and the material is a bit thinner than I expected...what really threw me off was how short the sides were.  I have a very short torso so if I lift my arms up and you can see my skin, then it's made pretty short.  I liked it, and I read another reviewer say she wears a cami, but I didn't buy the shirt to wear a cami under it.  I haven't decided if I'm keeping it or not, but these are the reasons why I may return it."
3.0,"Usually I like Sketchers as they are a comfortable shoe. That is the reason I bought these. I had just started a new job which required me standing on my feet T least 6 hours per day. Having been retired for 3 years from an office position and now going into retail, I needed a comfortable shoe to stand in. Relying on the comfort and fit of my Sketchers relaxed fit tennis shoes, I ordered these. After standing in them for only a few hours, my toes began to hurt, the shoes appear to run a little too short for a size 7 relaxed fit, same size as my tennis shoes, and were quite uncomfortable. I tried wearing them for several days just in case they needed breaking in, but that didn't offer any relief. The shoes just run shorter than the normal size 7, should have gotten a 7 1/2 had I known! Very disappointed! Too late to return for exchange!"
3.0,Did not like the lriduct
3.0,nice shirt but runs small  i'm a large and ordered an extra large and sleeves were short<br />Otherwise 5 star
3.0,Love these shirts except that I ordered extra tall and they’re still not long enough to stay tucked in. I’m only 6’1” so it shouldn’t be this hard to find undershirts long enough to stay tucked in!
3.0,looks more delicate in the picture.
3.0,"doesn't fit my face great because they keep slipping off my head during the night and when they are on my face they JUST cover at the bottom.  They're not bad just need to fix the strap at the back so it's snug - you'd have to have a head the size of mars, even though it's adjustable a little, to make it snug and not slip off during the night"
3.0,"Received this item today. As much as we loved crib and the dresser, this item and the nightstand both arrived damaged (the boxes that they were packed it weren’t damaged though, so I assume the issue wasn’t a transportation, but the manufacturing). I just opened the request to replace the back panel of the nightstand with the manufacturer several days ago, so now I have to go through this again with this item as well. So frustrating 🤦‍♀️"
3.0,The dress was a perfect fit. But the blush pink it was entirely see through. If it wasn’t I would’ve definitely kept it.
3.0,"It fits, it works,my only complaint is that the stones were set unevenly on mine. I don't wear it because it stands out too much."
3.0,The shirt definitely fits smaller than typical adult small hoodies
3.0,"Weird gaps by the armpits, even with a 34 DD chest."
3.0,"These pants are so cute and seem like they would go well with so many tops but they just didn't fit my hips and bum the way I would've wanted. I'm usually a Medium/Large in bottoms depending on the item so I would recommend sizing up! Don't get me wrong, they fit really well around my waist, but they were just too tight around the hip area. I felt like one wrong move would've meant a huge rip. The fabric was pretty thin (not see through though) so they needed to fit really well.<br /><br />If you liked my review and found it helpful, let me know by clicking “Yes” and giving me a Helpful Vote ☺️ If you have any question about the item, don't hesitate to ask me!<br />*Honest, unpaid review by an Amazon Prime addict"
3.0,"I love the design in the moon shape, and overall the pendant.  It is just so small.  Careful where you buy, I have seen it for well over 100.00 and as low as 69.00, that is a big swing in price.  Better suited for  a charm bracelet.  I am saving mine to give to my daughter for her charm bracelet and continue to search for a statement pendant  that is much larger."
3.0,very pretty but way to large hurts my ears their sooo heavy.didnt realize it was ssoooo big
3.0,Really cute but order a size up for sure.
3.0,"Well for the price I'm not surprised, but the 8 bananas I got are like some weird bootleg versions. Their four peels aren't evenly spaced, their faces are poorly printed on and most of them are misshaped. I only know this because I have one banana already exactly as pictured and wanted more of them for my bag, waterbottle, etc. (I originally got it from YesStyle.com)<br />Eh, not entirely surprised, for the price I like them well enough, but wished I had gotten them as pictured."
3.0,I really liked the design for this product but the fit wasn't very true to size in my opinion. I generally wear a size L/XL and ordered the XL because I wanted it a bit loose and it was said to &#34;fit a size larger so order down a size&#34;. I am so glad I didn't follow that direction as it was very tight.
3.0,The metal parts that connect the strap broke within a week
3.0,It's a beautiful hat but there were some loose seems and a huge tag that was itchy but it looks to be a well made hat
3.0,"Slip underneath hardly covers my bottom, disappointed because it’s such a lovely dress."
3.0,I got the white one and it's cute but it was way to big. Other people said to size up in their review so I got a medium instead of a small but it was way too big. I would exchange it because I really like it but they don't have an extra small. I'm 5'1 117lbs.
3.0,Ordered this before & it was one pictured. This second one was a little disappointing as it had a clasp in the 3rd decade. I guess if you wanted to wear it. I liked the first one I received much better.
3.0,"It's okay. Decent quality. Mine was damaged as you can see in the pictures. I like it, though. It's not uncomfortable. Ring seems like a size 6 or 7."
3.0,5’9 160lbs order a size medium which fit great in the waist.<br />Cons- it was a lot shorter than anticipated and the cut on the dress neckline was uneven
3.0,I so wanted to love this romper but it is not made for my post baby curves. The waistline sits much higher then I expected but not in a cute high waisted tummy tucker way so I was left with a very unflattering lower belly area on display. It also doesn't help that it was somewhat see through. The fabric is also thin and felt more appropriate for a swim cover up then stand alone outfit. I am 5'8 and usually wear size 10-12 in dresses 12 in pants and I purchased the Large.
3.0,do not like the way it waskes.....a lot o fk pin palls afterwards
3.0,"Initial wear was super adorable.  After washing, the shirt shrunk and crinkled up. I was able to substitute another shirt with the pants/suspenders but the original shirt wasn't as high of quality as I would have expected."
3.0,When washed too small.
3.0,"In my opinion, the picture makes this look nicer than it is; it is very fragile and does not look like it will be durable for daily use. The product is a lot smaller than what I expected."
3.0,nicely made but too small for a charm around your wrist
3.0,"pretty, not a tailored suit, but comfortable"
3.0,I will never wear these sunglasses.  They are HUGE!  I was expecting large but not gigantic.
3.0,"The material is not very sturdy, I'm a petite girl, pretty fit with very little body fat yet this thing did very little/nothing for my posture."
3.0,Broke in about 5 months…
3.0,"It's cute but a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  The pendant was, I can't think of a comparison, as big as the round end of chapstik?"
3.0,Not for all head sizes
3.0,I didn't like that the armband was too short other than that very good price and product
3.0,This was special to me for personal reasons. Only bunny baby and mother I found.
3.0,"Shoes arrived in a plastic bag instead of a box, however they were as advertised. I should have read these reviews first because they do run large. I wore them anyway and received plenty of compliments. Only wore them twice before giving them to a coworker. I plan on purchasing another pair a half size smaller"
3.0,You get what you pay for. Had the sunglasses for two weeks and then they broke.
3.0,The colors are great! Fabric isn’t bad. Was really excited about these I too I washed them one time and it shrunk 2 sizes.
3.0,"Love the boy legs, but they are WAY too large, and my slacks and jeans slide down them.  Should be fine to  wear them with dresses, though."
3.0,Cute but the metal on the back of the watch was really scratched. I've thrown away the packaging so I'm keeping it but make sure to look at the watch carefully.
3.0,Too big and heavy for my petite frame. Made of quality materials. Returned it. Gorgeous otherwise.
3.0,The colors are beautiful but it runs pretty small!!!!
3.0,A little short for my liking covers back and front just short on the sides
3.0,These were tight on my feet. Very narrow for me. But they are cute.
3.0,Very small. The large was skin tight and I'm a size 10. Cute though.
3.0,Nice. Exactly what I thought I was getting.
3.0,I got a size larger and it was still small
3.0,A bit pricey for the size it actually is.
3.0,Very upset size large runs very large ...ordered according to size chart ...now need them asap so I will have to look for a real size 8 boys
3.0,"We are a family divided on these.  My son and I really like them, but my husband who put them in my elementary age sons shoes is not impressed at all.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />They are definitely long enough for kids and adults shoes.<br />They work, my son can not tie his shoes yet and he doesn't have to worry about the shoes with these laces in them.<br />They truly are reflective.  So yay for safety.<br />My son can adjust them, it isn't too hard for him.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />If you don't tuck the string in the laces, it sticks straight up and looks totally stupid.<br />It took my husband a while to get them adjusted right.<br />Not really for wide footed kids.  My son has a wide foot and he struggles to get his shoes on with these.  The alternative was to make the strings extra extra long and then it wouldn't have been able to fit under his laces and wouldn't have looked right at all.<br />Not enough elastic to really give.  See above.  Wider feet need more elastic for stretch.<br />Not good for high top kids tennis shoes.  These worked horribly.  Completely lost a pair on this. 😔<br /><br />They did stop my son from having to ask his teacher to tie his shoes 3 times a day while we work on teaching him to tie his shoes.  However, they definitely could use more elastic and some improvement.  This was our first pair so we may purchase another brand in hopes of finding a pai that fit our needs better."
3.0,"Very pretty, but too thick to be comfortable. My earlobes are still throbbing after taking them out.  If the part that you thread through the lobe were thinned down a bit they would be perfect."
3.0,its thin and not my style....
3.0,"These are nice and as pictured, BUT, I was sent a different design than what I ordered. Not worth returning when it took over a week to get here!! So much for the benefits of my annually prime membership!!"
3.0,"Quick delivery, quality is okay, but was disappointed in the sizing... Had to wash and dry it on high to get it to fit properly. But, price was okay"
3.0,looks nothing like the photo!  Doesn't have any white or purple jewels and is WAYYY bigger than pictured!
3.0,Nice color but it’s a bit small than expected. Short in sleeve length and buttons can fall off easily.
3.0,Color was totally different
3.0,Okay but not the greatest quality.
3.0,Would have given it a 1 star if the price was higher. The style is great but the quality is not good. The frame is not smooth polished black but has bumps and it feels like a toy. You get what you pay for. Cheap quality for a cheap price.
3.0,Nice Jersey fits well but has no padding at all. Alot of Moto cross jerseys have padding in the elbows or some sort this has none
3.0,"I really liked this when it came.  It's just the right size stone, pretty and dainty and doesn't look fake.  However I was very disappointed in the chain.  I got the rose gold because it's different and I have a few other rose gold items.  It looked great when it came out of the box and it fit comfortably.  The thing that was a bummer was I only wore it for 2 days the the chain turned an ugly almost black color.  I have never had a chain do that and I wear all kinds of costume jewelry.  I didn't get it wet or wear it in the shower and I was not sweating like on a hot summer day.  I could not figure out why it turned so fast like that.  Very strange.  As I said, pretty stone but maybe I should have gotten the gold or silver..."
3.0,Like spandex....but thinner?  It could have been cute but it ran small and squished my fat.
3.0,"This came in an envelope basically! Most of the letters were bent. I love the theory, but you also had to cut out each word cuz some were upside down!!!! Their packaging is awful! I cannot recommend this"
3.0,.  It does not come with batteries and has no instructions.  I was ready to return but my husband figured out how to put batteries in and it works fine. It does not play Christmas music.  It plays SHOUT!
3.0,"The watch is very nice, BUT the description is not accurate.  The band stares in one place in the images of the watch that the band width is 20mm, I ordered 20 mm and they were to small.  Returned those and ordered 22mm and those were to small.  Returned those and have ordered 24mm because they do not make 23.5mm bands as it states in a different place further down in the watch specifics.<br />Fix your descriptions so the the information is accurate and consistent."
3.0,Extra tiny priced too high.
3.0,good quality /very clear  reading on computer or iphon<br />unfortunately breaking easily at joints<br />which quite rigid
3.0,"Such a cute cut and fit wel, just pretty shear material so you can see the pad in the top abs the bottoms were sheer in the back!<br />Probably good for tanning but wouldn’t trust in the water.<br />I’m 5”9 and 140 ish I got a medium and could have probably sized down In the bottoms."
3.0,It was pretty but the picture was not accurate.
3.0,beware for the colours come out even after a few washings.
3.0,Okay. Could be warmer.
3.0,"Good tie, good price"
3.0,The material is not quite what i expected.  The design is nice.
3.0,To be honest I didn’t like these sweatpants.  They are on the thin side and they have the slim fit.  I like my pants with some space to work with (loose fit). I purchased them because I like the cargo pants style with the pockets.
3.0,"Loved this dress at first... very comfy and soft!  However, after I washed it the second time, It balled up horribly.  :( Very disappointed."
3.0,Very thin with no underwear built in . Must wear something under them!
3.0,"It's not perfect by any means, but it got the job done.  For reference, I'm 5'6&#34;, 115lbs and chose a small.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- All of the pieces you would need came with this.<br />- It appears to be fake leather, but it looks decent, and is strong enough to hold together.<br />- A really great value considering the complexity of this cosplay piece.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Wow, this is difficult to put on.  They included basic instructions in mine (which is definitely nice!), but the pictures are small, and it's still kind of hard to follow.  I want to reiterate what someone else posted in these reviews, and recommend this video: https://youtu.be/wdit7Wcrdvo.<br />- I had to make some sewing adjustments to get things to sit right.  The belt that is supposed to go across the chest was a good 6&#34; too low for me.<br />- Even though I got a small, many of the belts had too much space.  After finally getting everything situated, I ended up cutting some pieces shorter, so I wouldn't have belt tabs flying everywhere.<br />- Meanwhile, the elastic that goes around your feet felt too short.  I haven't made this change yet, but I will probably need to lengthen it."
3.0,"I bought these to replace similar tanks to layer under sweaters. I liked that they have lace on the top and bottom, but all three had holes where the lace meets the tank. I’m glad I know how to sew so I can fix them, but it’s super-annoying that they are so cheaply sewn that the lace is separating from the tank."
3.0,"There were the right size, but seemed to wide."
3.0,The chain is hideous. The charm is cute.
3.0,"Small, but I managed. Don't order if you're bigger than a size 6."
3.0,"This is a brick red, not a red like the picture, which is what I wanted. It fit fine but I found it a bit itchy"
3.0,Idk if it was the material but I am usually an XL and it did not fit at all it felt more like a LARGE<br />It felt too tight and not long enough.<br />And it was marked XL if you’re going to buy this I suggest go up a size. I did return this.
3.0,It fits really large. I bought a size up and didnt need to. I washed it to see if it would shrink and it doesn't. :( I typically wear a medium/large. I bought an XL. I'm 5'5 130 36d for reference.
3.0,"Smells weird, material is pretty cheap but the sweater does look like the picture"
3.0,Good concept and cool look just a bit on the smaller side. I don't wear out because they are a bit small but I do wear around the house.
3.0,THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP BUT THEY LOOK NICE.
3.0,Event was canceled due to Covid but kept it because it’s so pretty
3.0,"Unfortunately these are kind of a bust. I wore them a few times to the gym but I like a thicker, more compressive workout legging (like Fabletics Powerhold). I will have these on hand as a backup but they're not a favorite of mine."
3.0,The dress looked just like the picture it runs big I’m a curvy hourglass shaped girl I got a large I’m 5’8 160 pounds I could fit two of me in it pretty but will be returning it
3.0,Great hat but HUGE!  i have a medium-sized melon and this beanie with pom was absolutely huge on me.  Maybe it was the color combo?  (blue with black pom)  Sadly I will be returning it.
3.0,Overall these leggings are great. Perfect fit and super comfortable. My only complaint and reason for only three stars is the material is super sheer on the black pair of leggings. I won’t be wearing them outside of the house they’re so sheer. The heathered gray pair isn’t as sheer and would be ok to wear in public.
3.0,They are not the worst but they are very annoying to put on and take off
3.0,I thought the quality wasn’t very good.  But still a cute necklace.
3.0,"The skirt is nice looking. I liked the color and the style. However, I found the material a little itchy and uncomfortable."
3.0,Much smaller than I expected. I gave it to my daughter.
3.0,I was excited to get this and ordered larger because of the look I was going for. Top is shorter and does not run true to size at all.
3.0,Very well made bag. Not a cheaply made bag. Very nice.
3.0,Not the best quality and the zipper is only for show
3.0,"Very small<br /><br />I have small wrists and this was too small to go over my fist. I had to send it back unfortunately. The bracelet was lovely and just as pictured, so was disappointed that I couldn't keep it. Otherwise, would have rated it 5 stars."
3.0,El producto es bueno pero no es Demi medida
3.0,My hips and thighs are  too much woman for this outfit! :0)<br />It would be awesome for the dead of summer.<br />178 lb's<br />34 D<br />5 ft 2 1/2<br />waist 30<br />hips 46<br />I should've ordered up.
3.0,Already did
3.0,The piece came in with one of the stones loose in the bag. Otherwise it’s cute
3.0,Very pretty but much bigger than I thought. I little too big
3.0,Made well and pretty but I was hoping it would be a bit longer. I’m 5’ 2”.
3.0,The latch part that holds the chain together broke off
3.0,The arm holes are too big and the rest of it is tight when I ordered a size up. Not flowy
3.0,"Okay, well I like the style of the jacket but it wasn't as pictured. The picture is vintage in appearance whereas the jacket I received is not at all vintage. Instead the colors are very crisp and vibrant. None of those are negative characteristics but they're not what was advertised and not as pictured for this jacket. I was expecting and was wanting an aged looking jacket. Three stars only because I was misled. However, the jacket fits as expected, is very cute, and it looks nice on in a tank top, a pair of leggings, and ankle high boots."
3.0,The shirt is made of a soft fabric.  The pink color is blush rose pink.  The top is very over sized.  It runs larger than I expected.  It was too large for me so I gave to my neighbor.  The open shoulder is a nice gap and shows just enough skin.  I don't think the fabric is going to wear well through many wash/dry.  I would suggest air drying.<br /><br />I did use a coupon towards my purchase.
3.0,"I like it fits snug and has the buttons on the side for when you wear masks, as this is helpful when you have to wear glasses.<br />I like the cushion they have lined inside on the forehead as it is helpful for when you sweat.<br />I do not like that you have to rig it a little should you not have long hair that can go into a ponytail or bun, so the fit isn’t as snug but it’s still manageable."
3.0,It is made of cheap material because of which the sparkly beads are prone to come out any time. Disappointed with the product.
3.0,"I love the look of it.  It is definitely for someone who has more hair.  Mine is down to my shoulders when it's in a pony tail and I still don't have enough hair to really fill this and keep it in place.  The chain broke off of it on the 2nd use, and the only way to keep the pin in is to thread it through 2 specific holes (look at the front of the picture--there's one of those on each side and if you don't get it through the hole the whole cage slides around).  It is even more difficult to thread once the chain was broken off.  However, I get lots of compliments on it, and have not yet had any rhinestones fall off, which I initially thought would happen."
3.0,"I'm not sure mine are polarized to be honest. Usually when wearing polarized glasses, you can see into water a little bit because glare/reflection/whatever is removed. I take my daughter to the pond to feed the fish and the glare is horrible. They are cute and I've gotten compliments on them, but feel my glasses somehow missed the polarizing process or something. They came in good condition and are cute."
3.0,I love the outfit the material is absolutely wonderful. But the sizing is wrong i ordered a 3x which usually i will thake a 2x but it fit as a large.
3.0,Very good quality but runs too small
3.0,"Plus size fit incredibly small. I wear an 18 and it feels like they're painted on. I guess I'll keep them because they are quite soft without being overly thick/hot, and they're not too long (I'm 4'11""). But it takes a minute to finally get them pulled up..."
3.0,It didn’t have as much support as I was hoping. Loved the style color and pattern though.
3.0,A little flimsy😕
3.0,"Cute bracelet for a girl.  The pink shade was a bit too fake looking, as there was not a fade as you would see in shells naturally.  This is not something you would wear daily due to the finish.  So make sure a slip not is used when tying it."
3.0,"I ordered the grey in size L (I'm 5'2 about 160 lbs and don't have a big chest-36B). It fits a little oversized on me which is what I was going for, I don't like my shirts tight. The color was way off from the picture though. It's more of a very light blueish color, not grey. It's pretty thin and the fit/way it's made is not much like the picture either (not flattering at all). It's soft and comfortable, it's an okay shirt and I can still wear it, but it wasn't what I was expecting and don't think it's worth the price to be honest. Wouldn't buy it again"
3.0,This dress is nos for Americans
3.0,Love the color not sure of the shirt sleeves are long and the body is short
3.0,Purchased as a gift. It was as picture but the length was odd and clasp was hard to operate.
3.0,"Frames seem sturdy, and they look pretty.  Unfortunately, in my state, they're illegal because they cover the lower right corner of the plate, hiding the registration sicker."
3.0,"the pants fit as expected, but they are not a deep solid black. they are a black/brown color in the day light and under most commercial building lighting, meaning i can't wear them to work as solid black pants. a little disappointing i paid $20 for blackbrown -ish pajama pants."
3.0,"I ordered a bigger size because all the reviewers said they sized up because their size were too small and won't fit ,Unfortunately my size would've fit me just right"
3.0,Runs big and not great material
3.0,"This is okay, but the bale is chintzy."
3.0,Fits very big so I guess we'll wait a year or two until she grows in to it
3.0,"I thought that this item wouldn't look so cheep, however I guess it will do for a stocking stuffer<br />Thanks"
3.0,"Thinner than I expected, however it stretches nicely for how thin they are, without becoming see-through. &#34;Good&#34; quality for the price paid!"
3.0,The stitching is itchy
3.0,"This is the second hat i ordered. The first one was perfect fit and smell. This one probably fits fine but there is a smell like the same smell you get if you order an Indian leather product, very strong odor."
3.0,Cute but not for kids. There to big
3.0,I absolutely love this necklace but the chain broke the second time I wore it.  I am super bummed because everyone complimented me on it!
3.0,"Very pretty bracelet. Does not present as tight fit, so sliding/glide function is for the look vice utility.  I hope I don’t lose the bracelet or it get too warped to pull off."
3.0,Very pretty but it wasn't gold filled and I didn't want it to fade so soon
3.0,"But...I washed it and hung it to dry, the black is dull."
3.0,"These were not at all what the pic looked like but does it really ever. They are small for maybe a 2nd or 3rd hole in your ear or even a small child. Unless u r looking dead at them in the center, u won't be able to see the color from the sides. They just look like clear squares on the ear. They kinda feel like a waste of my $$$$$$$$"
3.0,I ordered this for my 11 year old daughter but it fits my 6 year old niece instead. But it's very cute. The fabric used is good for the price. Delivery was okay.
3.0,Doesn't fit as I expected. The material is too thick for summer weather.
3.0,"Beautiful flowers, but the earrings are quite thick, ~1/4"". In the photos they look thin, like they are made with wires."
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these necklaces for my son to wear at his game. I would’ve given them 5 stars but I ordered a navy blue, light blue, and white necklace. I got one navy blue necklace and 1 royal blue necklace. The royal blue doesn’t match his uniform. 🤦🏼‍♀️"
3.0,It's ok I will give away for xmas
3.0,Returned item<br /> Has slits on the sides.  I did not recall reading that in description.<br /> Pockets are not deep.<br /> Bow has not a lot of tail so it looks small<br /> Mine was stained with something<br />I don't like the polyester feel it is stiff<br />Color was vibrant (Blue)<br />Very long.  I'm 5 8 and it hit my ankles
3.0,I went exactly by the size guide to pick the right size but it still seems a bit big even with a heavy sweater and cinching the waist cord tight. quality of the fur was good but the parka had a strong chemical smell which is probably from the coating they put on it. one of the elastic loops that holds the liner to the parka was broken as well. haven’t tried it out in cold or wet weather so i don’t know how warm the parka will be
3.0,"It looks great. Seems to be well made but you can't tell a lot from one wear but... It is short.. really short so don't plan on tucking it in and it has no pockets??? I didn't even think to look, I thought all shirts had pockets. The marbled snap buttons are a great touch."
3.0,"The fit is loose especially on the left lens. The lens clarity and quality are fine but you could spend some time and money on manufacturing, specifically improving your sizing templates/tolerances."
3.0,Too big and do not like the puffy shoulders
3.0,"Super cute but very stiff. I expected it to curve around the head, instead it sticks out"
3.0,"The watch was exact;y what I was lookingfor, but the pin that attached the band to the watch would not stay attached.  Very disappointed!"
3.0,"Nice pants,  but sizing is very small."
3.0,They work.  I bought these as a backup to my safety glass sunglasses.  The comfort is lacking but tolerable.  This is due to the design of the hard nose pieces.  They may work well for another face.  The polarized lens do alter colors and to my surprise show scratches invisible to the unaided eye.  I found this to be more a disadvantage as the scratches it highlights on my screen protector are a distraction.
3.0,Wokrked but watch broke first day when my daughter fell down. One off the wings nrojenof of tic watch.
3.0,"These aren't bad, but they aren't really what I was expecting. Bigger than I was anticipating, which makes them look chunky and fake."
3.0,"These earrings are super cute once you get them on, but that’s very hard to do by yourself. The piece that goes through your ear moves a lot when you’re trying to connect that piece to the other half of the earring. Making it very hard to do. It took me about 5-10 mins just to get one earring on. I hope it gets easier in the future, but you’d almost have to have two people to get it to clasp. It’s very inconvenient. If it wasn’t for that, I would’ve given these earrings a higher review. They have a bit of weight to them, but nothing too bad. For the most part, they’re very light. And I love the way the seem to shine in the light due to the texture."
3.0,"The tutu leotard is well made but way too small for my granddaughter. It’s very narrow. Unfortunately, it’s not going to work out."
3.0,"The stretch out and move around on my head. I have to adjust them multiple times a day. I found something better tho anyway, it's a band that clips on your hard hat with fabric that hangs off the back. This allows air to reach your neck unlike these that are in constant contact with the skin."
3.0,"I have chubby arms and they fit fine. They're not tight at all. My only issues is they come with a smell, that I could only describe as dog pee. What I did notice is that the smell does disappear after a while."
3.0,The ball fell off after the first delicate wash. Hat is very warm and stylish.
3.0,The seams are already coming apart after wearing maybe 3 days. Inside seams and tag very uncomfortable. Helped prevent my hands from swelling. So I will likely use until they completely fall apart.
3.0,"They feel like regular leggings. I ordered these with the intent that they would be warmer, and a standalone garment for winter. They are far from it! they will work as a base layer, or as regular leggings, but they are not thick fleece lined or warm"
3.0,The necklace is kind a small
3.0,"Very cute, but VERY short!"
3.0,Too large for my child’s face. Literally fits his whole face from top to bottom. He is an average six year old. Better for an older kid or even an adult
3.0,"It is very beautiful but it didn't last long.  I did continually use it for about 6 months.. only took it off to shower.  It was never water damaged, I don't have pets or anything either.  About to toss it but wanted to write a review first.  For the price, I would have been happy if it had lasted at least a year."
3.0,To see through very thin material can’t wear it to church if I would have known it was that thin wouldn’t have bought it .. it’s very pretty and fits just perfect just very see through thin material..
3.0,Glass Scratches easily. Very good looking. Somewhat difficult to use its functions. Nedd to read a lot.
3.0,Swish Swish Goes the fabric when you move.<br />Fabric is the shiny / smooth type which makes the swish noise.<br />Fit is TTS<br />Pockets are very low on the bum.<br />Pocket flaps stick straight out. Look like I have duck feathers.<br />I’m returning.
3.0,"We got the black and pink pack in size 7/8 the quality of the fabric is good, the length of the Bermuda shorts is exactly what we expected. The only issue was the pink pair were about 2” bigger in the waist than the black pair although they were both tagged size 7/8. The pink pair is too big but the black pair is what we expected from a size 7/8."
3.0,"The watch looks great but didn't last long. I bought the watch about six months ago. I wore it pretty frequently, probably 3 days a week. I really didn't mind the wind-up mechanism, which you get used to pretty quickly. However, the watch band started deteriorating pretty quickly. The part of the band where I close the strap peeled back to show a matte black lining and what appears to be a white cottony substance. Still, I liked the way it looked, so I kept wearing it. After about six months, the wind-up mechanism stopped working. The watch is now dead, and unlike many watches I can't just have it opened up to put a battery in.<br /><br />All in all, it looked nice, but it definitely didn't last long. Expect to get some compliments for about three months, and then for the watch to stop working at around 6."
3.0,"This dress is pretty big.  I'd say it runs about two sizes too big.  It looks like the picture and is a nice, soft material....I just don't want to wear it because it's so long and huge on me.  (I ordered a small and this fits like a large)"
3.0,"Dress is nice for the price. Unfortunately the headband with feather was missing and it's too late to get, buy or make a replacement."
3.0,Winder works OK. Does not run continually for me so watch does not fully wind.
3.0,"Was planning to wear this charm on an earring, but when it arrived, realized it is only one-sided.  Maybe include this in the item description? Thank you.  Attached photo is the reverse side."
3.0,"I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of this costume.  For the price, the material, stitching, etc. should have been better,"
3.0,"Cute pattern and pretty color, but am going to return because it was not flattering. Im 5 ft 3, 150lbs, 34D. Too much fabric around chest area and too long on me (I got a large). It also had a lot of static which other reviews stated. Wish it had worked!"
3.0,Tighter than I expected. Not soft stiffer fabric
3.0,"I did not received all parts.  I received the backpack, lucnk box and pencil case."
3.0,Not what I had expected but also what I had expected grey quality for the type of hat just small for my head I'm a 7 5/8 and this hat fits small.. looks like one of those river hats u wear on half of your head backwards
3.0,"Very cute.. ordered larger size than normal, still too small."
3.0,"Good if you want something very simple. The color is great. I'm not sure why there isn't a top button though, it looks quite awkward but it works I guess. It's a little small in length, so I couldn't tuck it in my pants without it coming out a few times during the day. I'm 5' and 90 pounds."
3.0,"Comfortable and love the pockets, but keep getting punctures along seams. I purchased these for my first internship for river ecology fieldwork where I have to use them every day. Would not recommend for daily fieldwork use, but would be great for fishing."
3.0,"The description says ""Loose."" These run smaller than expected and therefore were not loose."
3.0,Arms were so tight. My daughter ordered it & didn't tell me until it was too late to return it.
3.0,"This purse was extremely small, fit more for a child than an adult. The pattern is very cute. I have the book bag and was wanting the purse to match."
3.0,Gave as a gift to a senior person and she was happy with yhe product.
3.0,"Normally wear a large, ordered large and the zipper won’t go all the way up.. think my boobs are too big.. will probably keep it anyways since I’m losing weight slowly but surely.."
3.0,Very cheaply made. I got it for a gift for my great niece
3.0,These are just the same size as regular earmuffs which we already had. Sent back because of misleading description. Thought they would be smaller
3.0,"It's a nice pentacle, but the chain it comes with isn't worth a damn. The chain is thin and they don't package it right so it arrived tangled and knotted, which naturally caused the chain to snap while I was trying to untangle and unknot it... so now I have to buy a whole new chain..."
3.0,Quality mask. Great Rat Fink theme print. Takes a looooooooooooog time to arrive. Only buy if you don't need it anytime soon.
3.0,Very cute! But fragile and arrived broken :(<br />Where claw attaches to fishhook is very thin and fragile.<br />Returned.
3.0,Credit card fit really tight
3.0,Bonito el vestido. Me quedo bien
3.0,I wish this shirt gave me an extra small option bc the small was too big and stretchy. I like the different texture of the tank compared to others plus it’s light weight to even wear in the hot summer
3.0,"Its okay, material isn't the best but overall cute"
3.0,note that the girl in the picture is wearing high wasted pants. The shirt actually is pretty short. Y
3.0,"I got these for a septum peircing. 20g is way too thin, it's barely visible and the way my peircing is, 8mm is too tight of a fit. But that's all my fault. It would be good for a nostril peircing or ear cartalige. Very pliable metal. Colors are pretty."
3.0,I didn't realize that the back was adjustable with a buckle type of adjuster. I like everything about it but that because I can feel the bump it causes and it's annoying.
3.0,"This jacket just didn't pan out the way I had hoped.  The fleece was not very soft.  The inner liner was softer than the fleece, but still not great.  The jacket has two deep pockets in the front, a pretty big collar that can be turned up for warmth with a zipper closure.  I usually wear an XL or 1X.  I ordered an XL and would have been happier with a larger size.  The jacket comes down to skim the waist.  Overall, the jacket is warm, but the short waist length style is just not for me."
3.0,I bought this for my soon to be 7 year old and it’s really cute. The material does seem a little thin so I’m curious to see how durable it’ll actually be. It is reasonably priced though for a play out fit. My daughter was really happy to put it on and start playing right away. I’ll update after about a week of wear to see how it holds up.
3.0,Good value for the cheap price. It is waterproof and has decent traction on snow and ice. Not good for long distance walking. The fit is a little sloppy and no arch support.
3.0,Costume jewelry - not for serious silver lovers.
3.0,"Nice enough bracelet for the price. Arrived damaged (broken bead), but not going to bother with a return. Not something that will last long..."
3.0,Would be nice to have the park name on front of it.
3.0,"these are very comfortable socks, and the thickest of all socks i've ever had. unfortunately they're not very long. (& not as long as the pictures show them to be) they reach to 2-3 inches above my ankles. i wont return them and they work okay if i'm wearing long johns (though the long johns are always just about coming un-tucked from the socks) i'll see how they work in the summer with work boots and no long underwear. i expect they wont be usable all summer, because the tops of the boots will rub my bare skin too much.<br />  ...they're perfect with no reservations for wearing around the cool house, on the cold floors, in the winter... much too hot to wear in bed."
3.0,"I followed the size chart and read other reviews to determine my size. I'm 5'8"", 155 lbs and I ordered the Medium. The dress fit but the material was just clingy enough to show every bump from my bra strap and my loose tummy. The waist also hit me about an inch too high. Overall I was impressed with the quality of the dress, especially at the price point. But I returned it."
3.0,Good so farpo
3.0,Too big and too long to fit in a flattering way for my fairly straight sided shape. Seems like a nice skirt otherwise though
3.0,"Cheaply made, started to come apart after a week or so, but looks nice and isn't expensive"
3.0,"I returned it.  It was flimsy.  It did hold my ring, but was not as well made as I was hoping for"
3.0,"Mixed feelings about these .... they are really cute and people always notice them when I wear them, but I have a hard time keeping them on my ear, they aren't very comfortable, and they bend so easily. Several of them were bent when I got them and I've bent the rest just trying to get them in my ear. Oh, and the pearl one looks ridiculous. The pearl is so big it just looks so weird in your ear."
3.0,Prompt delivery. Material is very lightweight but strong. Great color and is comfortable.  Con: There’s no label or markings. My experience was a little agitating. There is a “front” and rear. But I had to put it on to find it. Sounds petty but not really
3.0,I love the color and design but I didn't realize lightweight meant as thin as foil. I mean they are paper light hence they keep kind of twisting and turning.
3.0,I bought 3 sherpa  sweatshirts this fall - this was the flimsiest of the 3.  I like the pattern.  It was actually good sized - bought my normal size not up a size - fits well - even somewhat loose.  It just isn't quality made.<br /><br />But I have a cat and she loves to knead me and I see loose colored threads afterwards with this sweatshirt - I don't see it with others.  I can't see this lasting with or without her help.
3.0,"These are cute, but they were too small for me to put in my septum. Had to return."
3.0,"I was thinking this was a dress… certainly not a dress, but pairs well with leggings. It’s cute but runs small."
3.0,love the color and the material is nice going to keep. wish it had some pockets out side of purse
3.0,"This ring was exactly what I was looking for and priced perfectly. It’s dainty, cute, and actually closes seamlessly. However I can’t wear it. No fault to the company at all, I ordered too small for my big ole nose. Make sure you know the size you need before placing the order. Since it was perfect, came on time, and was well made I have no problem with spending the money on another!"
3.0,"Decent pants, ripped after wearing 4 times."
3.0,A bit strange in proportions. Good on legs but funny upper.
3.0,"The product does not live up to expectations. The fit, and level of comfort does meet expectations created by the description of this shoe."
3.0,"It's a stretchy-spandex-y jersey knit. A little bit shiny. I ordered a medium based on reviews and should have gotten a large. Clingy in the hips, but WAY big on top for me. I am hippy as it is and pockets are placed so as to exaggerate that. Not sure at this point if I am going to keep or not. Took weeks to get to me from China, can't imagine the return process would be easy."
3.0,"Usually I'm a pretty solid large in panties, so went with that for these. Definitely size up! They still fit and aren't uncomfortable but I could've gone to XL very easily.<br />As far as the breath-ability of these, that's great. I work a job where I'm on my feet, walking 15k+ steps for 8-12 hours in the heat (in a factory with no ac and poor ventilation) and get pretty gross and felt that these kept the sweat at bay in my shorts, ha."
3.0,It's colorful and a good fit for the wine glasses.  They are plastic which I like (the wire wine ID rings tend to bend).  I think the plastic could be a bit more high quality and have a bit of heft to it.  It would work for a nice casual get together but would still go with the wite rings for a dinner party.  I received this product for my honest review.
3.0,A little short on my petite 5 year old.
3.0,Beautiful color shirt but was snug even though I got the bigger size. Great value and would def recommend you go up a size or 2 depending on how you like the fit.
3.0,"More dark brown than yellow, they seem flimsy could be a little bigger"
3.0,These are ok. They are good material that seems like they would hold up well. But I have larger calves and they fall down after an hour or so into work. I work in retail management so I'm on my feet all day and I was hoping they would help more as I'm sure they would if they stayed in place.
3.0,"The photos are beautiful, however the product that arrives is very low quality and not the &#34;leather&#34; shown in the photos."
3.0,"The shoes are difficult for my 7 year old grandson to put on by himself.  I have to undo the back strap and top strap for him to get on and strap them back on.  Most of the time he leaves the back strap undone, just leaves it hanging and his feet move back and forth putting wear on his feet from the movement."
3.0,"They work great, but hurt on my nose. The middle plastic. Do t feel till I take them off, but had them on for more then 20min."
3.0,Doesn't fit right for body type--too small in the shoulders. Fabric seems frayed on edges. Will be returning
3.0,Fit great! The bells are VERY wide. Little big but overall cute.
3.0,Maybe my head is just big
3.0,"I dropped a size smaller because the sizing of items purchased prior to this purchase were too large. Unfortunately, the smaller size was also too large. I haven't returned items because I am on the road for extended periods of time for my job and didn't have enough time to do so. This purchase arrived as I was ready to go out on the road again and was short on winter clothing, so, I chose to keep and wear it. I do love the color and the fabric, however, I do wish it fit better."
3.0,They are a higher cut sock at the top
3.0,I didn't care that it tarnish very quickly. Only got use out of it for about a month before I couldn't use it anymore. It turned my wrist green.
3.0,It wasn’t as attractive on as I had hoped but it may be because it was too large. It kind of clung to the wrong places.
3.0,Unfortunately 2 of  the pieces arrived broken. Otherwise would have given a higher rating because most if the pieces were beautiful fir making a wind chime
3.0,"If you like the worn wrinkled look, you will love this shirt - however purchase at least one size larger.<br />I wear a size M for the body fit but a size L for the arm length. I purchased a size L and the sleeves were too short.<br />I understand that Slim Fit means smaller through the body, but why are the sleeves shorter?"
3.0,"Cute bag but like the other reviews, the outside pockets are too small, the lining should be a lighter color and I'm not sure if it's really leather... you get what you pay for! I'll use it but a bit disappointed, can'the understand why the pockets are so small!"
3.0,"Arms were small,."
3.0,The top was small the bottom huge. I feel it may have been sized wrong. Tried on have not used yet as I needed to wash it as it had a very sticky plastic crotch that took quite a while to remove the residue from the suit. Lots of threads not finished properly. I ordered a one piece from the same company I did not have these problems. So far not pleased.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, just a little too big."
3.0,"This dress is nice, but it can with a big hole at the ebottom. I didn’t have time to exchange it since I had a wedding that day, so I sewed up the whole, wasn’t really noticeable because of the float nature of the dress. It still looked great though."
3.0,"I wear an XL, ended up having to order a 4xl for it to fit. It's very cute, a little tight in the shoulders but I still wear it often."
3.0,It is a decent turtleneck but the sleeves were not long enough for me.  The material is more of a Jersey polyester.  Very silky .  Medium weight
3.0,"My daughter loves these jeans, but they shrunk quite a bit after a few washes.  Look more like capris now but she still wears them."
3.0,it was actually really good quality. you should buy it
3.0,"Really cute but one of the earrings is not usable as the post doesn't thread into the back of the earring, so I really only got one I could use."
3.0,Good for fashion not good for the BDSM play.
3.0,"This is a cute bag, but didn't seem very sturdy to me. Great purple color!"
3.0,Pretty necklace but I do t understand how to fasten it around  my neck. Plus it’s not as long as I thought it would be.
3.0,I ordered a similar style dress from another vendor for about $20 more and I greatly prefer the more expensive dress. First of all the waist drawstring on this one is just a tie sewn on the front of the dress - there’s no working drawstring. The waist line is too short for me - it hits above my natural waist and looks odd from the front and the back. I like the length which is just at the top of my knees. The color isn’t true red but more like brick red.  I’ll probably try to return it because it’s just not flattering on me - fit or color.
3.0,"First I’d like to say the product was beautiful when I received it, however I’ve had it on my keys for less than a month and it’s already chipping. For almost $20 a keychain I’d expect higher quality. I gave it 3 stars because it’s exactly what I wanted but the quality is lacking."
3.0,"These are nice gloves but the lining drys out my fingertips. I don't know what it is but every time I wear them, my hands are super dry and chapped for days after."
3.0,Says “XXL” but fit snug.
3.0,"This dress is an extremely flattering fit, however, VERY see through. After I had washed it for the first time,  I hung it to dry and could see clear through it. (Not like a sheer, but full light and could make out objects behind it) It didnt seem too see through while on, as long as it's a low lighting situation.  It did tend to creep up while walking but it's long enough that it wasn't a big deal. Very comfy too."
3.0,Cute shirt and fits as expected. But it ripped after the first wash.
3.0,These fit smaller than expected even compared to other skinny jeans
3.0,"This is a nice ultra-light athletic jacket with many nice features, just be aware of its limitations.  This is not a do-everything jacket.  It is very light weight and compressible, but also lacks any real warmth in serious conditions.  The entire side of the jacket, including inside of arms is one big stretch panel, which is great for movement, but it also leaks heat like a sieve.  At the first sign of real cold or real wind, the jacket requires a wind proof layer over it, or a more insulating layer underneath.  Like I said, I do like the jacket, and am glad I got it.  It is a great active-wear layer to have, I just always keep my rain pants, rain jacket, and warm vest with me so I can make adjustments as needed.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-light<br />-compressible (rolls up into the hood)<br />-hood is nicely implemented, keeps the neck warm (though face opening is not adjustable)<br />-looks good<br />-very flexible and stretchy, does not hinder movement at all<br />-adjustable bungee around waist seals out cold<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />-stretch side panel material is too thin and provides little warmth<br />-hood face opening is not adjustable (when elastic stretches over time it will no longer seal out cold) A light bungee with cord lock would be a nice addition)"
3.0,"I bought it because can't find my winter gloves. Just needed something to help me get through the last few cold spring days in New England. It's not the warmest gloves for freezing temperature. It's actually terrible when it's windy because it doesn't have an interior lining to stop the freezing wind. It's decent looking and probably good for California winter, but inadequate for New England winter."
3.0,"This is a good set of rings, but the gauge is super tiny compared to the one I got pierced with. I tried to look into the gauge but it doesn't say anywhere on the description and there's no good comparison in the comments"
3.0,"Material was see thru but other then that it was a nice dress , we bought 3 as bridesmaids dresses"
3.0,"Fabric is thick polyester. Not really suitable for hot summer weather. I'd love it if it were a lighter fabric. It's also not a midi, it skins the top of my knee and I'm 5'7&#34;."
3.0,"Love this look, the top fit true to size, the bottoms ran smaller so had to return"
3.0,"These were okay, maybe -- but I decided not to keep them. I was looking for a pair of pants for dance class, but these pants didn't allow for enough split/straddle flexibility. They're definitely stylish, and the material and fit make them flattering and normcore-hip. But I don't think they're fitted very well -- when I put them on and placed them just so, everything looked good. But as soon as I moved around, the material around the hips rode up and I got that weird bunching that happens at your leg joints that basically just creates a diaper-like V from your hips to your crotch. It wasn't cute anymore, is my point.<br /><br />The pockets were a bit shallow for me. The length is definitely intended to be cut off, and I wasn't really looking for that. I thought maybe that being short meant these pants would fit me longer, but surprisingly these were cut off on me, too.<br /><br />Anyway, it looks like these pants worked really well for some people, but it wasn't what I was looking and didn't work on me. I tried the size small and am 5'2&#34; and 119lbs."
3.0,"I wanted to love these, the fabric feels wonderful. The fit is form fitting but not constrictive, very comfortable. However, the inseam is almost 34"". That is crazy. Because they are a knit and flared at the bottom there is no simply rolling them up and hemming a knit is a pain. For the price I'm not going through all that. So I will be returning. Bummer :(<br /><br />Also, it says to handwash and hang dry. Ugh.<br /><br />I've never ordered a pair of pants that came this long, so unless you are TALL these are going to pool on the floor around your feet."
3.0,"This is a solid metal shoe horn.  Works great, but right out of the box the paint began to chip off. The images are from only using it three times. I hope this is just a fluke. But it is not little chips, but large chips of paint.  Just handling the shoe horn caused the paint to come off.  And as the paint flakes off it leaves a mess."
3.0,"Cool looking bag, I get many compliments on them when I travel."
3.0,Beautiful but quite small.  Also turns me blue like a Smurf.
3.0,I like these but I'm going to have to sew them smaller because I didn't size down. Definitely worth the price and works as expected.
3.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I do love the glasses. I get so many compliments on them (when I do wear them), and other than an overall cheap feeling (I feel like they'll break in my hands) they're pretty great!<br /><br />That aside, if you're like me and have any kind of reaction (hives, rash, skin turning green, etc.) these glasses aren't for you unless you want to buy those plastic covers for the arms. I've had to stop wearing them because I ended up with a red, raised bumps along the back of my ear. I should have known better because it's a condition that I've had my whole life with certain metals and materials, so that's on me. Still, be sure to double check before purchasing."
3.0,This tote appears to be smaller than I thought.  I can't really tell if it is made of genuine leather or not.  Returned it.
3.0,"The cosplay came in pieces. The headpiece was broken and the socks were not included. The only thing included were the gloves, dress, and earrings. The cosplay itself is well made but it was too small on me."
3.0,"It is pretty, but it is too big acording with the sizing chart."
3.0,It is as tiny as the picture!
3.0,"a little loose, and I'm a pretty big guy, I'm very glad I am not a small person or it would be baggy on me. I took in the seams by hand and it fits much better now."
3.0,"It’s a nice hat. The quality of the material seems satisfactory. However, I need a hat that fits at least a size 7 1/2 head. This hat has a the plastic snap adjustment on the back. I’ve got it out to the very last hole and it barely fits."
3.0,Looks good but flimsy
3.0,"I got this product for my son’s gym/tumbling class to use when it starts getting cold. This tight fit but the foot hole for the convertible is too small, I had a hard time getting my small fist through it, not to talk of a foot. I didn’t even try it because I didn’t want it to snag the tights.<br />I’m hoping that the company sees this comment and offer a replacement that is guaranteed has large foot hole if not I’ll be calling amazon or requesting a refund through the app. Thanks"
3.0,One fell out of the prongs
3.0,"Comfortable, strong fabric, but it rides up above the waist. Can't even cover my crotch and buttocks."
3.0,To large and cut to low in the chest area
3.0,squeezed it on to wear once and it was cute but so small and cheapish
3.0,Was cute but it was looser on me then it was supposed to be.
3.0,"This grid organizer seems to be a popular way of organizing your electronics. The size I ordered measures 8 1/2 x 12 1/4 &#34;.<br /><br />Pros: As described, it consists of a set of interlocking bands. These allow for a good deal of flexibility for the devices you include - I can secure an external hard drive, but also cords.<br /><br />Cons: On the other hand, the bands are a bit loose, and as a consequence, items with more bulk like a mouse or some laptop power adapters fit into the bands, but easily fall out. There is a zip pocket on the back, but it is so tight to the board that you really can't fit anything in there except perhaps a sheet or two of folded paper, or some id cards. The board that is used to give it some stiffness is quite heavy for a tech case.<br /><br />Ultimately, this works ok hanging on my wall to organize cables, but if your priorities are organizing a variety of electronics, or having a lightweight carry bag for your digital nomadism, you might want to try something else."
3.0,"I always order large in tops but this one drowned me - it felt like it was 2XL! The sleeves went past my fingertips, and it was approx 4"" too big around my chest (which is the main reason I have to wear a large size top normally). Perhaps the one I received was mis labeled but I would hesitate to order another due to this outrageous sizing."
3.0,"I've been looking for weights for a while and after looking at these reviews, I thought I may have found the perfect ones. Unfortunately that wasnt the case. My lobes are stretched to 25mm (1 inch) and they were too heavy for me within an hour and a half- 2 hours. My lobes were FREEZING, meaning that they weren't getting much of any blood flow. I flipped them over my ear for the rest of the day, as I had nothing else to wear, so these are really just good for short periods of use- like out for a dinner or something, but not a whole day out"
3.0,It wasn’t as nice as I expected it to be.
3.0,Beautiful pattern but fits much smaller and tighter then expected.
3.0,"Bought these as a gift, for the price I would rather there not be chunks or gouges in the leather. I completely understand it can’t be perfect, just a little frustrating. But arrived quickly, so if I wasn’t being picky, 5 stars. Also came in a recyclable bag."
3.0,"Size: I  ordered a large due to the reviews I read, usually I wear a US 6-8. My bust is a 32 b and that area of the blouse fits fine. The length is adequate too as it sits right below my waist (I am 5'4'). If you wear a small I'd suggest a medium and if you wear large I suggest going two sizes up.<br /><br />Texture: It has a sort of papery fabric but it is thick enough because I will wear mine to work, to be safe I'll add a camisole but it is definitely not see through. The pearl beads are also neatly aligned and the shoulder has a nice detail.<br /><br />Fit: The blouse is square, thus, that neat cut out on the model -especially the sides- is not what you will see when you try this top. The blouse looks totally boxy and that is the only fault I really find. I will have a tailor adjust mine so it looks more fitted at my stomach area.<br /><br />The shipping took ten days so that is not bad since it is coming from China. A picture is attached for better aid."
3.0,"Genuinely torn with this hoodie because it fits well and is made from great quality cotton. The inside of the hoodie is amazingly soft, but I can’t speak on whether it’ll stay soft or shrink after washing...<br /><br />That being said, the hoodie did NOT come as pictured. The “Heather Athletic Maroon” is displayed almost with a vibrant red hue, but unfortunately arrived more purple than anything. I’m dissapointed in this company’s inability to display the correct color schemes on Amazon.<br /><br />I most likely won’t be returning this hoodie purely out of not wanting to deal with the haggling, however don’t recommend purchasing any colors that could potentially arrive in incorrect colors."
3.0,It was loose fitting. I suggest ordering a size down
3.0,My daughter loved these however they ripped with a few days of wear :(
3.0,Not long enough for me.
3.0,"I didn't read the material it was made out of, thought it was cotton my fault I didn't read the description."
3.0,Wish this would of fit right.  I have big boobs so it just didn’t work.
3.0,The scrubs are great. I hate the undershirt though. It is very cute but the stars are just glued on and come off very easily and are stiff so they are a little annoying on the skin.
3.0,The abalone inlay looks like it is just a glued on sticker or something. They look nice from far away though
3.0,"How unfortunate that it is see-through on the backside. From the front it isn't, and I actually liked it. But, I can't be walking around with my butt showing. Also it smelled really bad... I would think a wash would take care of that, but I'm returning anyways. Just an FYI!"
3.0,Cute top fits well colors are not as shown
3.0,Is small for sure 8lb baby or more to small. It shipped to me by accident and I had to go mail it. I ordered several items to be shipped and this one was the only one sent to me? Looks to be made good and not cheap. Name was well put on.
3.0,"The white bracelet has sparkling crystals, strong clasp and looks better, in my opinion, as a necklace. The bracelet will not fit comfortable on a wrist larger than 7.5&#34;. Unfortunately, the gift box does not look as those I saw in the online pictures or at the other reviewers, so I have to use a different box, larger, and nicer for gifting."
3.0,Cooler backpack. Looks good keep stuff decently cold but leaks like a sieve
3.0,"The belt looks good, but don't know why the manufacturer decided it to be so narrow. I have two other elastic belts, this one at least a quarter of an inch narrower, making it a bit uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,average belt nice buckle.  Quick deivery
3.0,Really tight socks.  Like the colors but they are almost like compression socks.  Not crazy about that.
3.0,"Ok fit for the price. However, a little big around the shoulders if the child is petite in size."
3.0,The fit a bit snuggg
3.0,"I've had this fleece for a few months now. It looks like the picture. I find it incredibly comfortable to wear. It's snuggly and warm. I really love the dark green color i got. The one complaint i have is the way it is made because of the fabric.  In my opinion, It's not a simple quick wash and throw it in with casual stuff, toss in the dryer. The tag is not very clear with instructions and information. It says polyester (I assume it is only polyester and nothing else) and it says to wash with darks separately. I normally would not put anything pure polyester in the dryer, tag says that's ok?<br /><br />I put it in the largest delicate bag i have, wash it on delicate cycle (w other delicates) and hang it to dry. Maybe i'm making it more difficult? I just don't normally put polyester items in the dryer. It takes two days to dry because it's so thick. I wish it was made not with polyester.<br />Other than a lack of clear instructions and fabric choice, I do like the fleece and will wear it more this upcoming Fall/winter."
3.0,"Good at first, but after a few washes it’s looking old and very worn"
3.0,One of the bands broke where it clicks in the watch as soon as i worn it within a couple of days of use.
3.0,Loved the colors. The stitching was poorly done. Easy to wash.
3.0,Not much room in the chest! If your busty may want to order something else with more room up top… After washing the same grows across my breast area !<br />Do not put in the dryer! :-) Otherwise very soft and perfect for less bustier woman :-)
3.0,"It's super cute! But when I opened it I found that the straps were not attached. It appeared that they were glued at one point. Half of the lining was off as well. I pulled out my glue gun to fix it all. Normally, when I buy a purse I like to not have to perform surgery to fix it. But the purse is super cute, which is why I kept it!"
3.0,"Happy to see it arrive; but, a bummer when put on. It is a nice length BUT made of thin fleece, rather baggy for an XL and has no zippered pockets (as on Amazon Basics or Columbia.) Perhaps the brand name Land's End was purchased by  a Chinese corporation and then design/fabric quality suffered?<br />I'll give it away, and never order from this ""Land's End"" again. For affordability and substantial quality and detailing, I'll stick with Amazon Basics.<br />C'est la guerre."
3.0,"I think this yarn is too scratchy. It seems very popular among knitters tho so maybe it is just picky me. I would not wear it next to my skin. If I wouuld not wear it, I would not gift something made out if it."
3.0,Super yellow. Looks super fake in comparison to another I bought from a different vendor.
3.0,"I purchased these pants in a size medium and the fit was ok (athletic build, 5’1” 125 lb) but the pants are super unflattering. The elastic band is very thick and comes up too high above my natural waist to accentuate the thinnest part. Also the front pleating detail puffs out in a way that doesn’t look great. Even though the pants are really comfortable, I’ll be returning them because it just wasn’t the look I was going for. Quality seems fine though."
3.0,This runs small and it wasn’t worth the price.
3.0,It's cute and came in on time. I read reviews about how it's made and decided to buy the XXL to be safe but it was too small across my chest area. I'm not sending it back because my daughter can wear it.
3.0,the button to show the time is hard and extremely  annoying to press it every time you need to know the time.
3.0,Was sad to return it. Way to small need XL for a 11 year old but I don’t know? Or think they have it??
3.0,"If it had a zipper! Very sad about how difficult the corset is. I don’t have time to find help trying this on, or for the wedding. It took too long to figure out…other than that, it’s also RED RED… not wine red. I should have gotten burgundy."
3.0,Like like you’re wearing two left shoes
3.0,I typically wear a large or XL in junior sizing & the large in this shirt is too big. Not too big to send back but I will be taking it in a bit for a better fit. Material is similar to that of a sports jersey. Cute but not exactly what I was expecting.
3.0,"Very cute, but very short and slim. Will only cover the shin on my petite 3 year old niece. Doesn't even go up to her knee. And she is very petite for her age."
3.0,The rim is not nearly as wide as pictured so the hat looks like a fishing hat and not a beach hat
3.0,"Update:  I received a replacement belt because my first belt had a screw come loose and fell off.<br /><br />Pro:  I list the sleek style of the belt.  It's just as it appears on the pictures in Amazon.  The size is right and it feels comfortable.  Additionally, the customer service from Maikun Brands was very responsive when I had an issue.  Based on their prompt response and willingness to resolve my issue, I would recommend buying from them.<br /><br />Con:  My first belt's buckle broke.  The buckle is attached to the leather belt by 2 screws.  One of the screws came loose and fell off.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice until later and wasn't wasn't able to locate the missing screw.  This left the belt useless. I had only used the belt a few times."
3.0,"Be careful wearing this for more than a few hours, will turn your neck green."
3.0,"def helpful for packing, but 2 bags tore within use for the 2nd time."
3.0,Its Okay. Its cheap and it works in keeping my shades around my neck while snorkeling. I would prefer a bright neon color but for the price I cant complain.
3.0,These glasses seem like they're made for a young child.  They're cute but I wouldn't buy again
3.0,Beautiful but vey heavy.  I had to return them.
3.0,"Good, but slighty hairy and a little itchy."
3.0,Although the dress was beautiful the color was more like a baby blue than silver! And I need a true silver color gown!
3.0,Bought for 2 month old . Fit more on the smaller side socks kept coming off
3.0,quality not the best.  stiff material
3.0,the white spots are messy and need to be fixed with white paint. good for the price and cute nonetheless. good size and quality
3.0,"Material is okay, not as soft or stretchy from another vendor I ordered a similar item from, but I was able to give this to my daughter."
3.0,It fit smaller than I anticipated.
3.0,My son is 10 years old. I ordered 12-14 size but it was too tight.
3.0,I had to return this top because it was too big . I am upset because I bought it on a daily deal and could not get a replacement smaller size for that price.
3.0,"So these clearly aren't meant for my body type. I got them because the hotter weather here was causing some chafing while out walking and using the treadmill. I thought maybe these would help prevent that and I could get away with wearing them under some looser pants or under my running shorts. That didn't work out at all. These are pretty restricting and I suggest you size up. I liked the length of them because they fit longer on my short body. Unfortunately, they caused me pretty bad reflux each time I tried to wear them, because they were too restricting at the top. Also the bottom didn't exactly stay put. I won't be wearing these until I've slimmed down another 10 lbs. The material feels nice despite that and I like the pocket."
3.0,Tosmall I got wrong size
3.0,I love the color and size but one of the outside zippers doesn’t close so I can’t use it. I can’t return as I just used it for the first time and past 30 days :-( so check it out when you first get it.
3.0,Very odd. Looks like you are wearing something inside out
3.0,"Cute, but it’s not really as large as they purport. Had to return because it didn’t fit. If you have an average sized head, but the large & you’ll be satisfied with the fit."
3.0,"I do love these head scarfs, but I ordered a pink and a yellow one (this is) and both colors do NOT match the picture. They are more of a baby pink and a very light yellow (they are very close in color) and that disappointed me. They are very nice head scarfs though. Very soft, long, and wide. They are my favorite I just wish the colors were more accurate hence the 3 stars."
3.0,"The instructions are not in English but lucky for me I have used similar products in the past. The stitching between the rows of ""beads"" does not stand up to excess water absorption"
3.0,"The picture they show conveys it’s a thick soft material, but it’s more like a bed spread easily wrinkled material. That being said I’m going to try to steam it and still wear it because it does have nice features."
3.0,Color fades when washex
3.0,I'm normally a large and so I ordered a xlarge after reading reviews... it still is a little small. I have a short torso but this swimsuit seems to be shorter in that area so it feels and looks a little too small..
3.0,"So this dress has a weird fit. The under slip is loose, but the outside lace is stiff with no stretch."
3.0,"I like it, but it's my fault I bought a small. I should have got a bigger size! But I was stubborn and thought it wasn't going to work but this works amazing and fits tight. I had a lot of struggle while hooking it. It looks nice and gives me an hourglass but it's difficult to move and breathe in. If only my waste was this small...I might have to order again."
3.0,These look good on my wife.  Ran a little smalle so go a size up.  The material doesn't feel cheap and they look exactly like the picture.
3.0,I think they are plastic.
3.0,It claims made for 4-12 age of kid. My petite 10 year old feels tight to wear. Very thin material. Doubtfully about the protection. I ordered pink color but received orange.
3.0,"The print and colors are great, held up to wash and dry. This looks like a sweat shirt in the pic, but it’s really just a thin long sleeve shirt. That aside, the pants are bigger than the shirt which is great for my kiddo who uses cloth/reusable diapers."
3.0,"Leggings are good quality. But tight.  And fortunately I'll wear with boots because they are not ankle length for my 5'6&#34; height, 115 lbs w long legs. I got a size SMall"
3.0,Seller didn't have a size & never responded to inquiry. Earrings are huge! Almost gawdy but sparkly
3.0,"Didn’t care for fabric. But, that’s just me, someone else might like it."
3.0,"This suit was not flattering on me at all, so I returned it."
3.0,Fabric is thin and wrinkles very easily.
3.0,"This watch is beautiful and very nice for the price. You shouldn't be expecting a precision timepiece for this kind of price range, and you will need to set it every few days.<br /><br />Realistically this is a piece to wear for special occasions to keep time for a night, not to wear as a daily timepiece."
3.0,"Pretty, but has a strange metal smell."
3.0,"A little big around pocket area, but nice otherwise"
3.0,Just a weird fit and color.
3.0,The material is pretty rough and the scarf is longer than I expected
3.0,"They appear to be well made and keep your feet warm which I like, so I'm giving them 3 stars for that. The platform is too high for me and I've rolled my ankle about 3 times. I have young kids and need to be able to move quickly, I don't feel safe doing so while wearing these slippers. I also don't feel that they've really helped relieve the pain I have from plantar fasciitis like other slippers I've owned."
3.0,"Unfortunately I was sent the wrong size, i ordered the plus size ones (pack of 4) but received one size fits all (which is not true). Tried them on and i look like im wearing a see through sausage casing. Love how soft they are and im sure they wouldn't be see through if they weren't stretched to the max."
3.0,"I want to love this dress, but the fabric is so thin that in some lights you can see straight through it."
3.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Fits like a pj not impressed
3.0,Made of a swimsuit type material. The print is quite nice and bright.<br />Overall though not the biggest fan
3.0,"They feel soft and thick enough, my biggest complaint is getting 3 of exactly the same color, not a variety as advertised. These are a gift for my daughter and I was very disappointed."
3.0,The necklaces are cute but they are not stainless steel as advertised. One of the crystals was missing from the squirrel necklace as well.
3.0,Cheap quality but exactly as described
3.0,Love the style fits nicely but first time wearing it and it ripped :( now I have to sew it back up.
3.0,"The shirt fits perfectly, but the legs of the shorts are too tight.  The waste fits perfectly, but the legs are tight.  Not good"
3.0,"The dress was sewed very poorly. There are areas at the bottom of the dress that are bunched up together, areas where the seam is tangled up, and even areas where the seam isn’t even there. There aren’t super noticeable issues, but it is still frustrating - plus now the dress will be more prone to getting damaged in the washing machine."
3.0,"They are not lasting in my opinion,  they are starting to wear on the heal and toes"
3.0,"I wish I could leave 3.5 stars, because this is a comfortable ring that my husband likes to wear when he is active or during the summer when his fingers are swollen from heat.  We bought the bronze color and it looked great for a week or so, but the color morphed into a purple/mauve color instead of bronze.  Not sure what caused this, but he now has a purple ring.  Not a fan of the purple, but we like the comfort of the ring.  Just wish it would have maintained its appearance."
3.0,"Recieved the Black Cowhide purse. It is very nice and good quality. I was surprised how small it is. Sometimes I don't like to carry my larger purse, so if I'm just going to the casino or to the movies I can put the important items into it and then I won't have to carry the heavy one."
3.0,Cheap metal and turns skin color. Priced appropriately.
3.0,I really liked the necklace until it turned my neck green:/
3.0,"It's an pretty nice hate, seems pretty well made but the fur is a bit cheap.<br />My problem was the fit. Description says one size fir all and 20-27 inch. I have a 23 3/4 inch dome and it's tight. Tight enough I would never be able to wear it for any extended length of time. I can throw it on to run the trash out or something similar but it starts getting uncomfortable within a few minutes.<br />It's pretty warm though so if I had a smaller grape I'd be a happy camper."
3.0,Great idea. I’m the bag started to fall apart as I was using it but it’s still usable. Show compartment is a good idea but sometimes more of a pain in the butt to try to get the shoes in. Make sure to pack your shoes first then the rest of your items. It’s also a small bag so I don’t know if I would have room if I needed to put stuff in their if I was taking a shower at the gym and my clothes. I use it to quickly change and go to the gym.
3.0,Fabric quality not as it seems in the picture.
3.0,"I love the style of this and the way it looks, but the stripes for the sleeves at the bottom aren't knit in; they're sewn. That means you can feel where they've been sewn on, which is a bit aggravating to my sensitive skin (I have scars on my arms that the seams rub). I got this one larger than my normal size because I like to wear things loose, but I can see how ordering in your own size might make the arms pretty tight. Definitely designed for smaller, Asian girls in mind. Or anyone with a build similar, really. Minus the seams, the fabric is comfortable and easy to clean. Not too thick, so you can wear it as a regular indoor shirt or under another jacket. If it weren't for the seam and arm width problem, it would have had a 5."
3.0,"My hands stay so cold, mostly in the winter but sometimes in the spring and fall. These are very comfortable and warm. The only problem that I have is that, although they say you can use your cell phone and other touch electronics, I can't seem to get it to work. After tapping several times, it sometimes will work, but I normally have to remove the gloves to operate my cell or kindle. I still love them for myself, but the makers should work on this aspect of them since they are advertised for it."
3.0,"super cute, and I like the mesh and they slide on easy, but they do run large.  ordered an 11, my daughter is a 10 1/2.  also the sock lining doesnt stay in so thats a downside for me."
3.0,Not bad they do the job and look nice only theres not alot of tummy control
3.0,"Honestly, I fell in love with this ring when I first saw it on sale. I quickly ordered it, but to my experience,  it is not too suitable for POC noses. :( I wish it were a little larger to have a snug fit, as this is too small compared to other rings."
3.0,"I like the looks, but they do not fit snug and secure. Always feel like they will fall off or I will walk right out of them. I did trip once."
3.0,"When they trimmed the end of the belt, the heat knife that cut the radius. Left raised edge on both sides of the belt. These edges cause some difficulties inserting the end and extracting it from the buckle. The vendor should have removed these edges."
3.0,Cute bracelets.
3.0,The are exactly as shone and fit all type of stems.<br />You have to put the cord behind your ear when  you use them' with<br />sunglasses  over  regular glasses. r ===
3.0,Very thin leather.
3.0,"This was a cheap suit I wore to a murder mystery party. The fabric is quite thin and I can’t imagine someone actually wearing this as a legit suit. It arrived on time and while the jacket was a bit small the pants were actually not that bad (except being very thin, almost see-through). The pants could be given more room in the crotch and butt though."
3.0,A lot of the hats broke while we put them together because the tabs did not line up. The other half had the tabs keep slipping out while wearing them. But the print was cute
3.0,I love the look of the watch but unfortunately it almost slides of my wrist.  I wish it was adjustable so it can have a better fit.
3.0,"This is a great skirt but it smells like fish... like it is actually made of fish nets. I soaked it in a tub of laundry soap and have it hanging outside to air out, hoping that will take away the smell."
3.0,I ordered up as per the reviews. I am a US 43 DDDD by measurement but ended up getting 50DD.  It fits okay.  Wish I could try them on in a brick and mortar store first as I might get a better fit.  I am not in love with these bras but I can see how they would offer good support for many with five hooks  I am wondering if I should have just gotten the 50D instead.  I like these bras better than the smooth cup ones  that I also bought which seem to gape a bit more.
3.0,"just ok, too large to wear out in public"
3.0,"Love the look of them. Unfortunately, I have to send them back. Because when I tried them on for the very first time, the left ear piece came off in my hand. They may have been put together to tightly, because opening them was a walking on eggshells experience, which resulted with the left ear frame coming apart above, in the center of the left lens."
3.0,"Worth the price, sparkling and pretty, nice size, would be good as a gift or just a special inexpensive reward to self."
3.0,"This was purchased as part of a costume, it's thin knit, not for someone with a big noggin. Fits a bit too snug."
3.0,Pictures are. It accurate. They are flimsy.
3.0,I pull at the top constantly.. The shoulders doesn't lay as I wish it would and the waist rides up.
3.0,Wish the gloves were the correct blue and gold. Not sure why they can’t make them the actual color.
3.0,it was what I was looking for but bigger than I thought. Wanted to carry it on my keys but its 3x as big as the ones people carry around.
3.0,"It's really cute but it runs small. Had trouble with the how tight it is on my legs. The top covered my top fine (odd for running small) but the strap pulled off with minimum effort. It's super cute though. I usually wear a size medium, so a large might fit better."
3.0,"The fit is snug but it passes.  I feel like this dress just didn't do much to be flattering to ME. It's just a dress in my eyes. Don't get me wrong, I was complimented heavily wearing this dress to worship service today but for me it's just meh. The quality of the dress is decent."
3.0,Nice but breaks way to easily for the price
3.0,"brim is much wider than expected, I'm sure not due to false advertising, just due to me missing that info."
3.0,Cute but really big!!
3.0,The shirt is not the best quality. Multiple seams  are not straight. In general for what I paid I still wear it. Just be prepared for some flaws in the shirt.
3.0,I wanted to give this 5 stars so badly! It’s super cute! Unfortunately the flamingo head will not inflate. I am going to try to possibly stuff the head with some light weight material so that it will at least appear full and not just hang. I tried to rubber band the ankles and pulled the waist as tight as possible but still unable to fill the head. When I tried pushing air into the head it would leak out. So I’m not sure if their is a leak somewhere along a stitched area.
3.0,"I purchased this robe to use at the hospital after c-section delivery.  I also purchased 2 other robes through Amazon which were about double in price (The Jockey Women's Robe Black $33 and Motherhood Bump in the Night Henley Nursing Nightgown And Robe $30) which I will compare in this review in case you are trying to decide between multiple robes.<br />Quality:  This robe has about the same thickness as the other two robes however the fabric is not as soft as either of the other two. The stitching and wear of the fabric is comparable to the other robes.<br />Design:  This robe does not skim the body as nicely as the others so it is not as flattering.  Depending on your preference this robe ties much lower than the other two robes (about 7 inches lower than the Jockey).  It ties at the hip area if you are using the loop holes. The other robes tie at the upper waist area which I personally feel is more flattering and gives better coverage.  The belt for this robe is not sewn on like the other two, I personally prefer them sewn on, but for the price difference I think it is a fair trade off. This robe also does not have an inner tie like the other robes to help keep it closed so I find myself partially exposed and having to readjust it if I am wearing it around the house.<br />Fit: I purchase all three robes in a small (this robe was labeled as US small China Large, the bag said small the tag said large which was what I expected I consider it to be the same size as the other robes which are US sizes) This robe is shorter and more narrow  from side to side than the other robes.  This robe also shrank considerably more after washing, I bought the 2 pack so I washed one right away and measured it shrank 3 inches in length after 1 wash in warm water.  After washing it was about 4 inches shorter than the Jockey and about 2-4 inches more narrow depending on where you measure as the contours are different.  I personally find this robe to be too short for everyday use. To give you an idea, I am only 4 ft 10 in tall.  This robe barely covers below my butt.  The other robes are modest enough I could wear check the mail or when people came to visit the baby.  This robe is not.  Overall I would probably not purchase again because of the length.  If you are shorter than I am you may consider it a good purchase for the price."
3.0,Buttons do not stay closed.
3.0,Very cute watch. However the dial was very difficult to read.
3.0,Standard bandanas with the print in the fabric last longer and require less ironing.
3.0,Nice top but colors a little too busy for me.  Nice material and feels good on.  I will wear it but not my favorite.
3.0,too expensive for quality!
3.0,"This pen takes getting used to.  It does give very crisp lines and I like it a lot.  You need patience, must write slow and break it in.  You have to hold it exactly where the flow of ink comes in or it skips.  I still think it is a high quality pen for the practice of calligraphy and I'm glad to have it."
3.0,Pretty top just runs super small very cropped.
3.0,"This Item just wasnt for me. It looked good. Well made sturdy design<br />There must me a difference in sizing<br />The Item I recieved was a woman;s style( I ordered a male style)<br />Patches were well done, I wish I could have kept it"
3.0,Was a gift. Has not been given yet. I was pleased.
3.0,It's bulky and not comfortable
3.0,"material is not good for dying, made me look sus"
3.0,I like the bag good quality it's just bigger than I thought
3.0,"I love the shirt, but the sizes run WAY small. I bought a 3X because I like a loose fit, but this one is tight on me."
3.0,"I'm a lady with big arms and have to cover tattoos for nursing school. These are literally the only sleeves that have come close to fitting well, but they're still tight. I had to return them because they became transparent when worn."
3.0,"If you are busty, be warned.  This lays very weird across your bust.  The picture looks great and I've bought other dresses in this style that look great.  This just isn't one.  It is also sized smaller than U.S. dresses.  I had to return it the first time I received it and then I ordered it two sizes bigger than I usually wear and it was still a little tighter than I like.  To be fair, I have trouble buying dresses because I am very blessed, so I have trouble getting a size that isn't tight in the bust, especially from overseas.  This dress was too cute for me to pass up at least trying though.<br /><br />The company is great with returns though, so if it doesn't work out for you, there is no hassle on the returns.  I think that is something that the company should be proud of and receive credit for - hence the 3 stars.<br /><br />So while this dress didn't work out for me, it is still worth a try, which is why I gave it 3 stars."
3.0,"Neckline is not as pictured. Arms fit weird. Fabric is comfortable,  length is good. Almost"
3.0,Liked at first the heel is to slippery I fell down stairs
3.0,"baggy in legs, good waist fit"
3.0,"Necklace not worth the price. Pretty, but will probably change color.  It's actually silver toned just like the picture depicts but in the ad it says gold."
3.0,Haven't worn the necklace  yet - will probably put it in the costume box.  For the price I should not have expected it to look like much.
3.0,"I purchased this shirt in a medium which is my normal size for shirts. The color (grey) and material were nice, but even with the stretch in the material, it was too tight around my upper arms. Since the body of the shirt fit well, I don't think a larger size will fit properly. This would be good for someone who doesn't have weight in their upper arms though."
3.0,Some of the necklaces broke before I could even try them on
3.0,"It's ok, looks better in the picture....bubbles are not as noticeable but the white does make it POP.  Not bad but not what I expected."
3.0,"Adorable, does not have the shape of the dress pictured- that shape could be achieved if you wore it over a crinoline.  The dress was slightly big in the torso for the length, if your kid is a skinny Minnie you would need to take it in to get that length in a dress a size larger.  Ordered in white and it was a bit too transparent- if over a crinoline or slip you would be fine but that made it too fussy for me"
3.0,it was a Christmas gift
3.0,This top has an extra layer in the front but it is still very thin and a beige bra could be seen under it. It also did not lay flattering on me.
3.0,Looks pretty much like the picture. Slightly sheer just because it's chiffon. Only issue is that the legs are short but the torso is long. I'm 5'6 and ordered a 4/6 medium and it's weird fitting and too short.
3.0,"While I like the fabric and cut of these tops they run very short!  I am 5'7"" and ordered an XL.  They do not supply much coverage in the rear if you are doing yoga or working out at the gym."
3.0,Upsize the shirt for a better fit. It’s fun and well made but it runs small at the waist.
3.0,"While the design was very nice, it is too large to be worn as a necklace."
3.0,"Nice hoodie, but definitely buy a size up even if your looking for a tighter fit"
3.0,The only thing that really bothers me is the bail that hooks the pendant to the necklace is more of a gold color and the metal in the pendant is more copper colored. It doesn't match and makes it look cheap.
3.0,Doesn’t stay up at all
3.0,"I ordered an XXL because I’m large breasted and this material is stretchy. The tank fits ok, but the arm holes are too large and show my  bra under my arms. I plan to stitch the side seam a little more under the arm to make it work."
3.0,"I like this nightgown.<br />Overall, it washed well in the washing machine on the warm cycle. It looked like it dried as expected on the normal cycle.<br />However...<br />After machine washing once, the lace became too tight across my boobs. If you are a C cup or bigger, order a bigger size.<br />I rewashed/dried this nightgown and tried stretching the lace without much difference...still too tight for my preference. The section below the lace is fine.<br />I'll probably give this one away and order the slightly higher size.<br />It's a nightgown. I do not like to sleep in tight ""anything""."
3.0,These are comfortable but I wouldn't call them slippers. They are more like water shoes.
3.0,"They are cute and flexible but WAY TOO BIG. Order at least one size smaller. The branding is all in Chinese, so maybe confusion in size there."
3.0,"I'm unsure what Treezyn is considering a late season. Here in upstate NY 30 degrees or colder while hunting, these gloves and their hats do not cut it.  Make them thicker as well as your late season gator, it's too tight small and not warm at all."
3.0,"The top is beautiful but unless you have perfectly set boobs or no boobs at all you will spill out of it,especially out the sides. It looksdecent with a flowy cardigan over it, but a little uncomfortable."
3.0,I had to send the first one back because it was broken. Not the highest quality for even a cheap necklace
3.0,"5'5"" 220lbs and 40C.  I could not get past the look of this dress.  The ruffles on the sleeve look great on the model, but on a plus size person like me, it just looks weird and adds so much volume whiten I want to look slimmer.  The dress fit me ok, but this would definitely fit an hourglass figure better not an apple like myself.  The dark red color isn't bad though."
3.0,"I love how comfy it is. Honestly I could have gotten a half size smaller.<br /><br />I loved the idea of a silicone ring that looked more like my normal wedding set.  My one and only complaint is that the silver color is not all the way through the silicone. Within a week I had “scratches” where the gray shows.<br />I would buy again, but in a different color."
3.0,tight fit but i still like them
3.0,Right shoe stopped lighting up after a week
3.0,"I liked the socks, but the foot bed was too large for my size 7 feet.  The toe seam was not shaped, but stitched straight across (and unevenly at that) so it created a wad in my shoe."
3.0,Finish started coming off within a few months.
3.0,"The dress is nice, but the jacket deters from the outfit because of the low quality."
3.0,I got this for a business photo shoot. Jacket fit nice but pants too small.  Fortunately the jacket alone is worth it.
3.0,Cute but shorter than expected :/<br />Manage to make it work tho.
3.0,"I like the style - bought it off season so haven't worn it yet, but it runs very small -- as I believe other's have reviewed as well."
3.0,Just got this for Daugther for Christmas.  It came with a ribbon clip not a key chain.  The leg portion shows white stripes.. it appears they are missing the white stripes or they were sewn inside out.  Also green and red ribbon is mich lower quality than what was pictred.  Just tube with decals on it.  Picture shows tube filled in with raised wrap around rings on it. Will see how she likeps it as it took over a month to get.
3.0,"Nice earrings. Well made, just wish they were bigger<br />Love their proucts"
3.0,The shirt would have been perfect if it wasn't so long on me. Nice material and not too fitted.
3.0,it is a very pretty blouse but the size is too small
3.0,"I gave it a three star because the material is kind of thick and the shirt is just a tad too short. You can def run a true size unless you’re busty. It can also be a little snug around the arms as well. If you’re just trying to hide a belly this shirt is great, you just won’t be able to wear it with leggings because it’s not long enough to cover anything below your waistline other than the sides. Overall it’s a cute shirt. Just not quite the fit I expected."
3.0,The design washed off in one wash.
3.0,Too big (medium).  Donated it to Goodwill for someone else to love.  Nice color.
3.0,"This would be a kind of cute dress for trips to the grocery or shopping. I like the material which is soft. The bottom is rather painted on and I think would eventually peel with many washings. I would definitely wash by hand or on delicate. It a rather weird color grey, almost a greenish, grey color. The most bizarre thing was that it is made like a shirt: longer in front and back and shorter on both sides.  You can't see through it, so that's a plus. I cannot really say I would buy something like this again. The bottom is just weird."
3.0,Pretty many compliments
3.0,Cute but fragile for the price!
3.0,"runs small, so based on reviews I ordered an L (normally wear 4/6) and it fit well.  I picked the &#34;orange&#34; because I liked the top print but neither the top or bottom was orange and the top and bottom colors did not match.  It worked for me b/c the bottom matches another top I have but may not work for everyone."
3.0,I am a man with large hands and these are very tight and difficult to put on and take off. I wish they made a larger size.
3.0,I like the overall design however it did not fit an adult male.
3.0,"This golf club stand is attractive and was easy to assemble, but even though the screws provided are fully screwed in-securing the three parts, the stand is not stable - it wobbles a bit.  It still does the job of holding clubs in a neat manner but for the hefty price, i expected a little more quality."
3.0,I ordered a small as per my height 4.11” and it was long as expected. Although I got the legs hem the knees cuts were higher and the inseam was not straight.
3.0,Let you know after Christmas.
3.0,"It’s okay. I have broad shoulders and wanted to love it but the sleeves were just too much got my body type and made me look like a football player. I loved the style and fit of the skirt part. The fabric was just okay, not too see thru which was nice. Unfortunately had to return."
3.0,Feels and more like a bedroom slipper and does not where for outdoor work
3.0,Great bands just the wrong size for my watch. Just make sure of your band size.
3.0,"Nice gloves but a little big for me.  On the plus side, I like the fabric on top that allows some air in.  The rubber part is thick enough to work well with my roses. They come up over the wrist which is nice.  I will certainly use even if they are a little big."
3.0,Good looking watch but it is soooooo thick! needs to be thinner.
3.0,"The shirt is ""see through"" and larger than described. Ordered the small. (5ft) Over all is okay. Looks nice."
3.0,The cup size seemed a bit small.  I purchased a 42E and that couldn't possibly be the correct cup size.  It fit fine on my back.  It isn't that bad and i can make it work for now.  I recommend buying two cup sizes up for your normal size.
3.0,"The band is exactly what I was looking for, and the price point is awesome. However, the color on the buckle is starting to wear off only after two days. It’s not super noticeable, but still a downside."
3.0,"Cute, just ordered to big of size."
3.0,The dress was nice I just should’ve ordered a size smaller.
3.0,I really like the anti slip grips on the bottom of these. And they are a nice thickness. They would have been perfect for my one year old. Unfortunately they just didn’t hold up. I bought two packs and every pair got a hole in them within 1-2 wears.
3.0,"Pretty baggy and doesn’t have a cinched waist like in the picture, had to take it in a couple inches but it’s very soft and comfy"
3.0,Fits tight under the armpits per 5 year old daughter 46 pounds. Sizing varies per style so hard to size.
3.0,Daughter is 10 and true to size. We ordered a 12 since the review says these jackets run small. The jacket barely fits her. Order two sizes larger at least. We need to return it
3.0,"Works great but you need to keep the ""stickers"" to be able to wear them again"
3.0,"The dress was a size one size fits most, but it flared out too much for me on the bottom part.  The tube part fit great. The material was great, but I returned the dress.  It just flared out to much."
3.0,"I generally like purchasing short (mini) dresses because on me the hem will hit an inch or two above the knee and I won't have to take the time to adjust it.  What I did not take into consideration with this dress is just how low the neckline would be on my chest.  I am not opposed to wearing a low neck, but this was w-a-y lower than I'd ever be comfortable wearing.  As for the fabric, the manufacturer isn't kidding in the description -- the fabric is definitely lightweight.  I would go so far as to say...ahem...a little too lightweight.  The sunlight or florescent light back lighting the dress will definitely show off the shape of your legs.  If you are into that.  (No judgement).  Although the print is cute I did send the dress back because of the neckline on me."
3.0,I like this shirt I just wish the pocket was sewn folded on top of the pocket because it lays open other than that I like the shirt
3.0,Order a size up! Love the mesh black heart pattern. Super cute for the price for a date night or special occasion. Don’t get it snagged though!
3.0,"As soon as I took it out of the box and laced it up, a piece came off. Not happy."
3.0,The skirt is adorable and I loved it. So I was bummed that it just wasn't a good fit. It was tight in the hips a really big in the waist. Even if I had sized up it would have been way to big in the waist. I am 5'6 and 145 lbs. I wear a medium. This skirt is better suited for someone who is not curvy.
3.0,Tight across the chest
3.0,"Its a nice fabric stretchy ,the only thing is that the slit is in the middle not like in the picture that shows ot on the side ,and if you like modest slit this is not the one because theres no wayy you can modify it a little bit ,it nice tho and the price is perfect.."
3.0,Wife liked it .
3.0,"""STYLE - Reliable chino pant sits at natural waist with pull on elastic waistband, drawstring detail and four usable pockets on a straight leg body""<br />IN REALITY, THERE ARE ONLY 2 USABLE POCKETS AND THE DRAWSTRING IS NOT A FUNCTIONING DRAWSTRING, IT IS USELESS (I CUT IT OFF) PANTS STRETCH AND BECOME TOO LOOSE,  A FUNCTIONING DRAWSTRING WOULD HAVE MADE THEM A PERFECT PANT."
3.0,"Just received them and haven't worn them yet, so I can't speak to how they hold up, but a helpful hint for tall ladies - these come up about 2 inches above my knee caps.  Frankly, I'm OK with that because any further and the tighter top band would probably cut into my leg and be unflattering."
3.0,Very thin and sheer but cute for around the house
3.0,It’s pretty cute but I ordered an xl to be safe I usually wear a large and it was still way too small. It’s also a little thin so you can see through it.
3.0,too cute - loved them - ordered same size as other summer pjs ordered around the same time but these were too small :(
3.0,I need help. They are stuck and I’ve been trying to take them out for quite a while. I accidentally put them on opposite place. Instead of how it originally was. But other than that they are good
3.0,Its super cute. But I didn't receive the headband
3.0,"The shipping was very fast and it looks better than it does it the pictures. However, it is not Sterling Silver and the item description is misleading. So if that does not bother you, then I would go ahead and buy it"
3.0,It's a ok watch I bought it to wear to work.  It a nice looking wateh.  Just made a little cheap.
3.0,I love it but my hair is too long and thick for it. It’s ok but I’ll try to make it work
3.0,This choker is very pretty but it is indeed cheap.
3.0,This pair of earrings are pretty but surprisingly larger in size than pictured. If you like large earrings these would be great. The lower bead is almost 3/4 inch in diameter.
3.0,item is as expected.
3.0,I would have liked it better if the pocket for the phone was on the outside instead of having to open the entire purse to access the phone. The window doesn't give you access to the volume or power buttons
3.0,"The other reviewers weren't kidding about them running small. Over a size smaller than listed. Snaps are cheap and hard to close since they're on backwards in my opinion. Serviceable I suppose, but too expensive for the quality."
3.0,These are very high. They have alot of cushion at the heel which is nice but they felt so unnatural in the shoes.
3.0,It's a little tight around the arms (and I am a tiny human) and the tassels honestly kind of ruin it. They just hang/look weird unfortunately. Nice material though.
3.0,"It's not a bad hat. Comfortable and the side visors are handy. But the fabric dye runs when you sweat. My hat is now a weird grey, blue and beige combo."
3.0,"I loved it until the top's material came undone along the seam. Otherwise great true to size fit. If they only improved the quality of sewing and remove/replace those awful wires, it could have been a great bikini. What a shame!"
3.0,"Not a good quality, an extra element that makes it heavy,"
3.0,"These are comfortable, stretchy fabric. Regular fit. I haven't noticed any see-through issues, even with the gray color. The pockets are deep.<br /><br />Quality is just OK. Various seams started fraying after a couple washes: so far only on the inside, and nothing has come seriously undone. I do not anticipate they will last in good condition for more than a year, so I would not buy again."
3.0,"My wife liked this bra.  She was very happy with the feel and fit.<br /><br />But this bra is a bit expensive.  At around the same price, you can already get a nice bra at Victoria Secret."
3.0,These are sweatpants with very nice fleece inside until you feel the underside of the kitten patch.
3.0,"Got this for my husband for Christmas, as just an around-the-house robe. It's fairly thin, but is in towel-material like I wanted. I'd give a longer review, but he's yet to actually wear it. I'd say it's okay for a cheap robe, but it's definitely not plush or high quality."
3.0,"Bought this coat because it said the pockets were DEEP.  They are not.  They do not comfortably fit a cell phone, let alone anything else.  Overall, the coat is warm but not weatherproof."
3.0,"They're smaller than expected. I'm a C cup and these feel kinda small, like they belong in a training bra."
3.0,Love the color but having trouble shaping it so it looks like picture.
3.0,Fit was a little small and the front sides were digging into my toes. I returned these
3.0,"The cut is perfect, the waist line needs a firm band, it is so flimsy that I frequently have to pull it up."
3.0,Super tiny!
3.0,"The harness seems to be constructed well. The elastic loops that hold the cameras on the harness aren't exactly the greatest though. Some instructions would be nice for the set up of this. All I got was a card with a website on it for ""service."" Deleting the extra on the web address brought me to their product website which has no mention of any of these products. It would be nice that my first multiple camera harness came with a bit of basic instructions about the use of the product.<br /><br />There is no quick release allowing you to put it on. You have to put it on like a T-shirt over your head. There are two small clips that can be opened but then it's a two person job finding them to put back in place. If there were a quick release for what fits around you, then the product would be better and more functional. As it goes now, I'm not a fan of this harness at all. Once you have it on, it requires adjustments so since you can't just slip it on and clip it in place, it gets to be tedious trying to locate the unhooked strap to reconnect it in it's extremely tiny connection as shown in first picture. Not the best design unless you're super skinny. Not a fan of having do dive into it and spread my arms as if swimming to let it fall into place and then battle with the adjustment of the harness to fit your body.<br /><br />There is no quick way of installing the harness. Sorry but to buy a product and guess if you are using the assorted clips and straps correctly shouldn't be a puzzle. No support in the package other than a card that takes you to a service repair page. Their main website only shows brackets, camera mounts, handles and supports. There are no products shown of harnesses whatsoever on their site. A bit disappointing for product support.<br /><br />I would rate this product higher if it came with a basic set of instructions. I'm decent at puzzles but I shouldn't have to guess if the use of the attachments or extras are correct especially when my gear is as expensive as it is. I don't need to drop any of my gear due to improper mounting either from guess work. I may not be a genius, but I'm not a dummy either."
3.0,Good every day dress. Nice. Smallish. It's okay.
3.0,I got a XXL. I'm 5'0&#34; and 170lbs. When I tried it on it was short in the torso even for me. I barely had enough ribbon to tie the halter part. I wish it was just a little longer in the torso. Other than that it's cute.
3.0,"One strand didnt work at all. The other 2 together were ok. In other words, &#34;as expected&#34; considering the price"
3.0,"The dress was nice, however a bit longer than I wanted so I returned it."
3.0,"I am using these bags for masks.  5 bags were good, 4 not so good but we're still usable and one I tossed."
3.0,"I bought the navy blue/white shirt (shown as the icon) and it's very see-through material. Beautiful shirt, but I can even see my bra through it."
3.0,"Like someone stated before you can only wear this down towards the ear lobe and after about 30 minutes to an hour it's very uncomfortable, hurts like heck but it's cute.  If I had to do over, would I purchase....no"
3.0,I love the dress but the bust is too small. I'll have to return it.
3.0,"Awkward to put on, doesn't fit comfortably."
3.0,"I bought this romper for a Halloween costume and the material is so thin. It also gets loose throughout the day. In the first day of wear, it got a slight hole in the front by the pockets and I have no idea how that even happened. It literally looked like it scratched it with my nail getting my phone out and it ripped. I don’t think I would recommend."
3.0,I like the sleek look. Not bulky like traditional Denali. But it's not as warm either. It would be warmer and better if it was windproof.
3.0,Works great but scratches very easily
3.0,"I was worried about sizing based on other comments, but I'm usually either a small or medium, and I ordered medium, and really, it was only a bit short in the torso, so I think the sizing isn't a major issue. The pattern, with it's triangle pointing up on the bottom section, emphasizes the hips A LOT. I will be returning it because I don't like the way it looks. Also, there are large cup inserts for a medium sized suit, and the cups sit very low. They are easily removed, but just know that they drag down rather than emphasize the breasts. Other issue I think needs to be mentioned, though it doesn't have to do with the suit itself, is the shipping. I've had products come from overseas, even China, before, but never did it take this long. If you want this suit for the summer season, order it NOW, because it was delayed once, and altogether took 7 weeks to arrive. And now I'm sending it back."
3.0,"The print is adorable. However the bodice/ top panel pictured is all there is of the top, more like an apron top. It wasn't a good fit for my daughter, so sadly it was unwearable."
3.0,"This product is beautiful and is easy to add to your bra. If you are top heavy or over 38 D boobs, this product isn't for you. My straps lasted less than an hour before they broke. I was very disappointed because I was at an event when it happened."
3.0,"This looked like a return. Maybe that's why the price was so very reasonable? The removable Miracle Suit tag that is supposed to hang on the outside of the bathing suit was taped on. And the plastic liner in the crotch looked creased as if it had been removed and re-applied. Yuk. The suit itself looked new and did not seem to have any issues, however, so I tried it on with a pair of panties. It fit, and I desperately needed a new suit, so into the washer it went. The cups are a little on the large size, but because of the the way they are made in the suit, it looks as if that's all me. Ha. Miracle Suits are indeed flattering.  I am a US 14-16."
3.0,Runs a bit large and fits kinda awkwardly. I am happier with my cheaper Hanes sweaters
3.0,"I liked everything about them, from the style to the fabric but the fit was too small"
3.0,The chain broke literally the first time my daughter wore it... so not great quality there.  But the pendant is perfect!
3.0,Normally a L and it fit like a small to medium. I wouldn’t mind the thin cheap material if it fit according to size. If you’re a small normally and want a slightly loose fit order a medium or large
3.0,"Cute skirt, fits as expected but the zipper gets stuck often."
3.0,Very much larger than expected. Seems cheaply made did not wash well
3.0,"Purchased these glasses to use when I am using my computer.  They are tight through the temple.  Also, the nose piece on one pair and a very rough edge which made them uncomfortable to wear.  These problems are small but annoying and I am not sure I would reorder them."
3.0,My baby has worn this necklace for about a week now. I can't say that I have noticed a difference in his teething symptoms at all but it's super cute on the little guy.
3.0,The zipper on the right boot bends into my ankle. Today I am wearing them for the first time. So far other than zipper digging into my ankle pretty comfortable. I'm getting many compliments. I will work on the zipper trying to bend it out away from my ankle.
3.0,"Bright color, nice material but it is WAY to big. I have to wrap way over the ribbon area on the waist that you’re supposed to wrap."
3.0,I thought she would like it.
3.0,Soft but tight Spandexy feel
3.0,"It is cool looking, I wish the seller would have mentioned it ran short, so I have to be carefull on the kind of pants I wear with it, otherwise I like it."
3.0,"fits alright, not the best material but oh well."
3.0,These were like clown shoes on my daughter. She has wide feet and a high arch but came no where near filling out these shoes.  Too bad tho because they were well made and very comfy looking.
3.0,"Acrylic, doesn’t feel soft to the touch and ran small.  If I had seen it first, I wouldn’t have purchased it"
3.0,"I loved this outfit online but when I tried it on, the size was not to fit. The pants portion was too long in length. The outfit's material was very thin. Love the look, but the fit and make are not of quality."
3.0,"Quality looks cheap but, I haven't worn it yet.  I like it."
3.0,"These are NOT bioplast, Bioplast means flexible and they are a bit safer than just acrylic. the package also was not sealed and it looks like somebody just put a bunch of used rings on it to sell. not very professional or safe feeling i am upset about this. they are cute and they got here a day sooner than stated."
3.0,Them arrived very nice and pretty but I guess my ears or fat or something because I can not get them to close. Very disappointed because I love the style.
3.0,"The Chevy S-10 Tear Drop Metal Key Ring was a little disappointing. It is significantly smaller and lighter in weight and mass than what I was expecting. However, it was priced accordingly."
3.0,I like how the jacket looks on. It fits well.<br />This is not a jacket for warmth only fashion.<br />Also it has a strong plastic smell that I hope goes away.  But for a quick look not bad for the money. If you expect high quality this is not for you. If you are looking for a cute cheap leather looking jacket then this one may fit the bill.
3.0,"These leggings are not a good fit, even though I ordered my normal size. They seem to run big.  For one thing, there's too much extra material on the legs, they're actually loose, they don't cling to my legs like leggings should and you can even see creases. The waist is high and it feels a little tight. Also I don't like how the pockets on each side stick out, although they do come in handy. As far as their quality, the material feels smooth, it stretches well and I would say, it's a little thick. They held up well in my washer (cold water, delicate cycle) and dryer."
3.0,Cheap material. Cute style but very cheaply made.
3.0,"Cute shirt, but I bought it because it is polyester and I wouldn't need to iron it.  Sadly I must iron it.  So much for easy care!"
3.0,"This is loose fitting for the top but super snug in the hips. Love that it's long but the sleeves are short. It came super wrinkled. It is warm, the color is pretty, and the length is nice. Not sure if sizing up would work because the top half is big and it might make you look heavy and boxy."
3.0,"This ran extremely small. I ordered a small, but it is too small across the shoulders. It causes the chest area to roll up creating an unsightly bulge across my collar bone area just below the turtle neck. I should gave sized up to a medium, but i wanted something form fitting to go under other layers. Note ti buyer... go up a size. The shirt is extremely thin and transparent. I have to wear the white shirt with a nude bra or bodysuit underneath. Even then, the undergarments are visible through the shirt. This is a good layering piece."
3.0,"It's really pretty, but the first time trying it on one of the jewels came out. Not noticeable when wearing, but still a little disappointing."
3.0,I now wear only the basic loop of these earrings because 1 by 1 the bottom loops fell off.
3.0,The fit is great and and it definitely looks good. The only flip side was the material which was scratchy and rough. I would have to wear this with a full sleeves all the time.
3.0,This top is very tight in the chest and it has slits on the sleeves. It looks tacky instead of classy I am not happy with this purchase.
3.0,The sleeves are not cut right and don’t align properly. Looks ok
3.0,"This is a very thick puffer jacket that seems made for freezing temperatures. It is heavy and the hood covers your head very well, so if I were braving a blizzard I would choose this coat above the others I currently have in my closet. I would give it five stars if it were it being aimed at women. The Medium size will NOT fit most guys, in my opinion - it's way too tight in the chest and waist, and unless you're particularly scrawny or small of frame, you will need to size up. If you're a woman and usually wear a Medium, it should fit you just fine."
3.0,The lace up part of the boot bend to easy
3.0,"This skirt was super cute but so tiny! I bought it for a costume party and sadly, I couldn't pull it over my hips. The waistband is a very tight elastic, and the feathers and skirt piece are actually good coverage. In other words, you wouldn't really need shorts underneath like I had thought...<br />Sadly I had to return because it didn't fit."
3.0,Disproportionately combined items. Sizes are all over the place. Size you order corresponds with the robe.
3.0,Nice but was smaller than thought
3.0,Love the dress but I received a medium and ordered a small. I am keeping it but it is too big. I ordered the small because it seems to run large from other reviews and it definitely does.
3.0,Do not expect more than 10-12 wears of these sneakers. They are more for novelty use than actual wear. My son wore them to an all white glow party and he looked great. He said they are very comfortable. They charged nicely at first but after the 6th time wearing them they started to glitch. They also lost their shape quickly and was a bigger dirt magnet than the average white shoes. I have since thrown them away.
3.0,"Although this pajama dress is very cute I was disappointed by the poor construction. Specifically the button holes were poorly done. One was sewn completely shut while the others had openings too small for the buttons. The fabric itself is nice like a lightweight tee shirt. There are lace embellishment s at the hem, wrists and pocket. But the button placket needs alteration before this garment is useable."
3.0,No choice in bottom size.
3.0,Cheaply made and broke SO easy (unfolding them)
3.0,Brought these for my 13 year old daughter as a stocking stuffer. She even gave me one and the work like a regular belt without the buckle digging in your stomach. She was giving me another one but I noticed on off the fasteners would not fasten on one side. To late to return so I'll stick it up.
3.0,"pretty cheaply made, looks ok but spend a bit more on something better"
3.0,"I ordered the orange design, and after receiving it, it is definitely not orange. The band is more of a creamy white/yellow. The dial has really faint orange, almost yellow markings. I bought this to match a specific suit, but it’s not going to work for my needs. All in all, it is still a decent looking watch, but not the color shown in the picture."
3.0,Not flattering on me. I sent it back.
3.0,It's great but my coworkers will think I'm crazy with a Santa sticker on the front of it???<br /><br />Please send me one without a sticker!
3.0,"Another review from the lady of the house:<br /><br />I got this tank top to have something comfy to sleep in and wear around the house during the hot summers. I wanted something mostly cotton and loose-fitting, but I had no idea how large this would run.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that this navy shirt is a lot darker than what was shown on the product page. That’s actually okay, since the shorts I am matching are darker, too.<br /><br />The fabric is lightweight and stretchy, due to the 95% cotton and 5% Spandex fabric content. I got a large, thinking it would shrink some, but it did not shrink at all. In fact, when I laundered it in cold water and tumble dried it on low as instructed, it wrinkled some, but didn’t change in size or shape. I probably would have been happier with a medium or possibly even a small (normal size range is usually M-L).<br /><br />The arm and neck openings are really big, reminding me of the “muscle shirts” I’ve seen some guys wear. There’s no way I would wear this in public, since it shows too much to be modest. I wouldn’t call it “dressy” by any stretch of the imagination, either. With the pocket on the front, it’s got more of a sporty, casual look. It’s also boxier than I expected—again, almost like it was made for a guy more than a gal. Fortunately, I have wide shoulders, so that’s not a problem.<br /><br />The fabric is slightly slick feeling—most likely due to the Spandex. However, it’s not plastic or creepy feeling. It felt lightweight and cool on my skin, which is exactly what I need to deal with the summer heat. It was not as soft as a regular T-shirt, but it didn’t feel bad.<br /><br />I would not pay anything near the almost $21 the seller was asking at the time of this review! If it was a Tommy Hilfiger shirt with obvious branding, some status-conscious teen might go for that, but not a fiscally responsible adult. Something around $10-15 is more appropriate. If you do buy it, purchase the smaller of your size range, and don’t expect the exact color pictured."
3.0,"Just not flattering on me. Makes me hips and thighs appear even larger than they are, and they aren’t small :) The pattern is cute and the quality is okay, fabric is sort of rough. I had hoped it would be like the Emerson Fry caftan it’s copies after but the proportions are off."
3.0,"I had been looking for some cute and affordable resin rings for quite some time and was super excited to get my hands on these but am sad to say that I ended up returning them due to its limited variety in size/adjustability. The size of my hands/fingers fall under the category of a more small/petite fit. The largest size I wear is a 6, but these were unfortunately too large for my fingers and couldn’t even fit my thumbs. It’s also not as adjustable as the description had stated which is understandable in terms of the material it’s made of — (and the fact that it’s a little bulky (because it’s resin)) but it was quite unfortunate especially because I was excited about them :( they’re super cute though! Statement piece with a dash of minimalism :) is a great statement ring but wouldn’t recommend to those who have small fingers like myself >.&lt;"
3.0,"I ordered two different prints. The black run smaller for some reason. Other than that, I love the style and fabric. Thank you!"
3.0,I ordered a large. Fit like a slim medium. I returned the same day I got it.
3.0,It was super cute but the flowers started to fall off the very first time we used it.
3.0,"It looks great on the inter-net.  It has a major flaw,which the beautiful flowers that you on top of the watch fall off.  What the company has done is placed a round piece of plastic on a flat surface and stick a little glue on it.  Then in just the rigth moment the little plastic top tops off, leaving a shining surface.  I was lucky that I was in the house and recover the top and reglued.  Lools good but be careful in what you buy."
3.0,I'm 5'8 and they were bunching around my knees. The large fit wise otherwise seems to be designed for a size 14 or smaller. I'm a size 16 and they were snug but not uncomfortable except for the material gathering around the knees.<br /><br />Love the material.
3.0,"It looked better on the Amazon, very cheap looking in person."
3.0,Pretty as fits nicely but doesn’t last. It’s been a week and the crystals are already falling out.
3.0,"These were pruchased by my father as a gift to me. I live in Minnesota, we haven't even experienced the coldest days of winter and yet when I wear these for a long period of time my toes freeze! I used them while up on our roof to clear some snow off, it was about a foot deep, feet stayed dry but my toes were frozen almost. Went ice fishing in 34° weather, was out there for about 2 hours and again my toes were frozen! Today, went to check out some local ice castles.....toes got extremely cold! So they might look great and feel pretty comfy, if you plan on being outside for anything over an hour..... I'd look for maybe a different boot.<br /><br />And yes, I wear thick winter socks with these and fully lace them up!!!"
3.0,"the shorts are nice, but the elastic waist is messed up and bunches up and does not fit like it should."
3.0,"Unfortunately, my townhome office returned this before I could pick it up! After only one day of it being in the mailroom. Oh well, I will order again and send it to my job. Can't wait to receive and try it out."
3.0,"It's nice looking but too big for me, so I decided to return it."
3.0,"I ordered these leggings in Sky Blue....the color is beautiful and completely on trend right now.  They’re quite soft, fit well, and are squat proof.  Unfortunately, every drop of sweat shows through....EVERY SINGLE DROP!  I wore these for a moderate intensity class that isn’t a high sweat work out for me.  Before the warm-up was over the front of my pubic bone was getting visibly darker in the studio mirror.  20 minutes in, there was moisture showing through on the tops of my knees and behind my calves...do knees sweat?!  By the end of my 45 minute class I was horrified to see these leggings looked like tie dye...not attractive.  I didn’t even notice my butt until I got home 15 minutes later...it was drenched AND the minimal amount of cellulite I have was visible through the fabric...yikes!!  No idea what happened because I simply didn’t sweat this much.  Regardless, there’s no way I’ll ever wear these to the gym again, not even for yoga!"
3.0,"They do not hold up well in the wash. Perhaps if you wash them by hand? After one cycle in a new washing machine, they were riddled with holes."
3.0,Love this design but it ran even smaller than I expected.
3.0,"For the price, I recommend this shirt. However, be aware that it will feel a little boxy in the shoulders due to the ruffling (which originally appealed to me in the pictures). As attested to by others, the buttons are a bit flimsily attached;  but only having worn it twice, they are still attached. I am typically a 34B/C and 6-8 in most items but ordered the XL based on recommendations. I could have gotten by with the L but the XL isn't far off."
3.0,"While attractive, the watch is huge, and is sized more like those &#34;urban&#34; watches. I am nearly 200 pounds and 6'3&#34;."
3.0,It was a cute style but didn’t try it on so I can’t say anything about the fit but I didn’t like the fabric at all. It was more like a silky polyester feel which wasn’t what I wanted so returned it.
3.0,These are really really cute but I wear a 10 and the 10 in these is tight. I've always worn a 10 in Sketchers. This one pushes my toes so much that I get a terrible cramp in the top of my foot after wearing them too long. They also rub my small toe raw. Guess I should have sent them back but I was hoping they'd break in.  They haven't.
3.0,This shirt is wider then it is long. Pitcure is faded<br />Cheap quality and print.
3.0,"There's a small pleat in the front that's a little off. Other than that it's okay. I bought it to wear under a cardigan, but wouldn't wear it on its own because it looks a little cheap. I usually wear size 8 and bought an XL, which fit well."
3.0,I really loved this belly jewelry and was very disappointed when all of the silver basically rubbed off to reveal a lower quality metal with a different color.  Only the bar is surgical steel.  Not worth the price but great design.  Very disappointed and won’t be purchasing again.
3.0,Cute design.. but they are too small
3.0,Too NEON for my comfort. but very pretty ( SHOWS OFF THE CURVER ;)
3.0,You can see right through the white material to the shorts and I wouldn’t wear dark underwear even under two layers of fabric.
3.0,"Will serve the purpose but assortment not very.  5 black, NO blue, 2 grey, 1 red, 1 white, 2 bright pink, 1 pale pink (not even pictured)"
3.0,Love the dress but the flowers looks like they are glue to the dress
3.0,"El material no es muy bueno , pero están lindas y cómodas ."
3.0,"The bag is nice but the ad is misleading.  It says genuine lambskin leather large purse but it is not ALL leather.  The body is leather but the handles, trim, bottom and flap are all NOT leather.  I understand it was very inexpensive and that should have been the giveaway.  For the money it is ok."
3.0,Just felt baggy.
3.0,It's not so easy to take out once in the lock
3.0,These were not 35&#34; inseam. They are shorter then 35&#34;.
3.0,"I purchased this dress in hopes to wear it to a wedding. Although the delivery was fast and the dress was beautiful in person, it was way too short for me. I gave this dress 3 stars based on the quality and how quickly i received it. I would recommend it to others, but strongly suggest you know your measurements and follow the size chart."
3.0,This ring is very nice looking and the quality is better than I expected for the price. I wear a nine but the ring they sent me is a about a half size too large. I ordered a ring adjuster from another company to compensate because the ring did not come with a return slip. I am not sure if the order was picked wrong or if this ring simply runs large so you may want to order a half size smaller than you normally wear.<br /><br />Overall ring quality 5 stars<br /><br />ring price 5 stars<br /><br />ring fit two stars<br /><br />return policy 1/2 star
3.0,Sizes run small. I loved the pattern on them and that they had pockets. But they were too tight. I buy a large in every other pair of leggings I’ve bought. But these were too tight.
3.0,Does not fit well in the shoulders.<br />Like the shirt...gave it to my mom!
3.0,"Material seams very cheap.  Looks like pajamas,  not a dress"
3.0,"While the pants definitely looked like faux leather, they were so loud when I walked and bunched at the knees and ankles."
3.0,Not sure if I needed to get a bigger size but where my arm pit is  - feels tight and slightly uncomfortable but the sleeves are big.  I am going to try and work with it and not send it back or I might have to cut it some how so that it doesnt bother me.
3.0,"Stitching at the shoulder area is a little off, so it puckers up a little."
3.0,Good quality items but not the material I wanted. Can't breathe in these. I thought they were the sponge type so my bad.
3.0,"These earrings were just what I was looking for... but they're heavy on my earlobes.  The write-up stated light weight but not so.  I'll be able to wear for short periods of time, but not as much as I'd like."
3.0,I got this for my grand daughter.  It's perfect for a child.
3.0,"I think they'd be great but after trying to break them in for a day, left foot went number, too small, order half size larger."
3.0,"The scarf does not match the image which is draped on the model. The size and shape are rather different. It is a gauze like material.<br />Quite thin. The design of the material is not as distinctive, but rather faded and dreary. Too bad!"
3.0,Stays the same colors
3.0,Really don’t like anything about these would return but threw the package away. They run small and don’t look like the picture. Thought the legs were straighter than what they really are and they are very small in the hips.
3.0,"the frame of my glasses hits the lens of this goggle, not acceptable, returned for refund"
3.0,"to small didn't fit always around and I have a  normal size neck , but it was very cute item , but cant use it I have to give it as a gift for a child"
3.0,"5’4”, 120 pounds, ordered size small skirt. This skirt fits perfectly, is comfortable, and is definitely flattering. I do have a few one issue with it though. The fabric is very thin so so you can see through it. I bought the white skirt so any underwear or tucked in shirt is very visible. The other downfall with the thin fabric is that you can see seams. Both my underwear and shirt lines were visible through the skirt. I think if this skirt just had an extra layer of white fabric underneath, these problems would be solved. Personally, I think I will be looking for a skirt made of a thicker material so that I don’t have to worry. I also feel that a thicker material looks more professional."
3.0,I person didn't like the fit. Just didn't feel right.
3.0,Lightweight<br />Good product for the price
3.0,It' nice but a little too small
3.0,A little small but i still like the style.
3.0,"Nice, but not excellent leather, very good stitching.  I have normal hands, and average finger length, the gloves M, fit the palm and back of hand great, but the fingers, of the glove, are too long.  I often have this problem with gloves, so it's not a hit against Fratelli.  I paid around $28 free shipping, probably fair price, it's not a bargain, and it's not &#34;junk.&#34;  Just a nice pair of gloves, that seem to be well made."
3.0,"I like the design, but the thumbs are not warm enough . When it is ten degrees Fahrenheit it will get very cold inside the mittens."
3.0,Lasted 3 months before falling apart.
3.0,Doesn’t fit loose like picture but colors are very nice.
3.0,"Good color, nice size 7.5&#34;. Beads fit perfectly. I recommend these to friends and family members. Try it you'll like it"
3.0,"Most if the assembly was rather easy. However, when stacking the two pieces together in the middle, the bottom edges did not fit in with the surface of the base. In fact, we ended up having to break the edge in order for it to do its job."
3.0,"I just got this today and I'm sending it back tomorrow. It could have been a bit longer, it didn't cover all of my post baby chub. I do have a slightly long torso so maybe it would be okay for someone else. Also, I had it almost to the tightest adjustment and I didn't feel like it was tight enough. The Velcro felt strong but it was hard to get that much Velcro to lay flat while trying to keep it in place and tight at the same time. Perhaps if there were three sperate pieces of Velcro it would be easier. I ended up liking a three piece set much better."
3.0,Very good shirt. Material is a little rough and scratchy around the collar but if you wear a balaclava or something you should be fine. Sleeves were also disappointingly short even for an XL but not such a big deal especially if you wear gloves or have a watch on.
3.0,Nothing showed gold for the zippers. And a stone is missing. Not even going to bother trying these on.  I don't like the gold.  The picture  showed Silver zippers and Silver wings.  Also the zipper in general on these pants is extremely cheap. Washing instructions are odd. Cool gentle cycle.... but then at the end it says to Dry Clean. Well which is it???
3.0,Material was not the best for the price. The lace part breaks very easily and you can’t really fix that. But it does it’s job for the one time party use or wedding use. Might purchase again for other colors and different occasions.
3.0,Not very warm and run a bit small.
3.0,I am a puzzler and loved the picture on the front and it broke my heart to send it back but it was too small.<br />I ordered an XL but it was about a M in US sizing.  Too bad it was so small because I loved the design.<br />North Carolina
3.0,Horma muy pequeño y la calidad muy sencillo
3.0,"I’ve ordered this brand before and found the dresses to run a little large. Not so with this long hoodie dress. It’s slightly smaller than the size listed. Love the pockets, love the hood. The fabric is winter thick, very warm and soft inside, but no stretch AT ALL, which makes it awkward to remove. Also has started pilling under the arms after wearing it twice. It looks stylish and keeps me warm though."
3.0,Super cute but defective stitching. Bummer.
3.0,The seam immediately ripped. Not high quality craftmaship. Thin material. Good for spring. But not so good when you have to resew it. But it is a good indoor office cover.
3.0,The sizing is definitely funky. Ordered a medium which is apparently a Chinese XL. I'd consider it more of a &#34;large&#34;.
3.0,"Cute bra and feels like nice material, but wasn't a good fit. I'm a sm/med usually and the medium was too small around the rib cage for me."
3.0,"Is okay for the prize, but wish the picture on the locket was much more clear. Picture is foggy and not clear."
3.0,"The top is pretty cute but unfortunately the bottoms are a material that I don’t like and they’re a little too tight. I was hoping for the bottoms to be more like a soft cotton but instead they feel cheaply made and they don’t give enough stretch. I washed them to see if the stiffness would go away but it remained, if you don’t mind the material and you like a baggy look then order a size up. I got a medium and I’m about a size 7 in pants, the top might fit a little baggy as it kinda already is in a size medium."
3.0,"It is too big, too polyester, too easily snagged, hot, not great in any way.  Not a flattering cut or style either. Having had to wash it before trying it on due to the heavy chemical and static cling nature of the fabric it is in no return territory so alas for me but whoa to you unsuspecting folk contemplating this buy, don't bother."
3.0,Had to repair it several times and after just one wearing.
3.0,"size designation is smaller than expected, had to send them back and buy one size larger"
3.0,or if you the money already I haven't went yet but by the looks of it it looks like a beautiful Item I do like it so I can't complain
3.0,"Comfy waist, only complaint is the pocket is useless as it was sewed on upside down somehow."
3.0,It is okay. I definitely recommend washing this with fabric softener to give it a softer feel. It isn't bad by any means however. I enjoy using it.
3.0,"Its ok, Thought it was going to be a little tighter."
3.0,"Way smaller than what we thought, long chain, goes down to my daughter knees when shes wearing it. Pretty little purse, but it is actually the size of a change purse."
3.0,"Sad ran to small, however a nice coat!"
3.0,comfortable but lose their shape within 2hrs of wearing and sag in the rear and hips; but didn't expect much for such an inexpensive pair of jeans.
3.0,Dles not mold to wrist  It is still very stiff and buckle catches on clothes.
3.0,These left a red mark on my nose after a couple hours.
3.0,"We thought the claws came off, but they don't."
3.0,The stones are ok . The necklaces are adjustable but the length is more for a tall person imo bc it goes to my stomach . The bottom where the stone goes is very small but looks cool if you find the right piece .
3.0,The waistband doesn't feel great. It tends to loosen up as you're wearing it and you find yourself constantly pulling them up. Overall good quality in material
3.0,"The body length hit me in all the right places, but the sleeves were too short. My body type does not ever make me need long sleeves or a longer torso, this sweater just wasn't sized correctly, in my opinion. It is very cute and stylish so I am still wearing it I just need to push the sleeves up a tiny bit once my coat is off so no one sees that they are a few inches from actually reaching my wrist. I am going to try and stretch the sleeves out so it will be perfect, but keep this in mind when ordering."
3.0,"Looked like a cute gift and the price was great, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"This is a gift for my cousin. Although she likes most shades of blue, this may not be one of them. What I got is not the same color as pictured. The picture has what looks to be cerulean blue but what I got is closer to periwinkle. Hopefully she likes it."
3.0,Not nearly as bright as the picture would lead you to believe.
3.0,Runs small<br />Order up<br />Color true to pic<br />Decent fabric
3.0,The fit and color and fabric were great! Unfortunately the small pleats on the front were very awkward and drew attention to my bust in a weird way.
3.0,It fits well but with a lighter color it's getting dirty easily. I will have to see if it can be cleaned.
3.0,"I bought the biggest size knowing internet sizing is a whole different game and it fits, but not like the picture.  Very little fabric below the waist, but it is light which is great for summer."
3.0,Sizing runs a little small. Otherwise nice hoodie
3.0,"Size is about right - I'm a size 6 and got a small. I returned it though because the lace skirt just looks...papery? Like a paper tablecloth around your legs I guess. Just not for me, but it seems well made and the panty definitely covers everything."
3.0,Love this piece but gets tangeled very easily.
3.0,Very cheap and I would never trust them while on my motorcycle.  Great for my daughter cosplaying some steampunk.
3.0,"It looks visibly darker the color is way off, more like a reddish color, basically a tie dye. It is flimsy but I’m okay with it because it’s cotton. I’m still going to use it but it’s not really what i expected."
3.0,"The fabric is not the greatest....it's on the heavy side, but it washed well.  The decorations don't look like they were applied well."
3.0,"It fades in a couple of days, It fit my fingers perfectly..cause I have small skinny ones, but overall I like it!"
3.0,"Maybe at this size, one's expectations can't be too great. These were purchased intentionally small for a friend who has secondary piercings above her primary ones on her ears. They are advertised as having a better clarity and color rating than anything in their price class, which, IMO, is all the money in the world.<br /><br />I wanted a shallow mounting because I thought they would look better closer to the ear. But that may have minimized the sparkle factor since very little light can get behind them to reflect.<br /><br />They were delivered with a serviceable gift box, but no card or tag indicating the quality and carat. When I contacted the seller about including some information to indicate these superior qualities, I got a pretty terse response. My concern was that a giftee should know that despite the diminutive size, these were better in quality than most.  A ""certification"" wasn't included, they said, because that would have cost extra. And they preferred putting that extra value into the item. And, furthermore, they stood behind their product. The tone was not at all what I would expect from a seller eager to keep a customer happy and satisfied. Basically, I could trust their integrity or return them.<br /><br />With a birthday deadline, I kept them. I'm not an expert, but these don't offer much bling per dollar. The giftee is a close friend and we worked together many years. She sees a lot of people every day in a busy office and has not worn an additional earring/stud in the past. Not one person in the last month has commented on them. I guess that says it all."
3.0,"Cute dress, but waay to small. I couldn't even button it. Disappointed. Order up a size or 2."
3.0,"The back has frayed and my son recently blew out the toe. For the price I wasn't expecting too much, but was hoping they would at least last the summer."
3.0,Fits well but unimpressed with the fabric. It’s a bit see through and shiny and not in a good way
3.0,"this is definitely a juniors top, although it is very cute if you are a grown woman i would not recommend this top for you. i fit in it ok, but it  is clearly a bit snug and short for me... It is a good top , but yeah definitely for teens."
3.0,Already broken...Somewhat dissatisfied.  Additionally it is no longer available!
3.0,"The material was a little thick so the jacket just hung down straight and looked like a box on me. The inside is white-ish which I didn't think would bother me, but it did after getting it on. It was like wearing an old fashioned straight cardigan which was not flattering for my shape."
3.0,"Great value but it is Asian sizing, so be aware.  It is pretty but requires a bra extender because of the sizing."
3.0,Love the shirt design but runs really small so haven't worn it.
3.0,The material is scratchy.
3.0,I was really disappointed that these earrings were the same shape/curvature. One crawls up my ear while the other looks like a frown!
3.0,Shoes look beautiful.  Hurt my daughter's feet though.  She still loves them.  Some rhinestones fell off the first time she wore them.
3.0,Blouse looks nice with the pants that I bought it to pair with. However the material is not what I thought it would be. It’s more of a hospital scrub like material and that’s not my favorite material I actually thought it would be a softer more flowy type material but I’m gonna keep it because I’ve been looking for a shirt to wear with these pants for sometime so it’ll do.
3.0,Great looking but slips easy.
3.0,Love the style but these were waaaaay too small and I did size up based on other reviews. It’s too bad because they are adorable and the material was good quality.
3.0,They're beautiful but slide right out over time better to just size up to be honest
3.0,"Bought an XL and it is ""snug"". I suppose that is why the description mentions ""slim"". oh well.<br />Like the color though. Will keep it."
3.0,my daughter tried them on and we chose to return them and get the other brand.
3.0,This is a pretty dress. However it's got armholes for a small child. The arm holes do not match the size of the dress. I wear a large. The arm holes should be the size for a small dress junior size dress. The material is rough but pretty
3.0,"These are great for driving in low light - not particularly at night, but in rain, sleet, and snow, the visibility seems enhanced by quite a bit.  They are pretty cheaply made, however, as you would expect by the price.  The frames have fixed hinges but the polarized lens is decent with minimal distortion and the glare from headlights is reduced quite a bit.  They do come from China and if you think you are getting Gant, don't delude yourself.  The case came stamped with GAMT."
3.0,They are kind of big but that’s fine I’ll rock them big and all
3.0,"Sadly the hat was way too shallow and ended about 1.5"" above the ear. And I don't even have a big head.<br /><br />The color and the material were great though."
3.0,Decent Vera Bradley knock off style purse.
3.0,neck is on the small size
3.0,For the lost part the dress fit well but it wasn’t the quality I was looking for.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this, but its not particularly well made. The collar is not stitched to the inside so the seam comes out and I have to keep tucking it in."
3.0,Very nice I gave it to my grandmother as a birthday 🎁 loved it so much I want one for myself
3.0,"I like the color but it was too tight. Felt like it was made for kids. My head is small and this was too tight. If I try to stretch it, I feel it will break.<br />Too tight because it was giving me a headache.<br />A bit disappointed. I was looking forward of using it to work since I work in the operating room."
3.0,"Not a huge difference, but works ok"
3.0,These are warm but not at all water proof - but nice.
3.0,"Very pretty and shiny, but NOT sterling silver as the description repeatedly states. There is no stamping anywhere on the pendant or the bail of the pendant (such as .925) indicating it is sterling silver. It does not feel like silver. It is only when you drill down into the hidden details window that you find out the pendant base is ""metal."" Which means it can be anything. Very pretty; I can't fault it one bit on its beauty, but keep in mind it is costume jewelry, and there's no way to know if it will stay pretty or even be durable."
3.0,Material is fairly thin
3.0,Beautiful glasses.  They are too big though so I will have to give them to a friend.
3.0,"I ordered women's gloves and received men's, but they are really nice"
3.0,"It is not sweatshirt material. I am 5’5, 150 lbs, and bought a size large. It is form fitting and has little stretch. It is a thin material,  but that’s fine as I live in FL so that won’t be a problem. It is a mini-dress, gets to about the upper thighs and as you move it just gets shorter. Most likely will be wearing it as a tunic. I like the design of the dress just wish it was about 3 inches longer."
3.0,"I was looking for the color: got it. I was looking for along strap: got it. Something casual and lightweight: got it. What I wanted and didn't get is a place to hold my driver's license, bank cards, other cards, etc. I really do like it, but I have to buy another, smaller wallet, for my money and my cards. I won't buy this again, but I'm mostly happy with it."
3.0,"This is a cute bag - nice design, very good price, arrived in good condition. But the ""faux leather"" strap is more like cardboard construction. It is so unattractive, I won't be using the bag. I rated ""three stars"" because of the good service by the seller, but remember...you get what you pay for."
3.0,Liked the shirt but it runs small. I wish I had went up a size and it would habeen more comfy.
3.0,Sent back twice. Calf was too small and second pair strap broke but I love the material. Real leather soft and comfortable
3.0,Great size but stains all my cards and clothes brown from dye
3.0,Looks good. Just sucks im missing about 10 parts. I can still gage up but ill have to missmatch ... Lame
3.0,can get broken pretty easy
3.0,I love the idea of this necklace… but the pendant is absolutely massive. I was hoping it would be a lot smaller than it is.
3.0,"The watch band and face cover are very pretty, but the protective glass broke the very first time it fell on the floor and after wearing it for less than a week the design is peeling off of the band"
3.0,"I see many other comments now saying that their vest was a cheap quality and that the insignia on the back was extremely small. Mine, however, is made of great quality material and has a large insignia, about 6 inches at least, on the back. It looks just like in the show. The only thing I agree with is that the pockets on the front aren't pockets, just lumps with buckles that give the impression of pockets. Also, I ordered a Large and it doesn't fit exactly well. It's snug around my waist and really loose around my breasts. But, it isn't too horrible. My biggest complaint was that it took almost 2 months to get it because it was stolen during delivery. I was expecting some sort of refund or coupon or something considering I ordered it for Halloween and it came during Christmas, but they gave me nothing which was a disappointment."
3.0,"Like the look and material, wish it had a little stretch to it because I have thick arms. It fits, but right on arms. I'll probably add some fabric to the sleeves."
3.0,I was a little disappointed when I first received concerned that the clasp would not hold up.  I bought it for a gift.
3.0,"The shirt and jacket are big in the body so I recommend a size down. Unfortunately, they are also short so sizing down may create issues with length. The jacket DOES NOT have the SU Star lining, it's just pink fleece. Other than fit and picture misrepresentation it is pretty good. It is sewn very well and keeps you nice and warm. I keep it as a house sweater since the fit makes me look 30 lbs heavier."
3.0,Se habré sola
3.0,nice and hot Gloves
3.0,I like the dress but the pockets ripped the material.
3.0,THEY ARE FINE.
3.0,"I can only wear for a little bit , hard to put on and we'll it cut into my leg at the top . Other that they felt nice for as long as I could stand them . Went but the measurements they gave too."
3.0,"Great hat,  it was just soooo big."
3.0,"Nice material; light & soft. However, shirts are inconsistent. Ordered XXL; a red long sleeve & a black long sleeve. Red is what was pictured (and same style I had previously ordered months ago in white.) Black was about 3"" shorter & did not have the slits in the sides at the bottom; it was much more snug."
3.0,"I want to love this cover-up, however, for tall girls it acts more like a shirt. I’m still impressed by the quality and the lace details on the bodice and sleeves really are pretty. Even though it was a tad too short, I still wore it on my recent vacation. It will look cute with jeans or shorts as a top!"
3.0,"After a couple 3 weeks and wearing it 4 times, one of the bumblebee came off. 😫 so it got returned. 🤷🏾‍♀️ But besides that, it was a nice band."
3.0,I received 10 pairs. Which was nice. But I also didn't get the skulls. Instead a got a batman symbol.  Not really what I wanted.<br />I have pretty thin earlobes so I wish the bar in the middle.of the fake plugs was shorter.  It would give a more snug look. Although I realize it would be snug on someone else with thicker lobes.<br />They did arrive on time and packaged fine though.<br />We'll see how my ears react to this metal.
3.0,"Love the color. I wish the fabric was thicker so my black leggings didn't show through. This fabric also wrinkles easily.  It will be fine under a jacket or cardigan. For me, too thin to wear solo."
3.0,"Sleeves are a different fabric than the body of the shirt. Will end up using it as a yoga cover up. Bought a large, fits like a US size 4 small"
3.0,"I usually wear a medium for everything but since I didn’t have the option to request a medium I got the large and I’m glad I did because I don’t think a medium would have closed. I’m 5’2 148 and wear size medium for tops. So when I used it for the first time I noticed its really tight around the waist but loose around the belly and the shoulder straps. Although it’s loose around the belly, the Velcro straps help to tighten it up. As for the shoulder straps I found it really annoying that it fit loose. It kinda just floated over my shoulder and while I worked out it kept moving and rubbing on my skin irritating it. I’m not sure if a medium would solve that problem since like I said it fits me pretty tight around the waist I don’t think it would close. Other than that it did what’s its supposed to do I had so much sweat everywhere this covered."
3.0,There is about an inch of space around the heel and spacey at the top. They seem to run big. I could have used an 8 1/2. I think I'm going to return them and that's too bad because I really like the style of the shoe.
3.0,I find this hat to slippery for my head...<br />gave it away
3.0,Works for like a one time thing also protect your poor nipples this thing is ruthless. Looses stickiness after first use
3.0,Love Big Cat Rescue but was sad when the medal tarnished in a few weeks.
3.0,The dress I received is not the dress that is pictured.
3.0,"My wife likes the socks they are cute. Would be better if you could pick the colors we got 2 prs of the same color. They fit good and are comfortable, but one pair was unraveling at the toe seam. They did arrive over a week early and are worth the price that you pay from them."
3.0,Definitely NOT touchscreen gloves. They’re regular gloves. The whole set is a simple set that you can find anywhere. The only difference is that the hat and neck scarf is line with a plush material. It’s very soft. The set does keep you warm. The hat isn’t large although it stretches. The scarf also isn’t large. It doesn’t drape as it does in the picture. Overall it’s a nice set but simple and not a lot of money needs to be spent on it. It’s basic.
3.0,Fits comfortable nice and breathable hood is bigger then expected though.
3.0,Zipper is pretty weak. Do NOT pull the zipper hard up when you're zipping it up since one of mine broke.
3.0,"These are comfortable pants but very high wasted! Definitely above the naval. Your photo does not picture them that way. I know high wasted is coming back but to lounge around my house I prefer to just be comfortable. Otherwise, nice and comfy fabric."
3.0,"i guess it felt a little cheap,, half size bigger then my normal 6.5.<br /><br />the butterfly is like a plastic and was a little crumpled.. but it was still ok.. probably wont buy again.. just different when u try it on and see it yourself.<br /><br />good if you need it for a costume or something like that"
3.0,"They feel kind of cheap, like they could break at any mintue"
3.0,Tie strings are REALLY long. Hard to hang up because belt hits the floor.
3.0,I ordered a medium and was too big to perform a compression so I returned it . I'm going to have to order a small
3.0,The snap keeps coming undone and I finally lost the watch in a parking lot and it got run over.  All I have left is the leather band.
3.0,Way to big but beautiful shirt
3.0,Was not a 2x. More like a 1x. Nice style and color.
3.0,"The rotation is pretty smooth, but they sent the wrong ring (something inspirational in hebrew, which is neat but not as nerdy zelda as I was hoping)"
3.0,Recieved the wrong size
3.0,Looks cute after some minor alterations had to use a safety pin to close top
3.0,"I'm 5' 4&#34; and the small fell to below my butt. Very loose, soft fabric. The body of the shirt feels cottony and the sleeves feel like spandex but are loose and still soft. It's just SO. LONG."
3.0,Didn't like the material but my daughter did she likes it... so I gave it to her
3.0,"I love the pattern of the dress and fabric, but unfortunately it was too large to keep. I normally wear and S/M and ordered a M after reading reviews, but I could have possibly worn a XS. If the feel of the fabric wasn't so rough, I would consider exchanging for a smaller size."
3.0,Buckle is NOT removable.
3.0,Way smaller than shown
3.0,"It’s a cute pattern,  but definitely not high waisted. I’m 5’4 and it didn’t even cover my belly button.. probably going to send back"
3.0,"Only came with 2 eyelets, not three as pictured!!!"
3.0,"Order one size bigger, returned it for the next size up."
3.0,Just.. no....<br />Too big (almost fits my adult head)<br />Too thick (material)<br />Too long (the strings)
3.0,Cute but reeked of vinegar! Definitely wash before you use:-/
3.0,Fit as discribed. My son loves his. The only bummer is. I washed it once and the sweatshirts cord afraid very easily.
3.0,It was a little big/low in the front but it fit really well around the bust.
3.0,Size up...too small and too short.  Sent back for refund
3.0,"Very pretty and perfect for my daith.  I have purchased 2 and one worked fine but the other clicker needs to be switched out since it didn't open without using force and I can't close it at all. One was a faulty and the other one is perfect,  hence my rating is a 3 star."
3.0,"When I got this I was a bit disappointed. From the pictures I was lead to believe that there would be two compartments. One for the checkbook stuff and one for money and cards. There isn't. Also, when I put my checkbook in it, with the register and cards, it wouldn't close. I can still use it, but highly let down. Wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be."
3.0,They are ok for dollar store glasses but not roomy enough for my prescription glasses and sunglasses that do not lay very flat. So too small.
3.0,Toy handcuffs with cloth fuzzy covering.
3.0,"Love this set. I just wished the quality was a little better. One of them ripped the first day I wore it when I was taking it off. I guess you get what you pay for. Other than that, they are really cute."
3.0,The belt is wide and high quality.  The buckle is a defining feature.  I noted the buckle was assembled on the belt backwards so the loop is on the inside and buckle hold pin is on the opposite side not allowing the belt to stay in place when tightened.
3.0,This product came in a timely manner. It doesn't look as I expected it. The fabric is a bit thin. My daughter wanted this for her prom. I would not purchase this item again... however it does fit nicely!
3.0,"quality is not as great as i expected it would be, but it’s still nice."
3.0,such a nice blouse but it fitted me to small..
3.0,"I should've read the product description. By looks alone, I thought this hat was black in color -- it's navy blue, but still, it's a nice hat and the grim reaper stitching is a cool touch. The thing that annoys me, though, is that for such an expensive hat, ( $22 after shipping) this thing is TIGHT, and I don't exactly have a large head. One accidental cycle in the dryer will render this hat useless to me. This must be for kids or something."
3.0,"I love this dress. When I tried it on it was too small. However the quality is good. These dresses runs small, I would suggest to get a size or two sizes  up. I am a 5&#34;7 weight 142 lbs. And medium was way too small for me"
3.0,"Very very small, my drivers license barely fits in the slot & it’s quite a workout to get it out once it’s in there. The zippered pocket will barely hold a couple folded dollars & again, once I get it in there it’s difficult to get it out. I wish it was slightly bigger, I would’ve bought for family members like me who don’t like to carry pocketbooks or any tote bags. Also, not the best quality of materials."
3.0,It is ok. It is by far very cheap fabric.
3.0,Only problem I have with these is due to the magnetic clasps they stick to my laptop and shut it off in the middle of me working on it.
3.0,It was okay. A little snug but not unwearable.
3.0,"The dress was pretty but sleeves fit too tight on my fat arms. I ordered an XL and normally wears a size 16-18, but this one fitted too snug to wear to a wedding. Did not like the patch pockets on the skirt. So I had to return this item."
3.0,"While I loved the look of the product, it was a LOT smaller than I thought. The male (bigger version) is only the size of my thumb nail. and the chain is too short. its like a choker on me. I'm a pretty average sized person, so it made me kind of sad. I can't just change the chain, since its attached so im not really sure what to do with it. The female one is the size of my pinky nail, and you can barely tell im even wearing it. I really don't want to return it since i doubt they have a bigger version, but im just kind of sad....but it still looked wonderful!!"
3.0,"I like the watch, but the day and month are to small to read."
3.0,Runs smaller than indigo ones I have purchased.
3.0,Get one size larger
3.0,"I was expecting actual compression. Nothing like it, the material is comfortable but does not so what it's listed for. It's just like a normal shirt."
3.0,"The actual cover up is super big, and the top is a bit bigger as well. Bottoms were a bit snug. When I was swimming and diving into the lake, the top went up and almost flashed everyone. Additionally the pads will probably need to be sewed in, other wise they can slide up top so that it looks weird."
3.0,"its ok comes in a nice gift box, not sure what granps is going to do with it"
3.0,Very tight in the arms. Also very clingy fabric.
3.0,It’s ok👍🏽
3.0,"Such a cute little charm. Unfortunately, the silver color rubbed off of the raised surfaces within two weeks."
3.0,"Cannot easily have this strap and the over the neck strap work together.  Plus when I put them together, the hand grip strap did slip thru, but I caught the camera in time.  Obviously, my error, but need to figure it out.  Strap instructions and fit are a bit involved."
3.0,Nice. Heavy but nice. Not like what came in Fab Fit Fun box.
3.0,Buena pero no se aprecia por qué queda muy chica con el reloj
3.0,"Very cute style. Zipper didn’t seem to be great quality, got stuck opening it, but was a nice packable down. Liked the length, fur didn’t look overly fake or anything. Just ran very small. I’m 5’5, a solid 22/24W, and as you can see in the photo this was at least  8” short of closing, let alone being large enough to wrap like the model. She must be a size 00 wearing the 3X to do that. Liked it but going back."
3.0,It didn't fit and I didn't like the material so I sent it back
3.0,My son like the shoes and I have the item on time
3.0,"26 wks pregnant, 162 lbs, 5'7 tall<br /><br />I really liked the colors, pattern, and fit (the length was okay with flats on but I wouldn't recommend it with heels/wedges) - BUT I had to return the dress because in the places in which the material gets stretched, i.e. belly and back, the navy turned white - almost making it seem like it is see-through when it isn't. I also didn't like how the stitching looked stretched because I felt that the dress wasn't too tight on me, neither did I like how low the line below the bust is (where the &#34;belt&#34; goes). All of that made the dress look cheap in my opinion. Going a size up would have made it too saggy, so I opted to return it instead of exchanging it"
3.0,"Way to sheer, beautiful but had to wear slip and camisole so defeated the purpose of a sun dress. I had to wear two layers"
3.0,pretty but look better in picture
3.0,No shape. Fitting was too loose.
3.0,"I was excited to get this bra. Nice design. Nothing fancy I just wanted an everyday type of bra. I'm a 36C. I had to attach in in the last hook because it felt tight. Cup seemed ok even tho my boobs looked like the they spilling a little lol. I wore it all day running errands. At times, it felt like it was pinching my skin and I would pull it. Then, nighttime when I went to take a shower I had marks all over. I never have that with my other bras😔"
3.0,"way smaller than expected, especially for the price"
3.0,There was some kind of error in mind and I had to unhook and hook some things back so the main chain that goes around the head could be tighter than the ones that dangle below it. A hassle to fix but looked great once I did. I'm only using it once for a costume so hopefully it doesn't break apart.
3.0,Received this item. It was nicely packaged and beautifully put together but the letter where backwards.
3.0,Measurements were much smaller than said. Really cute but had to give it away because of the fit. Shipping was fast!
3.0,"This is the 2nd watch I've order from this specific brand and the SECOND time the instructions for clasp removal have left me with a pile of pieces! The instructions they gave me had a watch that didn't even look like mine. HOWEVER, it is really pretty and it's quite big so I knee going in I'd have to take out 2 links, I do like it enough to take it to a jeweler to get it put back together. So am i annoyed, yes. Do I like the watch, also yes soooo I guess you have yo ask yourself, are you confident in your watch removal skills?<br /><br />I am not."
3.0,The wire in the back  came out two hours of wearing  it
3.0,"I love this bag!  It is my daily driver for work!  You can also use it like  an overnight bag.  I give it 3 stars because of all the little pockets it has, not one was designed as a pen holder - which I daily need.<br /><br />After designating one of the pockets to pens, the pens poked a hole in the lining.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this bag, and use it every day...  but will continue to look for another bag that has the qualities this one offers, plus a pen holder."
3.0,"I received this of yesterday, I ordered this in Nov. And it is not what I ordered. It has big white enamel eyes with black spots for eyes. There are no crystal eyes. Looks find of freakish. It is made well. Cool if it had crystal eyes. U be the judge."
3.0,"Not as advertised. The black dye is very faded, as if it had been washed and dried many times. The bag itself has a funky smell, like mold, like someone owned this and then returned it."
3.0,Really cute pattern but the fabric isn’t very soft.
3.0,It ran small- I’m needing to buy a size or two larger than what I usually buy.
3.0,Gloves fits small... if you wear a large you may want to up a size XL
3.0,My usual size large was too small. Exchanged fo an XL and size was perfect
3.0,I'm 5'1&#34; and about 127 and and pretty athletic. The size small is like a boat on me. I prefer to have this type of dress be a bit shorter and more form fitting. It was not what I was expecting and the fabric is a bit heavy for my liking.
3.0,"Really cute, but very fragile."
3.0,Does not look as beautiful as it does in the photo. Fits larger than expected.
3.0,"Had the seller given more info such as the measurements of the bail's opening, this item would really sell. Not knowing this key info, makes customers uncertain as to whether or not it will fit on their chains."
3.0,"The picture showed a definite blue belt, but it is not. It is not as well made as other stretch belts I have purchased. Will see how it wears..."
3.0,The wrist bad is very small.. I am a very normal size male ( 5' 9'' 170lbs) and I am on the last whole in the band.
3.0,Looks like the photo. Green gray blend. Good cheap bracelet. I love bracelets.. I m not so sure about recommending to a friend though.
3.0,Stretched out too soon
3.0,"Way, way till I small."
3.0,I am an XL in bathing suits. The bottoms were too small. Sent it back.
3.0,Returned this blouse.
3.0,I buy a lot if Ryka sneakers. These were a huge disappointment.  Not the most comfortable. The color.is nice though.
3.0,"I expected a 7"" inch herringbone chain. The chain includes a 1 inch extender. What I got is a 7 inch chain that includes the extender. If I'd known I'd have got a longer bracelet."
3.0,Too large for ladies.  I wear a size 7 ladies glove & these are too BIG.  My thumb pops out the slit & the mitten covering is bulky just too large.  They are OK for driving to work in the morning.  They are warm & seem well made just super big for my small hands.
3.0,These have a layer of cotton and polyester. Needs to be just cotton.
3.0,"They are nice, however; one pair of earrings had the hooks incorrectly put on, so I could not use them"
3.0,The clasp is  made for TINY fingers. I had to use tweezers to put it around my friend's neck
3.0,Its ok but not a sweater.  Tshirt material
3.0,"Sometimes these socks will slip off into my shoe. Very annoying!<br />I wear a size 8, so it's not like my feet are huge."
3.0,"Nice hat, way to big."
3.0,"Wore them once with my boots and one of the buttons fell off and I accidentally crushed it under my boot and am unable to sew it back on. Other than that, these look really nice. You might want to sew around the button, though, to insure yours does not fall off like mine."
3.0,"I originally brought these for my teenage son but somehow I fell in love and kept them for myself. They definitely keep my feet warm. Like other socks they shrink when you wash them, but they still fit. Maybe I'll wash them and not dry them. I would say they get like lent balls but that's not exactly what I mean. Its like when something gets stuck to hard part of velcro and it looks fuzzy afterwards. That's how the heel of the foot of the socks look."
3.0,Not real comfortable ay all. They hirt after about an hour of wearing
3.0,The texture is not of good quality
3.0,I likes the sleeves the torsovis too short
3.0,"These go above my knee sometimes and mid-knee depending on the day. Either one is not very comfortable and when I fold them down below my knee, it’s a lot of pressure. I have Go2socks in camo, medium compression, and those are the prefect length. Not sure why these are so long.<br /><br />If you are tall, then these might work for you. They wash well and I still feel the compression after multiple washes."
3.0,"My daughter loved the watched but unfortunately the &#34;pleather&#34; broke at the pin, four days after receiving it. She only got to wear it twice. I sent it back.<br /><br />**Update** 11/30/2017 - Recently I was sent a replacement watch, stating that the quality has improved. So far so good! My 10 year old daughter has worn the watch off and on since her birthday on Nov 20th, and hasn't had any issues. She loves it, so I am happy."
3.0,I love the design and style however the color gold of the lace part doesn't match the gold metal part.  Other than that if fits as expected and lays nicely.
3.0,"Pants seem to be of good quality, but run a little small, and way smaller than the size chart on the description page.  It is way too soon to comment on quality or durability."
3.0,"The photo and description were misleading. I expected round pearls, and received long oval shaped ones. Not what I was going for.😞customer service worked hard and informed me the round pearls were no longer available. The pearls are very nice and I decided to keep them."
3.0,Toe ring that doesn’t stay face up constantly having to move it over
3.0,Too Thin. can't even handle 3 cards.
3.0,They were bigger than I had expected them to be. They were nice.
3.0,For the price it's a good deal but I feel the quality could be a little better. It just didn't have enough card holder spots I think it has like one for your id and that's it. But if it's for a teenager and not a grown man it's perfect
3.0,Returned this bag as it did not meet my needs.
3.0,"I like it over all but on the face of it there is a small paint bubble kind of sucks  for what i paid to get it like that.,"
3.0,just a little too big
3.0,Looks nice but too thin. Size is much smaller than expected.
3.0,Its ok..
3.0,More feminine then i expected. There is a little design on the piece that goes over the nose.
3.0,It looks a little wire up close vs online. Ot is very shiny and silky looking and it does still got that elegant type look o was hoping for. I got a XXL and I normally where medium/large or 7/9.
3.0,"End up returning the dress because l didn’t like the fabric is to thin, the color is accurate and the size but not my favorite"
3.0,I ordered this heart pendant although it looks not much like the picture it is high quality and a beautiful piece it is a chunkier pendant but still a nice item shipped as expected
3.0,"The blue is a nice long loose dress and I love the pockets. But the one in your picture starts with white at the top and has the blue starting several inches down. The one I received starts with blue at the top — which isn't nearly as neat looking. I really liked the ""look"" – you had it in the picture; but it isn't the same in the actual dress. I'm thinking about whether or not to return it.<br />The brown is okay, too, but it's five inches too long. So if I keep it, I'll need to cut off several inches.<br />Thinking.... thinking...thinking."
3.0,It was a gift for my cousin it was her birthstone  -ish.  She says she loved it. I know she  is used to finer things but it was a hit anyway. My only issue is that it was a larger scale than it appeared to be
3.0,It didn’t turn out to be the same brand I thought I was buying BUT they were much more inexpensive and they fit nice.
3.0,Super cute shoes. They are a little snug for my liking!
3.0,"I bought 4 of these straps in different colors. first they look good, sturdy and fancy but after a long oversea trip, one was broken off during the returning trip. now end up w/ 3 left and this is the reason they got 3 stars. these straps come with TSA combination lock so they are perfect. also it was a peace of mind using them since I know my luggages will not break open during the trip. these strap also help minimized from someone to break open your zipper and steal stuff during transportation. please note I said minimize not eliminate. yes I would recommend this product"
3.0,Ordered a large based on the reviews which is the normal size I would wear. Disappointed because it arrived ripped on the shoulder area.
3.0,It's a bit large and unflattering for me personally but still a nice coverup. It was a one size fits all deal...so I wasn't able to reorder in a smaller size or I would have.
3.0,My boyfriend ordered this dress for me for my graduation for tomorrow I’m so Sad this dress fits me big. Love the dress but a medium would of fit perfect.
3.0,Cheap quality fabric that attracts every fuzz and pet hair like a magnet. Also it fit small and was way too uncomfortable to dance in. Capezio used to be a great company. No more.
3.0,"Material too stiff, looked ill fitted and boxy"
3.0,This is not stamped but it could still be sterling silver. The charm is pitted and rough and sooooo much tarnish. Used a silver polish compound and the charm looks a lot better. But it is still dull.
3.0,"The adult size tee runs very small.  I had to return it, which they were great about and didn't take the product back, but refunded me my money.  I ordered 2 sizes up and it is still too small - the shirts run very tight!  Also, the second order I received the color lots are different and don't match the color of the child tee."
3.0,theyre earrings
3.0,"would have out 5 starts but when I got it in the mail, there was a diamond missing"
3.0,Loved how this shoe looks but was not expecting a hard sole.  Thought it would be more flexible.
3.0,They fit nice and looked like they do in the picture.  The only problem was my glasses reflected off of the lenses and I saw the frame of my RX glasses in the lenses of these sunglasses.  So sad because I really liked the color and style.
3.0,should have known better
3.0,I am usually a medium dress but ordered large based on the reviews and pics. The large was just a tad too snug for my taste but the fabric and length was great. I am returning. I think the xl will be too large but large was not the fit I wanted for my curves.
3.0,They’re great for any time. But wish the backs  fit better. Hate losing the earring.
3.0,I loved the color and the softness of the t shirt! Loved the shirt but I ordered size  XX and it is on the tighter side and very clingy material.
3.0,"I should have returned these. They seem to be the right size, but after wearing them for just a couple of hours, they hurt my feet. They're cute, but not functional for me. I'm hoping I can stretch the toe area to give me a little more room in that part of the boot."
3.0,"the fit was a bit small except the thumb which was twice the size of the index finger.. super long, but served its intended purpose for one picture. if going for true costume quality, look elsewhere."
3.0,These fit like I expected but the bra padding moves around and comes out when you wash them.
3.0,These are not Cotton at all they are made out of the same stuff a bathing suit is made of shiny Stretchy polyester
3.0,It’s very loose on top and too tight  above the knees
3.0,Nice dress and good material but returning because it's not fitting as it should. Will re-order in a bigger size.
3.0,material was not great...was snug.
3.0,"After I posted my initial review (below), this company connected me and immediately offered to ship a replacement band. And followed through with their offer. Kuddos & an extra star for great customer service! It's still  too heavy for my petite wrist, but I gave it to a friend to try.<br /><br />Original review, 2 stars:<br />Had to return. Band had two different ends.  One end is too wide to connect to the watch. Band itself feels sturdy though. Might be a bit wide/heavy for a petite women's wrist."
3.0,"I was a little disappointed with product.  The elastic waistband is too tight; the length is excessive; and I don't like the button in the flap. Otherwise, OK."
3.0,Top is cute but the pants look nothing like the picture! It looks like someone cut squares in the pants! I could've made this at home! The top is really cute though but the pants are a no no ..
3.0,great style.
3.0,I ordered the XXL based on the reviews. I wear size 12 petite 35&#34; waist. These jeans are to big in the waist by a few inches. The thighs fit but the calves are way to tight. My guess is they would fit a tall slinder size 14 to 16. The material is stretchy and they look just like the picture. The buttons are very hard to fit through the button holes. In all if they fit me and the buttons worked I would wear them happily.
3.0,"I'm a size 4, 5'3&#34; and 130lbs. They advertise that this will fit up to a size 12. That is simply not true, unless a size 12 wants a skin-tight shirt. I had a little room in this shirt but not much and it did not go long enough to even cover my butt properly. This is a shirt, not a proper cover-up."
3.0,I ordered a pair and loved them but ended up ordering another pair due to the fact that the magnet that helps hold them together besides the posts gets pretty loose.
3.0,This is a replica of a Stella & Dot piece.  The S&D version is much more coral and pink. This one the stones are more yellow. But after I got over that I am really enjoying wearing the necklace. It is made of high quality metals. My only complaint is the assembly.  It gets a little twisted and the loops that connect the pieces are not properly closed so I find that it pricking my skin at different areas. I've had to take it apart a little bit to correct. If more care was placed and actually assembling the necklace I think it would be great.
3.0,Super cute but def size up a size or 2
3.0,I’ve had some lined training pants that are by this brand and came in a pack with non lined training pants. These are different. They are noisy when my LO walks. The others I had were not but were still protective against leaks.  It seems like the lining in these is a cheaper/lower quality plastic that is so noisy I wouldn’t put these on my toddler to go out of the house in.
3.0,It's was not what I expect
3.0,"This dress fits really well. I bought it for a Halloween party and it worked really well as princess Leia. The dress is really soft. The one thing that I don't like is how short it is, I have to wear a pair of leggings or my bottom will show. Otherwise it is a decent purchase for what it was used for."
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet, but I have not been able to open the clasp!"
3.0,"They are ok. I like the colors and the look of them, but they are thinner than I expected. They also, oddly, make my feet sweat a lot. So I slide around in my boots when I wear these. They are a blister waiting to happen."
3.0,was not happy with the way it hangs
3.0,Very comfortable shorts until you put the phone in the pocket. Has a tendency to pull your shorts down and the phone bangs against your leg when you walk.
3.0,"This blouse was suppose to be a large, more like a medium, not tags were attached. Very disappointing in size. Color is nice."
3.0,not as larger in person as in the image posted
3.0,"I like the way it looks and is ideally supposed to fit; I might be able to stretch it out a bit. It runs a bit small length wise, so that I really have to pull on the halter straps to get the suit up high enough. I feel like it's either cut lower than I'd like or it's too short from neckline to crotch. I'm 5'3&#34; and about 155lbs; I ordered a large."
3.0,Bigger than I expected. Sits too far/tall off my nose and snags everything. Its okay for the price and did not break me out but I likely wont ever wear it again
3.0,"The fit is perfect, the material sucks and it's see through when dry, let alone wet."
3.0,"This is a cute item, but I realize it will have to be replaced soon as this product is constructed from very cheap materials.....<br />I WILL NOT order from this vendor again....."
3.0,"Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly ""pretty"" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.  I'm very disappointed and will probably not seek out their products as I have over the years.  Too bad."
3.0,The looks of the t-shirt is awesome but the are cut small and short so it doesn’t fit well
3.0,i like but there is a weird effect - distortion that affects the view
3.0,Beautiful color. OK quality. Runs large. Fine for work.
3.0,"glasses are smaller than I expected. a good look, but more akin to the john lennon look. fyi..."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this blazer. The color is just what I wanted. My first disappointment was that it was extremely wrinkled. The wrinkles did not hang out so I washed it and the wrinkles remained. Washed it again, no change. The care label clearly states, ""do not bleach, iron, dry clean or tumble dry"".<br /><br />The second disappointment was that the cut of the jacket did not fit my body. It flared out at the hips, the front darts were not in the right location and it just looked like it belonged on another body. I ordered my  regular size - Large for 5'8'' 158 pounds."
3.0,"I really liked this dress, but returned it. The quality of the skirted part was not that great and one of the pleats faced the opposite direction of the others."
3.0,"Bought for a 9 year old's birthday. This is great for a kid, but probably wouldn't work well for an adult. The entire purse is like a hollowed out stuffed animal with a zipper added. I can see the zipper getting stuck in the fur if used a lot. The chain for the purse is nice and long and seemed like good quality."
3.0,Looks as expected. Just very thin material
3.0,Great color.  Very small and light weight.
3.0,The earrings are a nice color. Sometimes can be tricky opening them.
3.0,"Eh. I could take 'em or leave 'em. Not my favorite pair, not the worst pair ever. Nothing special here."
3.0,while I love the pattern the latch is bad on both and does not hook. not again
3.0,they came cracked
3.0,"Love the colors and fit, but a little see through. Many reviews said they weren't so I was surprised to find they were on the thin side."
3.0,this was so-so..and sort of over priced as I saw the same exact necklace at Walmart gor one-third the cost..
3.0,Very cute!  All fit my 9 month old's head great except the red one is very small and was cutting into her head. Bummer because red was the one I would like to use the most.
3.0,The chain it's too fake
3.0,"The sweater it's baggy-squeary and lose. The fabric is fine. The color it's not accuerate, I bought the green one, in the pics look like a nice green, but it turns out to be a really deep green, so know I own a baggy sweatear that looks like a bad style grandma sweater. I won't recomend this product."
3.0,"The bottoms fit relatively well but the top was slightly large. I am 5'9/5'10 and 129 lbs/32 D cup and ordered a medium & felt I could go a little smaller in the top, and a little larger in the bottoms. However, I still kept the suit and rated it 3 stars because the quality is very nice & it does come with cups, but I may replace them for thicker cups!"
3.0,Missing the one item in picture was replaced with less desirable mask
3.0,cool hat fun to wear only problem was the string that fastens to your chin poorly manufactured tore off first time I used it other than that issue every thing else is well manufactured.
3.0,Super cute but no support.
3.0,One of the socks was smaller than the other
3.0,Lo compre para el gym pero da cierta picazón al frotarla contra la piel cuando haces fuerza en la bancas de pesa
3.0,SUPER SUPER Small. Even with ordering a size up. See through even on a smaller friend. But cute. Still going to return.
3.0,Great colors but I’ve a small wrist and it wouldn’t adjust tight enough.  A friend got a nice band for her watch though.
3.0,They are comfortable and have nice looking. If the quality improves it will be perfect.
3.0,Solo un poco
3.0,wish I could have fit it
3.0,"Decent quality but runs small. Definietly order a size up, especially if you have a larger bosom. I normally wear a 5 or 26/27 in jeans & a 34D bra."
3.0,"Bought these for vacation to the Caribbean. They are pretty cute, the thread isnt as even as the pictures show."
3.0,"It's a decent purchase, but my only gripe are the buttons. They are sewn on with what feels like low grade embroidery floss; moreover, the buttons are so loosely secured that you can see the threads of the stitch poking out through the button holes when the shirt is fastened. The buttons themselves are nice, but they seem I'll fitted for a shirt of this material with such poor threading."
3.0,"They are cute boots. They were only $20 so I took a risk. I usually wear 10.5, which most places don't make so I order up to an 11. These fit like a 10 (before adding insoles). I can wear them with no issues as long I don't have to walk around in them. They definitely need insoles, the footbed has no cushioning at all. I added some gel insoles, and they are fine to wear for short periods. I am hoping they will be more comfortable after I get them &#34;broke in&#34;. Order up one size if you can."
3.0,"Not a bad replacement for my Oakleys.  The downside with them is that they are thinner than real oakley lenses. The bigger issue I have with them is the clarity.  The lenses are colored so you see whatever color you are looking  through. Mine are green and blue so when I'm looking forward I see green and if my eyes focus left or right everything shifts and takes on a blue tint.  Its a minor annoyance but something that Oakley lenses never did.  Finally, the color I  received doesn't totally match what the picture shows. The lenses I received have more of a green and red coloring instead of Green and blue."
3.0,It's like a giant maroon potato sack...
3.0,"This necklace is definitely cheap looking.  It looks like one you would see hanging on the rack next to the cash register in one of those discount Asian stores.  It would make a nice stocking stuffer for a kid, but I don't think too many adults will want to wear it.  The chain is really cheap and not as good as cheap gold plating.  I don't know how much it costs but I wouldn't want to spend more than 5 or 6 dollars for it.  The stone is unpolished pink quartz and for the most part is nice looking.  I don't know if it will permanently stay attached to the chain or not.  Don't give this to your girlfriend as a serious gift or she will see how cheap you are."
3.0,"On one of the shoes after using for 2 weeks the sole at the back heal started to peel off. Also,on the toe area there was a slight distortion. The product is very glamourous and I love them and many people also say they look really good."
3.0,It was a nice looking charm on my phone case.  Problem is loop that attaches to phone is very thin. Lost the charm after 2 days as the loop was loose and it came off of my safesleeve case.  Very disappointed
3.0,Very nice dress I got small but way too big! Size off! Retuned I’m 5 2 and 110lbs
3.0,"Bought for under work uniform, 32d in black, a little small, functioning bra, happy with purchase."
3.0,"Well, I took the advice of others and was sure adding one size would be enough, but it wasn't.  This shoe ran about two sizes too small for my daughter.  We returned and will purchase the next size.  Add two sizes if you are ordering."
3.0,This one has a bit of an ill cut and is not as indicated in the photo.  It drapes like an older farmer's wife on a fence gossiping with the neighbor.  I wear this one when cooking because the apron holds the sloppy drapes back.
3.0,Horrible material but you get what you pay for. Good value at 5 bucks.
3.0,"Glad I ordered two of them- because Jesus wasn't even attached to one of them when the package arrived.<br />Otherwise, they seem to be heavy decent enough rosaries.. I think.  I'm not catholic, this is for costume use- but it appears to be of a sturdy quality (aside from the jesus being off of the one)"
3.0,"The design on the top of the ring fell off within a week.  I do like the style, but wish it was made of better quality materials."
3.0,The gaiter was to small. Grandchild could not use. Needed larger size
3.0,I bought the Ravenclaw tie. The blue is much more purple in person than it appears in the picture. I don't recommend it if you're going for any sort of movie accuracy. But it'll get the job done if you're just wearing it to a party.
3.0,"Nice skirt, pretty fabric, flattering, but it’s too long. Wanted it above my knee or mid thigh. I’m 5’2” and it hangs below my knee. Dang"
3.0,Ok gift
3.0,Cute but tiny and not work 6 dollars.
3.0,"warm, cute, but sizes are smaller then expected.  I usually wear a M/L.  I ordered a XL and it was too small. I am 6'"
3.0,"Ordered 2 different pairs from this company but this style was TOO small.  Definitely smaller than the other pair, which was the same size.  You sit down and it cuts off circulation to your legs.  If you can, definitely get it one size larger than you normally would."
3.0,"Great with a cardigan or denim jacket. Material moves nicely, but  is a little thin. Good purchase for price."
3.0,"The shirt is fine except for the fact that the sizes are entirely misleading.  I ordered a size large for my wife hoping that it would be a bit baggy for her to wear as a casual loafing around shirt.  When we got it appears to be a child's size large.  Wife is 5'4"" tall and not overweight.  We will give it to one of her ""smaller"" friends.  I would order at least 2, maybe 3 sizes bigger than you think you need."
3.0,Quality of the fabric is not up to par of the Lands End of 5 years ago.  Sent pants back.
3.0,"El modelo es bonito. La tela es ligera, perfecto para dias de verano. Se ajusta con botones en el centro. No tiene bolsillos. Mangas cortas.<br /><br />Si tienes las pompas grandes, este vestido no es un modelo adecuado ya que no se ajusta bien a las curvas. Es mas para personas muy delgadas sin curvas."
3.0,"The item fits fine and is of good quality, but as others said, it does reveal the wearer’s mid drift which is not depicted on the photo of the item worn by the model. It is good for hot yoga."
3.0,it is too big for me
3.0,"I really like it, but it's super small, doesn't come with a chain, and the holes to put the chain are so small that I had to bend the clasp to get it to fit. So good luck trying to find a chain that fits."
3.0,"This blanket scarf was a gift for a friend, and she did like it. But I personally was expecting a thicker and warmer material as it seems in the pictures. It is large but it's a bit thin and see through, more so like a pashmina. It's cute but not what I expected."
3.0,They are good shoes they just run small I order a size bigger then my foot but it still came to small
3.0,Did not like material<br />Looked like an American Flag not as cute as in pic
3.0,Worked well.  2 small bags are worthless but all others are good
3.0,"Socks are a little thin, don’t stay in place really well. Paws are thick & hurt to walk on."
3.0,Great for gift !
3.0,Some are really sharp. Other than that they're cute
3.0,It was very inexpensive so the quality reflects that. But the color and comfort is great. I was promised delivery July 6. It was delayed2 or 3 times and wasn't delivered until the 10th. After we left on our trip
3.0,Mas pequeños que en la foto
3.0,This just fit weird. Arm holes are too big. And the fabric is basically t-shirt material. Hides nothing. More of a summer beater dress than anything nice.
3.0,Was going to give them 5 stars but one shoe has a bulb out out on it and I just purchased them for Christmas. Disappointing because my daughter really loves them. My husband even wanted a pair.
3.0,I thought these watches were suppose to come in new. Mines was scratched from the clasp usually the Other brands I’ve ordered from on here they have protective plastic film around the watch for example I ordered a Michael Kors and I just received and it’s fully protected with this thin plastic around it which is great! Let’s me know it’s new. But this one looks like it might have been slightly used and then returned on the clasp it’s scratched like when you brush up against something. And I’m not a return person so I’m just going to keep it. I’m not one to be a difficult customer so I hate returning things. But I though it would be nice feedback for the next buyer to read. I am disappointed though for it to be COACH I thought they would ship their items in pristine condition .. guess not 😅
3.0,Order 2 sizes bigger . I bought a large . And it’s a lil small! And the tag says 4xl .
3.0,It looked very nice and fitting but The zipper was hard to get up. I couldn't keep it on the entire day. Because if I needed to use the bathroom a friend would have to come all with me to zip and unzip.
3.0,Hurt the top of the nose. I thought this would best quality.
3.0,same size I always wear but this  fits very big
3.0,"Although it does look a bit cheap since the eyeball is made of some sort of plastic, it is super cute. However, I do recommend that you don't wear it for super long periods of time since it'll irritate your skin. Also, if you have long hair, it is best that you tie up your hair, since this necklace easily gets tangled and it will hurt a lot to take off."
3.0,Uncomfortable but heavy duty.
3.0,Thought it was made of linen... disappointed.
3.0,Calf is too large. And shoe runs wide.
3.0,So cute🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,Fits ok a lil big
3.0,"They look cool, they compress but they’re not my favorite in terms of pregnancy compression socks. After awhile the top starts to dig into the back of the knee and they’re pretty high. It’s tight to the point that a muffin top appears around the thighs. The stretch could be better and they’re difficult to pull on and take off."
3.0,More like a cosmetic bag than a purse.
3.0,"I like the glove, but seams in between fingers tend to rub my skin. Possibly the fingers a little too narrow."
3.0,I ordered a small and should of ordered a size up so the robe/coverup would go all the way around me. I am 5”4 130 pounds and recommend a size up.
3.0,The sweater would be great if they were sized properly. The product description and the reviewers said the sweater ran small and to order one size up. Medium would be my size but I ordered a large and it was at least two sizes too small.
3.0,"Tnis hat is stylish in off white but seems to run a bit larger in size. However, the material is very hard and not easily conforming. I do not expect it to maintain its look for more than a few wears."
3.0,Cute necklace. But the description said dainty necklace and this is a huge charm! I wish it matched the description and was a little girly pendant but this is a huge pendent! Still cute but not my style.
3.0,Cute on this picture.Jeans are stretchy. The color isn't bright.  I returned.
3.0,One of them arrived broken which is disappointing but otherwise they’re pretty cool glasses.
3.0,Not what I was expecting. Paper thin. Actually don’t mind it since I live in South Carolina and it’s so hot here in the summer.
3.0,"Comes with a tool, but no instructions.  Uncertain what it does.  Not really reversible if you have to take the buckle apart with a screwdriver to reverse color."
3.0,These were OK at first for the pool but tore up very quickly.
3.0,"I have owned other base layers from Minus33 like the 230 gsm mid-weight Chocorua and was hoping the fit, especially the sleeve length, would be at least like that (noting that the sleeve length even on the Chocorua was just barely enough but I was able to give it a rinse and stretch out the arms a bit to make them cozy long).<br /><br />But the sleeves on this Yukon are like a good 3 inches shorter, so it just looks funny like it’s made for a T. Rex. My shirt sleeve size is 35 and I am skinny, so I had to get the Small size in this Yukon base layer that fits my torso fine, but it’s at best like a 32 sleeve size.<br /><br />The material itself is very soft and feels heavy like the 400 gsm the Yukon advertises, so the three stars in my rating are for the material quality. If you are short and stubby, this base layer will probably work well for you (but you probably don’t need the 400 gsm of wool weight as you probably don’t get that cold in the first place like skinny folks do)."
3.0,"I ordered these clog-style shoes to use as indoor slippers, but they were so roomy they wouldn’t stay on.  Important to know that these are not American sizes, so be prepared to go through some trial-and-error in choosing size.  I might have reordered in a different size, as I had bought a pair of these elastic-mesh shoes previously & really liked them.  But these were just waaay too wide.  Sent them back.<br />,"
3.0,"Didn't shed for me like some other reviews stated, I followed directions as shook it a few times and blow dried it and left it hanging and it fluffed up some, but it was overall thinner then I expected. Other reviews said it was thin but I didn't expect it to be this thin... as you can see in my pic I have it hanging on a hanger and you can see the light through both sides of it. Besides being thin it's cute and well stitched I don't expect it to fall apart"
3.0,"I have a Casio Pathfinder watch so I searched for a replacement band specifically for this watch. The band listed above was the recommended replacement. I liked the fact that it was black resin because I have another Casio with this type of band and it is very comfortable and sturdy. Now the reason for a three star rating : This band is NOT made for this watch. As another reviewer wrote it had to be modified to fit. Removing the old band and attaching the new band is a chore (not the fault of Amazon). You will need two jeweler type screwdrivers,using both at the same time, one to hold one screw which is stationary (it is permanently attached to the bar) and one to hold the other screw. You will really have to work at it because it is tight You will also have to figure out which screw is  attached to the bar.  By keeping the removable screw stationary with one screwdriver you turn the other screw to back out the bar from the band  I used a vice to hold the watch securely.Going to a jeweler is another option but considering that the band has to be modified at each end, the jeweler may not want to do it. I used a sharp knife to shave each end to make it fit. The band is also a little narrower than the old one so after I finally reattached the new band , the screws which were flush with the old band, protrude just a tad bit.<br />Casio bands are not ""generic"" so I don't believe an aftermarket band would work. I am sure that Casio makes a replacement band for this watch but this is not the one.  After all the work to remove,modify and replace, the end result looks good. New hardware is not supplied with the band so be patient and be careful because these parts are tiny so if you drop one it could disappear into never never land. Good Luck !!!<br />Update 07/30/13...Although I am still not happy that I had to modify the band to fit my Casio Pathfinder, I find myself liking the band more and more. The mods I have made are not visible to anyone but myself and it will most likely last a long ,long time."
3.0,color of peach and gray is a bright orange....not at all like the picture....disappointing
3.0,Smaller and taller than expected
3.0,"At the end of the manufacturing line this particular shirt should have ended up in a pile of factory seconds. On the inside of the shirt there was a long string of the material used as reinforcing at the neck. One end of that string was sewn into the neck and the other end was sewn into the bottom hem. I got tangled in it when I first tried to put the shirt on. I cut it off. In one armpit there is a snarled mess of the thread used to sew the panels together. I teased that clump loose enough to find the loop, cut the loop in the middle and tied the ends together. Don't know how long this shirt will stay in one piece. As I said, it's definitely a factory second. Too bad I paid full price. On the bright side, before ordering, I went to the Russell website to consult the sizing chart. My dimensions are at the very upper end of the range for size medium so I picked medium and it fits quite well."
3.0,Used product for daily walk routine for fitness. But the material made me sweat way TOO much! They were soaked with sweat after just 5 min of walking. Also just sitting outside on a hot day - very sweat making material!!
3.0,Socks were not as warm as I had hoped
3.0,Quality is nice but sized too small
3.0,A bit small in the waist. I typically wear a large but wanted a XL just to be safe and it was a bit snug
3.0,kind of loose but very cute
3.0,"Love it just bought a size to big, and now i can't wear it 🙃 hoping to exchange for smaller size, if I can exchange it this gets 5 star for helping with my mistake. If not I'll be back to rewrite my review."
3.0,Decided to return this because the stripes didn't look that good on me and also the bottom was a bit too long. It just wasn't for me. I did not feel it was very flattering. The fabric feels like silky spandex type of material.
3.0,I only received 1 butterfly and it came with 2 of one side of the antlers (no matter which way i turn them they're both going the same direction)
3.0,"They are not very comfortable compared to other brands. Where your foot touches the shoe, it's just flat and not contoured. Don't get me wrong, they are nice. Nice just doesn't equal comfort."
3.0,Nice loose top to wear around the house with leggings.
3.0,"The shoe is beautiful, but it doesn't feel like a size 8W.It's too narrow and my toes are all the way to the top."
3.0,kinda cheap but it works
3.0,Quality is good but the size is smaller than average
3.0,"Pros- cute sweatshirt, well made and really soft. Cons- runs small!! I’m 5’6” and 135lbs and normally wear a medium, however, I ordered a large because I like my sweatshirts to fit loose. It was still too small and pretty short in length. I ended up giving it to my 11 year old daughter who it fit perfect."
3.0,Gets holes fast from washing dishes
3.0,doesn't  fit the way it was described .
3.0,"It was to small, the leg holes were to tight.  There is no stretch in the stitching.  I think they make like elasticy thread, that would have been nice!"
3.0,Material feels cheap but OK. Love the colors and patterns. Does wick away moisture ok.
3.0,Uncomfortable after a few hours but very cute shoes. Toe opening is a tad too small though.
3.0,Beautiful but kind of flimsy.
3.0,"Fit large and details on the dress too large, finishing too in a haste, I couldn't use it for my 3yrs old daughter's birthday. Yet to wear it."
3.0,Clips for the shirt are great but the design to tighten at the bottom are not great . I'm using them for now but when I replace them I will not buy this brand again unless they update the design for length
3.0,The shirt is very cute in the picture and I read reviews that said it runs small so order up a size. Im always a small in shirts so I ordered a medium and it was huge. I feel like even if I ordered a small it would still be super wide.
3.0,Bought for a wedding and was hoping for a little bit longer as the dress rides up and has a deep slit in the back. The material is very stretchy and comfy- a little cheap feeling but not too bad. Size down- I am a size 4 and the small was a little small ( The dress is altered to fit tighter in the photos) Will probably not wear since its  bit short on me especially with heels. I am 5'8 for reference.
3.0,too small to wear.
3.0,"The headset works to make the environment quieter, however we've had them 5 weeks and the cover on the piece that goes over the head has torn. They have been used maybe all of 4 times."
3.0,"Very unflattering, too much space in the front portion not a good look."
3.0,Missing small strap
3.0,I’m 5’1 1/2 198bls<br />I ordered a extra large. It fits because the material is like spandex. Like I could workout in this dress and not worry about sweat. It was hugging my midsection more than I would like.
3.0,I read tons of reviews before I purchased these they feel great but the sizing is off I weigh 125 and ordered a small and they are to big and the length is way to long. And no booty lift for me 🤣..if your tall they be great
3.0,Shirt design looks fine but the color is clearly grey instead of white as shown in the picture
3.0,Birthday present for my boyfriend and it looks great.
3.0,Definitely not oversized. Not a favorite. A little disappointed.
3.0,"The waist is elastic, but I found it uncomfortably tight for wearing in the Florida heat. I ordered a small and I weight 107 lbs."
3.0,Description says slim. Tried it on and I looked like a hippo. No extra small option?
3.0,"This is fine. More like a nightgown material though. I am returning. It didn't look bad, but if you have curves this might not be the dress for you. Very short."
3.0,The size of the shirt is good. The fabric is thin but feels good the only complain i have about this shirt which is that the tint used to dye this shirt gets off on your skin and any other peice of clothin on top of it. Would not recommend this shirt and will not buy again.
3.0,"Nice quality, however I didn’t realize that I was only paying for 10 . I paid a dollar and some change for each strip. Sorry, I will not be ordering from here again. I meant to click on the one with 100 for less...sigh. It is good to pay attention."
3.0,"I gave this 3 because it arrived early and color and stitching is very nice however, the bulky shoulder pafs make me look very broad and I went 3 sizes up to XXL and it is still snug and tugs and clings to my hips that show the love handles still trapped there. The fit is odd and not flattering. Was excited to receive but will be sending back since I got it through prime."
3.0,"The pattern is cute but the cut of the bathing suit is kind of weird. It bunches in the butt area and looks like a diaper. The top was cute, on the smaller side."
3.0,"Lasted a while but lends pop out to easy, and randomly snapped in half..?"
3.0,"I work in a cold place and they help me a lot, it was not what I expected the price was good"
3.0,"Super cheap! You do get what you pay for, but it did work in a pinch!"
3.0,Cute pattern but the material is reminiscent of a bathing suit or costume. I will be returning this item because of the material.
3.0,You get what you pay for. It’s functional and looks ok but the color on the ends is chipping already.
3.0,My husband did not like these jeans fit him.<br />The sizing is off.  He typically wears a 32 or 33 with ease. The 34 is too tight and uncomfortable.<br />The back pocket stitching is well below the butt line and they ride low.<br />Sorry... Not the jeans for him.
3.0,Way too large. Ordered 0-3 and 18-24 and they were more like 6-9 and 4T.
3.0,Good fabric runs small
3.0,"I used to get these when they were around $20 and they were great, one of mine lasted for three years! But then they lowered the price and the quality and now I have to get a new one every season or so...I have already returned two to get new ones, fortunately they provide that service for free. It's a very fashionable watch so if you don't come in contact with water that often you should be okay. Great value for the price."
3.0,just okay the colors are NICE but the dress isn't as pictured (at least NOT the sleeves) I kinda like it but am leaning towards NOT liking it. I wish I did because it came on time and I  was excited about it... oh well cant win em all
3.0,In less than three months the white one has started falling apart at the seams and has a hole in it under the arm. I don't dry them so there's no reason for the fabric to be so weak.
3.0,"Fine pair of sunglasses while they lasted.  Unfortunately, the nose pads have both fallen off rendering them useless.  Not sure how you find 'spare parts'!"
3.0,"I got an extra larger that way it'd be a little big on me and I could wear it with leggings and it'd be a comfortable outfit, but the shirt is shorter than expected and a little more snug then I was hoping for. And the shirt has some high slits on the side that was not shown from the pictures displayed."
3.0,"I think this is a nice cover up, but it was too large in me. I am 5'3 and 132lbs."
3.0,It popped after 4 months.. but it’s comfortable.. it fits well..  but lasted only 4 months...
3.0,"These are super cute and material is stretchy but not in a see through kind of way good quality. They run very very small I’m usually an XS & read they run small so decided to go with a Small. They were still to little I can’t even wear them as underwear at home because they’re still too tight! I wanted tough fitting but a Medium would have fit better, meaning right size yet tight fitting how I wanted. Way too small."
3.0,"Belt missing. It was an &#34;out of the box&#34; fashion venture for me. Fits snug. Order at lest one size larger. If you are a L, or XL for sure.<br />Looks much better with a petticoat."
3.0,"Product fit well, but is more of a scoop neck...NOT a V neck"
3.0,"Overall, I found this dress too short and unflattering. I am 5'3&#34;, 135lbs, and a 34D. I ordered a medium hoping for a nice casual dress.<br /><br />While the dress was comfortable, looking in the mirror, I feel like I looked 5-10lbs heavier. The gen is also quite high and so could not bend over without accidentally flashing everyone!<br /><br />The dress quality is quite decent, especially for the price, but it did not look great on my body type."
3.0,Shirt is poor quality material and runs snug
3.0,Very short waisted Needs to come in tall
3.0,"When I ordered these, I wanted a true Navy color.  These were a lot lighter and I had to return them."
3.0,too small.....  lace on back didn't lay flat.  But the return process was easy and I'd order from them again.
3.0,A fun necklace to wear at work during Christmas time. When I opened the package one of the bulbs didn’t work. It was not a big deal because it wasn’t very noticeable during the day when I wore it.
3.0,"Pretty, good material, cup runs to small"
3.0,"Pants seem to be well made.  I ordered two pairs, one for me and one for my mom.  Unfortunately, neither pair fit.  They seem to run small."
3.0,I really love this coat but it is incredibly small. I knew it would probably be small coming from overseas so I ordered the 2x. I am 145 lbs 5'8 and this is a slim fit. The tops of the sleeves are tight. Very nice but I had hoped for a little wiggle room.
3.0,I like this dress. I needed it for a  special occasion  but it just isn't dressy enough. The material is cotton. Nice dress. That is why it only gets 3 stars.
3.0,Is not exactly how it looks in the picture
3.0,"A little to cheap for my wife.  Well, it was cheap."
3.0,It fits okay and has an adjustable pull cord on the back to hold it snug on your head. The big Drake Branding emblem on the forehead needs to go.
3.0,Love the bonnet!  But don't let the picture be deceiving.  Only one bonnet comes when you order from this site.
3.0,It’s ok I have no problem with it
3.0,"Looks exactly like the picture, but For some reason, the collar part is pretty large and so it looks kind of baggy"
3.0,They feel good against the skin and keeps the sweet down.Great product!
3.0,bought for my son and they dont fit his mouth. waste of money
3.0,"Looks great, fits comfortably, but straps frequently fall off."
3.0,"This hoodie is so comfy and plenty big and long for a tall, fat, busty girl like me. The only problem is that the sleeves are ridiculously baggy but the cuffs are normal so the sleeve part balloons out and looks frumpy and silly. Not really my style."
3.0,"Runs small. My son is 13 (5’9”)and can wear a youth xl. I had to return and get men’s medium, but it only just fits. Seems expensive for just a sweatshirt"
3.0,"I have a handful of piercings in both ears and decided to buy two sets of these. One set was fine, but I couldn't get the ball bearings to unscrew at all on either piece from the other set. (I had some friends, my brother, and even my mom give it a try too!) I'm disappointed because I really like the look of these, they're a good size (rod isn't too long) and are real surgical steel (I have terrible allergic reactions to cheaper metals). I ended up returning the set that wouldn't open."
3.0,"the front is weirdly longer than the back so you have to knot it. If you don't plan on doing that, don't get it"
3.0,Cute for a young girl.
3.0,The buckle broke after about a week of using it.
3.0,"Comes off if you sweat at all, sticky backing wears off quickly"
3.0,Don't like the material used to make this dress. The material kind of ruined the sexiness of it for me
3.0,Cute background but its just rayon and thin.
3.0,"Aun no me la he puesto hace como 4 meses atras la compre, el la manga queda un poquito mas anchita"
3.0,"Well I ordered the dark maroon burgundy color, and got more of a light pinkish purple color, not a color I would normally wear. Very strange. I also ordered the medium and it is pretty massive, I mean, I know it is supposed to be baggy and slouchy but... Very soft and comfortable though..."
3.0,"Kind of small, otherwise ok"
3.0,"Nice looking socks, but to small! Haventeven washed them yet! Scared it may shrink further and make them unusable! I have a size 9.5"
3.0,Some are cool some look kind of cheap. But I keep them as extras. It's good to have for backup
3.0,Very pretty camisoles. Only drawback to these is the lace trim at the hem is a bit too tight where all other areas of these tops fit nicely.
3.0,"Loved this dress but the fit didn't work for me, it might have been the light color (pink). Just looked a little tight around my stomach and butt, although it wasn't tight on me). Returned and looking for something else"
3.0,"Feels nice, very soft. But not a good fit for me. Feels and looks somewhat large. Would recommend if you are a smaller xl size tonorser a large."
3.0,"Only a small detail: the measurement to wear it as open shoulder blouse, doesn't fit, doesn't open wide.<br />Good material and color"
3.0,Very nice for a pool party!
3.0,"The material is cheap and thin. I ordered medium which is the size I wear in everything.  It felt tight on top. Perhaps if I went with a larger size it would flow better, but given the unsatisfactory fabric, I won't order a replacement."
3.0,Thought these were pretty online.  When they arrived they were cheap looking.  They are light and not very good quality.  Returned.
3.0,"I ordered according to the measurements instead of the size. They were nowhere close to the measurements. The large looked like it was for a child.<br />As for the pajamas themselves,  they are very smooth and silky, just order at least 2 sizes up."
3.0,"It is what it is. As a watch, it's not top of the line. As a toy, it's great.<br />This seller even installed the batteries. Nice touch."
3.0,Turtle broke off on the first wear
3.0,"I'm starting to get cataracts. I've been seeing halos around lights when driving at night. My eye doctor said my vision is pretty good, so cataract surgery is not necessary at this point. She recommended night vision glasses. I copped these, and they're very nice, with a case and a cleaning cloth. The glasses are well-made and comfortable to wear, but unfortunately, they didn't eliminate the halos to any great extent; they just turned them yellow. I'm not suggesting they won't work for someone else. We're all different."
3.0,"I will never buy a wallet again online. I'm too picky, and cheap. I mean, it's okay. I'm obviously not a huge fan of it though. The quality seems fine, but there's not a designated spot for a pen. Also, the pocket for coins is inside the wallet. Just several other functionality preferences that bug me. I didn't realize the metal parts were gold. I'm not a fan of that either. It's just me being picky. My previous wallet I had for about 8 years. I was pretty bummed that it was falling apart. My husband said that I really needed a new one, but I should've taken more time to pick one out. So if you're picky, like me, don't buy this wallet. If you're cheap, also like me, go looking for a wallet on clearance somewhere. Take your time to find the right one."
3.0,"This was a Christmas gift. The shirt was nice I just did not like that it came without a tag, it appears the tag was “ripped” or cut off because the tag threads are still on the shirt so it looks used."
3.0,Good size and nice product but VERY see through.
3.0,"I got the green one, its nice but I question the authenticity of the stones, the center stones look almost like acrylic or something and the base stone while it looks like quartz is dyed."
3.0,Cute dress but the fit is a bit large. I ordered a small and it fits more like a medium.
3.0,"It appears to be plastic, although I didn't take it to a jeweler to confirm.  The aqua color and shape of the flower is very nicely done, but it certainly doesn't appear to be simulated green coral, as described.  I wondered about that when I ordered because of the price.  Since the seller is ""Gem Stone King"" and it says ""Stone Creation Method, Natural"", I thought that it would be more than plastic.  Flowers are my favorite motif in jewelry and this is one of my favorite colors, so I might keep it, but not sure yet.  I just wanted anyone considering this to know what to expect."
3.0,Weak
3.0,"The set is very nice.  But, order two sizes larger."
3.0,"This is a nice looking item, but it is too big for me.  The description is a bit short and does not state the size of wrist it fits."
3.0,"Logo pieces keep the temples (ear stems) straight, but fall out all the time and are easily lost. Loved the glasses and fit before I lost the logos… pls fix and these will be a great value brand sun glass.<br /><br />Either make them stay in better or don’t have. If they’re meant to pop out for people with big heads, be up front and instruct to glue in or something…"
3.0,Two of the four I ordered have ripped
3.0,It’s an ok buy
3.0,"I love the bracelet, however, after only having it on for a few days the elastic began to fray and then within a week the elastic band broke completely. Now I just have a bunch of beads. Good product, just needs a more durable band."
3.0,This is a nice scarf but it's definitely not navy blue. It's closer to royal blue.
3.0,"This bra was a serious let down. Don't get me wrong the quality and comfort is fantastic, but the size chart made it very difficult to know what size I was ordering. I am a small busted gal, usually an A cup to Bcup, so I ordered what I thought was going to be a 34A. My measuments are 34&#34; cheast 24&#34; waist 38&#34; hip at 5'7&#34; tall and 125lbs. Instead after reading the package, I was sent a size 85 (there are no cup sizes listed on it) witch turned out to be for B to C cup. It's extremely flattering and fits in all the right places with no gaps, but I look like I'm back in middle school wearing double bras to look like I have a much bigger bust. In the photo the bra on top is one of my own (34A with padding) and you can see how much bigger the cups are on the AToo. I will be returning this one and sizing down to their size 80."
3.0,Fit too baggy shipping took forever Will not purchase this product again
3.0,i like the top portion but to put it on the right spot for bottom  portion its fall short.
3.0,"Watch arrived and does not work.  Waiting to hear from seller.<br /><br />Update:  Seller was courteous with my complaint and sent a new battery right away.  I had to replace it myself, but had the tools."
3.0,Kept twisting all night.  Lame
3.0,"This was such an adorable camisole and shorts set for sleep. But I am usually a size 6, sometimes a 4, and the size large was tiny on me. Too bad because I loved the look and feel of the set! The elastic waist on the shorts was extremely snug and the camisole was a bit on the short side. I don’t think an extra large would have solved the problem."
3.0,It’s ok. Cute but color is way off. Not near the picture. Much more orange
3.0,the coating on a couple of the gold teeth was incomplete but it overall fits with a costume type of item. Clasp for the necklace could be easily broken as well.
3.0,Love tbe earrings but kinda mad that I was able to get the same pair for half the price from China website. Maybe I got lucky with that because other items from that site are mostly junk.
3.0,I thought it looked a little poorly made...not well defined and it was larger than it appeared in the picture.  Did not look dainty at all but my granddaughter liked it so that made it OK.
3.0,Lens portion of frame is much smaller than depicted in picture.
3.0,"There is no &#34;rope&#34; used on this necklace.  It is the same inexpensive plastic string used in cheap leather and jewelry on today's market.  The feather has been pressed out of the host material but I found bits of it sticking out on the exterior side of the feather. I was 'very fortunate' when I used my fingernail to pop these off, because the residue bounced off my forehead and not into my eye....  Be careful---don't try this at home.  When you do it, wear protective eyewear---and glasses don't count!!!<br /><br />I expect the jewels to be dropping off real soon.  It looks like they are set in there kind of haphazardly and even the sizes are inconsistent."
3.0,To much small
3.0,They served the purpose
3.0,I love the shorts they are a little small but delivery time is very long.
3.0,They're soft and work perfectly except the heel keeps slipping off. That's a bit annoying.
3.0,"It fits well and came at a really great price. Unfortunately, it had a small flaw in the front chest area. It's minor, but is pretty obvious when looking straight on. I just wore a scarf with it and it covered up the minor flaw. The flaw was like a missed threading or loop in the knit. Again, this was really cheap, so I'm not complaining. I've worn it a bunch...just with a scarf."
3.0,No nose piece.
3.0,Expected something comfier from a hiking shoe company.
3.0,Nice wallet but packed very cheaply!
3.0,Now I know what iced out rhinestones mean!<br />- ___-  no actual rhinestones!
3.0,Sharp edges since there is no smooth finish on the plastic. A little sanding from the manufacturer could have made these a 5 star.
3.0,I need to return them as they are too big in length but very comfortable.
3.0,"So I went by the 17cm diameter measurement that was given, but what they failed to mention was that the bangle isn’t round, it’s an oval. So where the head of the nail is, actually digs into the top of my wrist (which as you can imagine is quite uncomfortable).<br /><br />Overall it’s a gorgeous bangle (if it fits you). I had to regift it, but I’d be willing to try again if they’d offer a larger size."
3.0,Was too big on me. Liked the design but it was huge
3.0,"Nice looking,  but way too small for an adult wrist. It was right on my 13 year old daughter as well."
3.0,"Very cute dress for the price, but the fabric is super itchy! This dress has no lining. And, the hem was horribly uneven! Took it to my seamstress to even out, but it may end up being too short once it's fixed. Oh, well...still a cute dress though."
3.0,"Bought as a gift for my granddaughter. The sleeves were too short. The bust cups were too high to fit her properly. Will be returning. The color was great, but to order another size would not correct the fit for her."
3.0,Nice blouse but way too large.
3.0,really love this and it looks nice but it's not very sturdy; the leather tears pretty quickly from removing cards.
3.0,But it's also a little slow on the time.
3.0,My daughter loves the slipper. The delivery time was extremely long. It took weeks.
3.0,"While this is very roomy (bought as a gift for a 6ft 2in, 350lb man and it's plenty big) the poncho style coupled with a very small head opening and attached hood makes it constricting around the neck. If you don't like the way turtlenecks feel you won't enjoy this. A different neckline and an option to detach the hood would make this a 5 star product."
3.0,This is a good dinner jacket. However it is not the correct white. It should be an off white ivory. This is like toothpaste white. But you can’t beat the price. Good quality.
3.0,Overall it’s a cute necklace but it doesn’t look like  genuine Turquoise. (I’m not saying it isn’t genuine but it just doesn’t have that rich color I’m used to seeing)
3.0,body broke off of the head on one of them.  not really sure how it happened.  i was not with my 8 year old granddaughter when it happened.
3.0,"So cute, but huge!!!"
3.0,Cute dress but I think the material is too thin and see through for my liking.
3.0,Top was too large around rib cage and cups were a little tinny on me and bottom was too small. I ordered a small and I'm usually a small. Top was more like a medium and bottom more like xs mall. Padding in top a little awkward because cup size was too small on me. Padding is not removable. If you are broad on top and have a small cup size and no hips this will work perfectly. If you're taller than 5'10&#34; then this will also probably work and order true to size. I'm only 5'2&#34; and my rib cage is not that wide.
3.0,This  jacket was loved by my daughter at first sight but then the zipper broke and we couldn't fix it. There really is no point in a jacket anymore if you can't zip it to stay warm. And the quality is not great overall. Super cute though with the multi-color faux fur on the hood and the sizing is on point. I am returning this although my daughter really liked it at first.
3.0,So I ordered a medium which fits perfectly per the measurements except the patterned one I ordered is the correct length. The wine and black ones are about 2 inches longer than the description so I’m going to have to pay for alteration. So disappointing cause I love the material and the fit otherwise
3.0,Too wide at the crop end. Was hoping for a slim fit. Making it work though.
3.0,"The colors of this pj are spot on but the fit is rather unflattering. I am 5ft 9 weigh 212lbs and I ordered an XL, I definitely could've sized down to a L, the pant waist is waaaaaay to big but I can still wear them.  The material feels like cotton, it doesnt shrink after washing, I decided to keep them, they are comfy."
3.0,Nice length but setting keeps turning over to the back.
3.0,"Look really cute, easy to mold to shape, lights are bright and delightful to look at, but flowers fall off very easily. good value for money though when ordered in large pack. gave as bridesmaids gifts for wedding and were fun at the reception dance party."
3.0,Pretty small. You can only put tiny glasses in it.
3.0,The product looks much better on the picture.
3.0,They work for their intent however the metal pieces tend to break or bend at some point. This was my second purchase and same thing happened so i tried the thigh ones. i figured it was the motions i would make that would cause them to break. If you don't move to actively then they should be fine.
3.0,"Loved this dress, it was super cute but the spaghetti straps were soooo thin they didn't even make it through one wash in the washing machine before breaking :-(  Now it can only be an ""at home dress"" as I had to sew it back together and doesn't look nice enough to go out.<br />I purchased this in the black, which was a nice cotton-y material and the pink which was much higher % polyester material. I sent the pink one back immediately, too hot a material for summer. I was looking forward to wearing the black one. It is still cute but like I said it is now just a house dress.<br />If you buy it, either hand wash it or wash it in a lingerie bag or the straps will break too easily in an automatic washer."
3.0,"I wore these flip flops to a concert where I stood the length of concert, long story short, the pain began to hurt so bad, I had to remove them and leave barefoot, not safe! I recommend wearing short periods of time"
3.0,"Cute and a good quality, but the hair tie is difficult to remove."
3.0,"Really great concept, however we had a very difficult time getting them to snap on and then once we did, there was no way they are coming off.  I've ruined my fingernails trying to get some off.  We wanted to reposition a pair and it was impossible to remove so they just had to stay in the original position. My word of advice...make sure you know the exact placement and spacing you want before you securely attach them to the pants."
3.0,Love the look of these but the posts are really thick and won't go in my ears!
3.0,This mask was too flimsy for me to use. Every breath I took would make the mask come in yo my face.
3.0,"its cute but I think mines broke lol, I have yet to figure out how to wear it but its here we shall see..."
3.0,Liked the purple color but to small even though I bought the size I would normally buy.
3.0,"Pretty but definitely BLUE not green. Smaller than I expected, but pretty and dainty."
3.0,"Did not fit the buckle and it claims to be the same size. It was a substitution for my husband's belt but it was a waist of money, i had to buy one with the buckle"
3.0,Nice looking backpack but one of the straps broke.
3.0,"It's cute, the style and the print. But the fabric is bad quality,<br />doesn't feel good on my skin. Not for wear in summer,<br />because is hot."
3.0,"unfortunately, I need a higher waist, as I am always pulling up the waist during yoga"
3.0,They are cute but I have small wrists so I like the bracelets that wrap it squeeze closed. These looked like they would squeeze closed but they do not. Otherwise cute but more like a bangle bracelet and too big for me.
3.0,Fits fine but the one I received was made from a scratchy material. Many of the reviews I read commented on how soft it was. Seems like the manufacturer may not be consistent in their materials.
3.0,To Small. Not a big deal. under Armour is a gamble on sizing!
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress but the straps got tangled and it took me forever to get untangled. Once I did, they were stretched out and the dress didn't fit well on top."
3.0,"Good belt, but make sure all the rivets are bolted into place."
3.0,"Too short.  I’m 5’7”, and it didn’t come close to the floor.  Even with flat sandals, it would look silly. The green color was beautiful, and the dress has some weight to it, if that’s what you’re looking for."
3.0,"Overall I think that they will be fine, just received them and haven't the opportunity to use them because they are too long,  I am 5'11"" and i will probably have to put about a 2"" hem in them for them to work as designed.  But the clasp seem solid and elastic seems to be a heavy duty type so that is good.  The ones I use in the military wore out usually quick within about 2 months.  Theses look like they will last a real long time"
3.0,I love the shape of these mask but they do a shrink a bit. They don't my small face nicely before washing but after washing they are too small. I rewashed and tired to stretch as they dried and I can wear them but they are barely coving my nose and chin. If I talk they come off my chin. The cotton is more like need sheet cotton. Not soft at all. Over all I got what I paid for.<br /><br />If you have an average face size or are male these w won't work for you.
3.0,I had to leave town and am currently in Dallas Tx  Can't wait to get home to try the dress on
3.0,Pretty small. Definitely smaller than expected.
3.0,Its like im wrestling with these socks daily.. Very hard to pull overnight Im cafe good
3.0,"Ordered this for my 5 year old. The gloves fit perfectly, but the hat is tiny! The hat just barely fits my 2 year old daughter! Certainly not the right size for my 5 year old."
3.0,"The coat is cool but you should size down. Also, if you are expecting purple, stop. It's pink"
3.0,These look nice but they are gold not rose gold
3.0,I didnt like the style
3.0,"In general these sandals are ok, I got them in tan color. they look a bit cheaper then on the picture, at least the sole of it, liked the upper decor though. what I don't like about them and didn't see it on the picture is that the bottom of the shoe ... curls up both sides! so you literally have to press the sole by your feet! and my guess it is not because of the delivery failure, it's the way this sandal is made! I didn't return them since I figured it would've been too much hassle for me, so I'm keeping them, but definitely wouldn't recommend to buy them!maybe there is no such problem with other colors"
3.0,"Fits good.  Is not undetectable, though, as stated.  So I use it as a carry pouch on the outside of my clothes when I can't carry a purse."
3.0,Very stiff so hard to get into.
3.0,"Cheaply made, size was way too small."
3.0,cut small
3.0,"Cheap shirt that I didn’t expect to be well made, so it it fit my expectations. The only thing that was ill fitting was the shoulder area. The way the sleeves are cut makes those little strips fit weird and fall weird right on the shoulders. Other then that it’s ok and a decent plus size shirt. Just be prepared to cut little strings hanging off it😁"
3.0,Order a larger size otherwise is a nice garment.
3.0,"Nice set, understated and demure.  Not in you face sparkle, but a nice amount.  Earrings are fairly small, but they shine nicely and the necklace has a nice length to it, for me at least, it hangs right where I would want it to."
3.0,It's okay haven't worn it out. Just tried it on. Material is average nothing special.
3.0,"These pants are awesome in a lot of ways except for one, they get very loose very quickly and then you are constantly pulling them back up. Color is great, sizing is great, length is great, opacity is great, price is great, but the elasticity does not snap back."
3.0,The colors fell a little flat but the keychain has a weird shine to it. I bought this for a concert bag so I don’t really mind. It looks good from far away but upon closer inspection is where you can see where it falls short.
3.0,"This clutch is very cute, and I get a lot of compliments on it. The only issue is I can't fit more than my phone keys and a lip gloss. If you're looking for something bigger this is not the clutch but it is a cute accessory"
3.0,Was fun to use with a Halloween costume.
3.0,My son wears a size 12/14 but this ran extremely small I wouldn’t recommend buying this if your kids a husky.
3.0,"While I love the design of this shirt, I should have listened to the other reviewers.  I hover between a small and medium size at the moment, so when I read other reviewers say to buy a size up, I assumed the medium should be sufficient.  It is not.  It barely fits.  The biggest problem I have with it though is the length.  It is just so much shorter than I expected.  The fit would be less concerning if there was more length.<br /><br />Also, like other reviewers have mentioned, the material feels a little subpar, both in the collar and the shirt.  The collar is a stiff, rough material, while the shirt is a very thin, satin polyester.  Neither feel quality-made.  It is disappointing, as I really love the design and print of this shirt."
3.0,Material is decent quality however it is a bit shorter than I expected and somewhat snug. I plan to keep it but will need to find the right top to pair it with.
3.0,I like the convenience of having glasses handy on your cell phone.<br />I didn't like is that they either come scratched or got scratched very quikly so now my vision is impaired by the scratches that I cannot get out....
3.0,"They don't work well for any fake piercing accept for the lobe. They squeeze quite hard, so you can't wear them too long before they feel like your ears are falling off. They also keep your ears red for awhile after you take them off"
3.0,My boyfriend is pretty slim.  Normally wears a 32 x 31. We had to buy him the Large (42-44).
3.0,The belt hole have a slit behind the hole. Partner wore it for a week and the belt hole had slid through the slit.  I did not read anywhere that this was supposed to happen. I've never seen a belt hole with this sort of design. Thank you
3.0,"I didnt like the look of it for wearing so I just use it as a head scarf when I sleep....might not buy again, It was very thinn"
3.0,Looks well made. Loved it at first. Got little balls all over it first time in laundry.
3.0,went 1 size larger still snug
3.0,"So far, the only reply I can contest to is looks & weight  of said sandal."
3.0,I like the clasp as it holds my sweaters closed!  It works!
3.0,Too heavy but sturdy
3.0,"unnatural look for me, so I gave it away."
3.0,It fits good. Had to buy larger like suggested. It is super thin! Like sheer and almost see through. Not what we thought we were getting.
3.0,Not 100 percent cashmere...feels more like wool to me.
3.0,"Did not fit,"
3.0,"This skirt is very nice but it is not true to size, I recommend getting a size larger."
3.0,I would rate better but the stitching starting unraveling after a months use.
3.0,The stone itself was ok but the necklace that it comes with isn't worth the postage they used to mail it.
3.0,"Too large in the top and not long enough, not a good fit for someone tall and slender."
3.0,very cute outfit however you would need to order a size bigger
3.0,"Expe ted to get a dark green tee and instead got a feathered. Gre  )white flecks).  I don't hate the color but it is different from.what I see.on the site.  Would love the same thing two inches longer, with stiffer cotton material, and with slightly more generous sleeves.  The length of the sleeves is great - goes to my elbows. That is hard.to fine."
3.0,Looks nice though..
3.0,I really like the look and make of this shoe my problem is that the heel is a little wobbly. It's a bit strange because I have bought Qupid shoes and never had this kind of problem. I am thinking of sending it back.
3.0,these were lovely gloves but seemed to run pretty small.
3.0,These pants were not even the length I ordered.
3.0,Love the look of the shoe but tight around the big toe area hence it either needs to be worn more/often so it can stretch so it can stop squeezing my big toe. However it does fit to size and I wear  size 6.
3.0,"This card case is indeed leather. The cloth backing is softer than in all of my many other cases. Also the cloth backing in not glued to the leather as it is in all of my other card cases. I think this may cause it to tear easier and faster than desired and  that this would cause it to fall apart faster, but will not know until it passes or fails the TIME TEST. It is sewn and glued which is good. One section is only SOFT CLOTH---no leather at all. This lessens its durability. I would say its better than the CHINESE versions out there and about equal to the $8-12 INDIAN ones out there. THIS in NO WAY COMPARES to a $30-50 card case."
3.0,Got an XL and it still fight kind of tight around the arms.  Super cute and warm!
3.0,"Really really long, though should not be"
3.0,Disappointed because I like my socks soft and on the thick side. These are thick but not soft.
3.0,A little tight and snug it’s the material I sent it back for an aline fit
3.0,"They do not work with the wallet I needed it for, but, I can use it with my other wallets."
3.0,These skirts are somewhat small -- and do not have sequins on them as described.  However the design is attractive and they are very comfortable in the summer and the price is excellent.
3.0,One of them came broken from the get go. Not worth having to send it back just for a few bucks back. So I thought I could just use the non broken for my tragus but it’s a bit large and awkward for that part of my ear. Would’ve been pretty and a good size for my second lobe holes.
3.0,"I expected more quality in the prints, they look cheap."
3.0,I’m giving the bracelet a 3 because of size. I have a small wrist. Wear probably a 6 but this only fit by using the added chain link. It didn’t look good that way.<br />The bracelet itself is beautiful. Very nice quality.
3.0,The color of the metal in the product picture is soft white and the item I received looked a bit yellow-ish.  The faux jewels also looked more blue. Some of the tips and edges of the metal part are not smooth. I’ve been afraid to use it high quality silk scarves.
3.0,Runs small. Had to reorder
3.0,Does not stay in place while wearing.  Very pretty piece.
3.0,"Fits strangely.  The cups are cheap and there are gaps in the front.  Tried to adjust straps and back, but not great."
3.0,Not true to size and the plate between the breast is funky/shriveled
3.0,These earrings look just like some that I purchase in white gold.  I should have listened to the other reviewer about them catching on clothes.  I like to wear earrings all the time and these are scratchy and sharp.  The hinge is also very stiff.  I think they could be better with more finishing.  I think they could be fixed by someone who has the right equipment for sanding stainless steel.  I really wanted these to work.  I am going to give them away.
3.0,I liked the shape and fit of this item.  But the white was an off-gray color!  Very disappointed and sent it back!
3.0,I have a big chest 36DDD and a tiny waist typically a size 2. So I ordered a small. To my surprise it was large and loose on the top and tight at the stomach waste. Not comfortable and not cute. Returning.
3.0,Covered my whole face
3.0,"Cute & sexy turtleneck but it was way too snug.  If you are a fuller breasted woman, go a size up"
3.0,comfortable but very light
3.0,Great costume just gave less stars because had to return and buy again to get right size. Runs small. So now payed for two costumes waiting for later one and waiting on refund of the smaller one. But costume us great
3.0,"Not sure if I got a knockoff, but I'm not thrilled with this mask.<br />Pros: provides structure, doesn't hamper breathing, can drop my jaw unlike other masks.<br />Cons: thick synthetic material (was hoping it would be more breathable). size is absolutely huge for me - I am a petite adult - and it swallows my face, causing wrinkles in the mask and bunching around my neck under my jaw. I find myself continually adjusting it because it's so big. finally, given that it's not snug around parts of the edges, it doesn't feel like it's actually stopping COVID."
3.0,Good size as I like larger sunglasses. I do wish the lenses were darker. Living in Florida the sun is very harsh and I prefer darker lenses.
3.0,It looks pretty cheep. You get what you pay for.
3.0,I like the material but it was a little small.
3.0,If you have small boobs it will work but it’s just not giving
3.0,Socks slide down in ducks boots
3.0,It's cute but runs small. I typically wear a size 2 and the 4 was way too tight.
3.0,I was a little surprised by the fabric.  It doesn't seem very breathable. It is a thinner fabric.  It's a stretchy material.  It's a cute little outfit Love the strawberries.  The fit is fine and as expected.  I just thought the material would be softer cotton.  The colors are bold and bright.  I do like this outfit a lot.
3.0,"There was nothing wrong with it, and a good value. I added a red and black stripped vest (from the Dollar Store) to complete the look. The 4 year old loved the vest most of all. I like that the hat is a flat felt hat. It folds completely flat and simply has a hole in the middle to fit head into )more like a crown vs. a hat. I would give it 4 starts if it hat a vest with it."
3.0,"These look ok but pull on your nose at first then later will not stay on your nose - kind of irritating in the fact they constantly have to be pulled up, wouldn’t buy again"
3.0,Not really to my liking looks more like a witch costume
3.0,I was not disappointed for the price I paid.<br />With that said in the future I will pay the premium price and buy the Oakley lenses.  I have tried just about every brand of Oakley Flak Jacket 3rd party lenses and although most of them are fair they do not compare to the Oakley lenses.  I will say that these look good and fit perfect.
3.0,This is very cute but it does not breath.  I bought for a carribean cruise and was so hot in it.
3.0,"it was ok, the headband that came with it was awful all bent out of shapped and the string of beads that was glued to it was all crooked and out of place. I couldnt wear the head band it was that bad looking."
3.0,These clip-ons will be fine for night driving.  I took them to my optometrist to test them.  They are not polarized.  The claim is false.  I'll use them for night driving only.
3.0,Really cute but runs extremely big I had to send it back
3.0,"I like the product, I'm a petite woman so when I was expecting a small, I was expexted a more fit to the body, so for the petite women out there get a xs for that tight fit"
3.0,"It's a little tighter than I was expecting, but it still worked.  My biggest complaint is the color...my shirt color looks nothing like the picture."
3.0,"It is pink NOT red, but I like the fitting just not happy with the color."
3.0,"I bought these for a masquerade birthday party. They were absolutely gorgeous and very dainty. These are not plastic, they are like a thick lace/cloth material. Unfortunately the ribbon that ties at the back of your head broke right off of two different masks. Luckily, the birthday girl and other guests were cool about it and we made it by with scotch tape."
3.0,"Didn’t like the fabric,  it was sheer but kinda scratchy."
3.0,These are exactly what I needed so that my wife can extend some of her necklaces.<br />She likes that there is a variety of both gold and silver and different sizes. However I am disappointed due to the fact that we received (2) four inch extensions in the silver and not a 6 inch extension in the silver. These 6 inch extension in silver was the main one that we wanted that is why we gave a three-star instead of 5 star due to not receiving the correct sizes as advertised.
3.0,"Very nice dress, lightweight and true to sizing chart. I’m only giving it a 4 because of the quality and packaging. There were several strings fraying, that may cause issues with the dress unraveling. Other than that, I wore it and received a lot of compliments! I’d recommend"
3.0,Top bit of the shirt was cute. The pocket decal is placed well. The bottom of the shirt is weird. It's gathered with stiff elastic and pokes out funny. Made it work by tucking it into a high waisted black skirt but I can't wear it with jeans/shorts.
3.0,It looks like it has e been used for years after 1 or 2 uses.
3.0,It's a great belt but after wearing it for a while the back seems to be losing its grip and slips and the buckle comes loose. It was great for the first few months of use.
3.0,They were just as pictured but they really do pinch. Can't wear them for more than a couple of hours or they really dig into you  almost breaking the surface of the skin.
3.0,"Why I bought it:<br />- I was looking for a home wear shorts and top set<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />- Top is way too thin and body fit<br />- There aren't any pants as mentioned in the title, just a pair of shorts<br />- Fabric is see through<br />- Top doesn't provide any warmth but shorts do<br />- Fitting is tight or else the size chart is incorrect<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />- Light weight and easy to put on<br />- Shorts are good and pattern is cute<br />- Waist band is thick and ribbon is cool but thin<br /><br />Will I recommend it:<br />- I bought it because it was on sale and cost about 10 bucks, but if I had to pay a penny more I would have returned it"
3.0,"I cannot get over the washing instructions inside these pants, which say: Washing With Hand, Dry Clean Only, Do Not Machine Wash, Do No Bleach, Steam Pressing, Do Not Tumble Dry, Flat Dry. That's exactly what it says, and this on a 100% cotton garment. I see at least one reviewer who washes them in a machine, as I will.<br />As for the pants, they seem to fit true to size, have six decent pockets, the back right one has a button, and the cargo pockets have two high quality snaps each. I guess the description as casual work cargo twill pants is accurate, as long as you don't work in an office. These are very casual cargo pants, twill instead of typical sweat pant material. Twill sweat pants, with cargo pockets.<br />I will plan on revisiting this review to detail washing experience and how they wear.<br />BTW, I paid list price for these, a reasonable list price, but they were not provided to me for  review.<br />Edit, 12/7/2016: Washed these today, gentle cycle, air-dried them for about half an hour, then into a medium heat dryer for less than 20 minutes. They look fine and I will do that in the future. This would raise my star rating to at least four stars. They are a nice, inexpensive cargo sweat pant, just  more like a cotton pant than a traditional sweat pant. Now I would like to see another color option or two."
3.0,I loved it. The color was beautiful. It was too tight on my wrist to wear comfortably so I gave it away though. I’m 5’9” and 155 so not that large.
3.0,"Pendent is pretty, but the chain is too delicate."
3.0,"This skirt is worth $5. Material is very thin and inexpensive. The finish work on the hem is not quality. If you just want 'the look' it will be fine, but I would not wear this for a nice occasion. You could buy this as part of a costume in the dollar store. If you want quality look at Belle Poque or Scarlet Darkness, but you will have to put out a few more dollars for quality!"
3.0,A little tight and thinner material than I expected.  Probably will be returning
3.0,Item looked better on image. Reflective rim was nice however the umbrella itself was not strong enough for winds.  I also found the handle small...not the best comfort for holding.
3.0,I not too happy about this item because swing with a light frizz I had to put a rope on the corner don't blow away.
3.0,"Beautiful ring. The setting sits really low. On complaint I have otherwise, it's a great ring."
3.0,"the ""free gift"" never came in and the necklace looks fine except for a weird metallic dent on the bottom, as seen in the third picture"
3.0,"These are not 16g, their all 14g. Their cute as heck but I definitely had to painfully stretch my piercing to fit them. I’ve had my piercing for years and have always stuck with 16g cus I preferred the smaller size but if your a 16g buying these be prepared to be sore if you use them. Very cute tho"
3.0,Much shorter than size 4
3.0,This belt was pretty tight. Don't get me wrong it is very cute! Just small an tight I couldn't really wear it.
3.0,Love the color and softness. For me the arms were too long and tight at hips. Pockets need attached better to the inside of shirt. They continually pop out.
3.0,"The stone looks authentic, but it's much smaller than I had anticipated."
3.0,"Meh...I think these are for children, very cute no nose wire definitely not for adults"
3.0,I thought these were a wire outline.  They are actually white!!!!  i have not worn them yet . . .
3.0,See thru. Have to wear a bra.
3.0,"I think it is very cute, and I still wear it, but it does fit loose.  My watch tends to slide around."
3.0,"I live in Southern California where it's mostly warm and walk a minimum of two miles every day. I'm always looking for comfortable shorts that fit wel - not too tight and not so loose they're in danger of falling down (!)..<br /><br />These My Kilometre shorts meet my demands. They fit well and are very comfortable. The design is classy - noticable without being brash (not that I care).<br /><br />There are two issues:<br />1. The fabric is stiff and shiny, similar to a windbreaker. Not really a good feel on the skin. Plus they make an irritating shusing sound when you walk.<br />2. There are small pockets inside the regular pockets. The regular pockets are too big and the inside pocket is too small. I always carry my cell phone and it flops around in the regular pocket but won't fit in the inner pocket so both pockets are worthless for me.<br /><br />The search for the perfect walking shorts continues..."
3.0,"gown came very quickly and the seller responded to inquiries quickly as well. The dress is well made and beautiful. The color was true to the photo on the product page. It's indeed very flowy! I don't see why I included my measurements because the dress was 6 inches too long for me! Due to the layers of the gown, it was going to cost over $100 to have it hemmed so I had to do a simple stitch and tuck a bunch of it under the waistband. I spent the entire wedding trying not to trip over my dress. Even though I provided my measurements, the torso part was made for someone with an extra 2 inches of height, so there were all these awkward saggy parts (even though I wear a size D bra). The gown ended up looking ok for the wedding I was in, but it wasn't super complimenting of my shape because it was miles too large."
3.0,These are comfortable socks which are well made.  They were just a little snug on me but I still wear them and will get lots of wear from them.
3.0,Love the design.  But it came broken. My husband attached it together. The other reviews stated they had problems also.  I think the company needs to inspect product. It came in a sealed velvet pouch. The covers are adorable. Love the concept
3.0,Doesnt show the design well when wearing it...it also is super tight around the mouth so I'm constantly pulling it out so I can talk..but I'm going to use it as a small pillow case or flag on the wall but not to good for a facemask and I'm upset about that cuz I need a really good one to 1 up the guys at work...so still on the hunt
3.0,"LOVE the purse its beautiful, however inside bag zipper is broken and i have not been able to find how to contact the seller."
3.0,More of a costume skirt rather than a nice tulle skirt. I ended up wearing it for Halloween which is not what I intended it for
3.0,There were faint white lines running down the seams. It also hit at a really unflattering angle at the waist.<br /><br />It is a true tight bandage dress with thick material. It just wasn't for me.
3.0,I got the white with green lenses.<br /><br />Good:  The hinges flex like real glasses.  Fairly inexpensive.<br /><br />Bad:  White paint came chipped away and peels.  The lenses are easily scratched and speckled (if that makes sense).<br /><br />Overall:  Decent enough for fun or driving.
3.0,"The picture makes the product look absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately the color did not quite have the ring to it for my liking and there were more stems brought to the front than flowers. Nevertheless, it is still nice and has a unique color."
3.0,"The concept is perfect, and they worked well...until they broke. Both of my daughters had theirs break. Customer service was excellent and replaced them...and then they broke again. All four of them! The red tip doesn't want to stay on at all, so if they lasted longer than a month, these would be perfect!"
3.0,"They're nice, everything about them is great except the balls. Which them and the stones are very tiny, so you don't really even see sapphire stones. Basically, pretty purposeless."
3.0,I’m 5’3 147lbs. I ordered this in black size s just like the brown and the brown feels like it’s a whole size smaller on the top. The sleeves are really short but the pants have a decent length to them. If you don’t mind keeping your sleeves rolled up I’d say go for it because it is SUPER cute and comfortable<br /><br />EDIT: I also ordered the light green in a small and it fits good like the black. Maybe it’s just the brown that’s weird fitting. I’d rate the black and green 5 stars and the brown one 2 stars.
3.0,"Was sent the wrong size, was a half size to small, but my son really needed shoes so they will have to work if only for a short time."
3.0,I used this goggles for twice then it doesn't fit and also difficult to adjust
3.0,doesn't really help children tell time... they need regular watches....but it's cute
3.0,These briefs are comfortable but at only 10% spandex type material and 90% polyester not much compression<br />Have bought similar briefs at Ross’ discount for cheaper. Mesh fly is nice though
3.0,"One thing to keep in mind when purchasing any new jewellery is that everyone's piercings are different and earrings that fit nicely for one person won't necessarily work for another.<br />They definitely do look wonderful, but my daith piercings are set quite far back and it doesn't allow the ring to rest inside my ear fully, so I'm not sure if they'll work long term for me.<br />I would not recommend these earrings for a daith piercing, but i cannot say whether it would be good or bad for people whose daith piercings are a bit more shallow or for other piercings."
3.0,Fit all wrong will re-gift not true to size
3.0,Fit is kinda large and fabric quality is not as nice as some of the other brands I have.
3.0,Thin material!
3.0,"Would like to send them back, but I can give to granddaughter."
3.0,The earrings were pretty but disappointed on the size
3.0,"Packaging was not adequate. Opened and found one lense had popped out. Was able to snap it back in with no scratches so didn't return them. Otherwise, fit is good."
3.0,Didn’t like the material I thought it was gonna be a little dresser!
3.0,Nice fit except breast area is small barely covers me. Other than that I can't wait to wear this outfit to my upcoming concert
3.0,these were all right but the knitting wasn't super great quality. My biggest problem was that the coloring was quite off from the picture. The colors where much darker and deeper than I had thought. It wouldnt be a huge deal but I bought them for my sister as a present and was looking for very specific shades matching her favorite colors. overall for the price they were alright.
3.0,"The colors did not look tje same on the actual top when I received it. The material also wasn't as I expected, it just didn't feel right on my skin."
3.0,"Runs small, but cute"
3.0,"They are cute and a good size for charm bracelets or earrings, however I couldn't use about 6 of them b/c the wings were 2 different heights."
3.0,Material was not  as soft as other purchases. Design was just alright thought night shirt had pockets.
3.0,Pretty dress and design but beware of gapping in the chest or stomach if you are busty or have anything other than an hourglass tummy shape. Would benefit to order up a size.
3.0,"Its a touch large. I mean just a little bit. The thing I don't like is the smell. It smelled like the plastic bag it came in. Weird. After washing it was a little fitter, not much and the smell kind of lingered."
3.0,No pockets and small in size.
3.0,"The stone is set in a silver twist of wire, very nice.  The stone, for its desired abilities was crude.  Should have been polished to a gloss to extract its properties.  The stone should be refined."
3.0,No bells and whistles.  A good basic watch for my tween.
3.0,"I bought two pairs of these for my 3 month old.  She's of average size and they didn't fit.  I think we could have possibly made them work except that they had NO stretch whatsoever and were also a very odd shape...short and wide.  Bummed, because the colors are fantastic and these or the other pair I bought would have matched just about everything she owns.  I didn't consider buying a larger size because of how stiff and wide they are."
3.0,Very cute but not as long as it is in the photo
3.0,"It's okay, not what I thought it was but it was cheap so I'm not too disappointed & I can live with it. Don't know if I'll wear it or not though..."
3.0,"I ordered the green mirror aviators, but the color you can see most is purple. They look somewhat green when the light hits them just the right way, but they don't look as green as in the pictures. These sunglasses still look ok thought, even if they aren't really what I expected."
3.0,Not very stretchy. They run short. They don’t feel airy and breathable. They are not as nice as other pants of this style I bought in the past. The cut is strange. I can’t wear these out. Will wear only to lounge as they aren’t well made.
3.0,I love the necklace. Exceeded my expectations. The chain was cheap quality and the clasp was.damaged .
3.0,I love the glasses although they are a little big on my head.
3.0,A great shirt with good quailty. The only conplaint it that I ordered an XL to make up for shrinkage after washing it as well as size differences. It arrived and felt like a medium/small. If you are wanting a small/medium shirt order the XL!!
3.0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED TOO SMALL.
3.0,Product didn’t meet expectations when reviewing photo
3.0,Bigger than i imagined I wont use it.  Gave it to my son and he likes it.
3.0,They are very stylish but won’t last long. The leather quality is not good
3.0,These masks are not too thicc or too thin.. They fit perfectly.. One of the masks didn't come with both of the strap tighteners but that's ok.. I kinda feel like Hannibal Lecter when wearing the 😷.. 🤣😂 The inside lining of the mask is like the material of the sheets you see at a motel.. 🤷🏾‍♀️ (Thin and breathable).. I can actually breathe in while wearing these masks and not have the mask sticc to my nostrils preventing air from entering.. 👍🏾👍🏾
3.0,Not a slim fit... and overall appeared darker in person than in the image.
3.0,What you can expect for the money
3.0,Good for swimsuit cover up.
3.0,"I'm 5'7, 140 lbs and the small fit great (female). Sadly, the print on the shirt was of average quality."
3.0,A bit on the cheap side..but for the price it was a good buy.
3.0,The little piece that you insert the strap into already broke. I wasn’t even rough on it :(
3.0,Very pretty but very small. Bought a X-lg and was a better fit for my niece who is a size 1.
3.0,"I liked the neck of this top, the fabric, and the overall fit. I returned this item because while the left armhole fit just fine, the right armhole was smaller and was too tight. Even if you were not wearng this top, you could have looked at it and noticed how the fabric was drawing and pulling on the wearer."
3.0,Why doesn’t it come with the screws needed to assemble the base?
3.0,"Nice shirt and pattern, but I like shirts tighter, and this one was a bit bulky for me."
3.0,Love dress fits great but swags to long I’m too short
3.0,"I do not recommend buying the flip-flops, because the quality appears to be poor.  I thought for this price I am getting really good quality flip-flops. After only several months of wearing them, they broke without any stress applied to them.  There is no warranty to replace them.<br /><br />I have to admit that customer service was really amazing.  I explained what happened sent photos and got replacement within 3 days!  I hope this pair will last long."
3.0,Returned it as it was too large and the neck part seems to be too deep to my comfort.
3.0,"Sizing seems to fit street size. I’m 5’4” 120 lbs and wear a size 4 in dress and the size 4 worked great. Thick material and nice overal quality. Giving it 3 stars because the ruffle really isn’t there. Just looks like random long cuts and it just hangs low. There’s another review of a gal wearing this stating the same thing and her dress is basically how mine was. That was disappointing. Sheeer under skirt with a soft fabric cut up on top so it did not blend too well. Not sure if a petticoat under would help this dress or not, but the material around the chest was very good quality. Packaged well and came faster then expected."
3.0,"I really like this watch. It's got a wonderful, solid feel to it. Setting it was nice and simple, both the date and the time. Operating the stopwatch is easy. I like the feel of the buttons and the positive click they have. The watch face is stylish and cool.<br /><br />However, it's all attached to a wretched band. It's really bad. I don't have very thick wrists (at all) and this band was almost too small for me. The material is kind of crappy. It feels scratchy. It's hard to tuck the strap into the keepers, which also look like crap.<br /><br />Keep the watch. Ditch the band."
3.0,"nice looking jean, fit large and the material is very HEAVY!!!! I felt like a was wearing a pair of jeans made of armor.  These are just not comfortable to me...."
3.0,One size definitely does NOT fit all.  It’s huge on me.
3.0,"I really like the colors and how it fit. For the price tho it started to come unraveled and lost a bead, I had to repair it myself."
3.0,The quality is not worth the price. You could find similar for chwaper at fprever 21.
3.0,Very attractive but would not fit any charm bracelet I had. Opening just a little bit too small. Beware of RESTOCKING FEE on return.
3.0,"You get what you pay for...It looks okay, but the fabric is scratchy.  For the price, I suppose it’s not bad if you just want a new look and you only wear the blouse a few times.... I returned it, regardless of the great price."
3.0,Ordered 2 different colors according to the picture and received both same color
3.0,"The cups don't fit very well, and the material isn't as thick as some reviewers had given me hopes. If you have a long torso, this is not for you."
3.0,It's not the worst but not the best. I'm a 36ish C/D and l got a Large. Fit well but was too big on the bottom part. Just didnt look right. Might work well on someone else.
3.0,The material is kind of different. Very cute.
3.0,Adorable sandals but the footbed is like walking on cement. I would recommend them if you aren't walking very far.
3.0,Nice and wlll fitted
3.0,"I do like the jacket. It will look cute with jeans or leggings add a scarf, however it’s not soft like Sherpa like I expected. I got on a lightening deal so for the price I will definitely keep it."
3.0,I purchased 2 of these for my 8 year old son. It is exactly what I was looking for. The only problem is the velcro on the back to fasten it behind the neck. The little velcro pieces keep pulling out of the velcro strip on the rough side. I am going to have to replace the velcro with a better quality piece. Also the round holes that hold the valves in the mask are pretty big but the valves haven't fallen out so far. Also customer service with my first mask was great.
3.0,Cute top but two issues. 1. If you have broad shoulders like myself then the sleeve caps don't cover your shoulders. So I was disappointed with this. 2. The top is very see through.
3.0,"Purchased one for myself, and two for gifts.  The pocket can hold my OnePlus 6t, and still has room for a few more items.<br /><br />Would be nicer if it was a little longer.  When looped twice it hangs/sits higher than I'd prefer, tho that might not be the case for women with smaller/flat chests.  Basically, when my phone is in the pocket, it's resting on my breast.  I just might start a trend and wear it as a sash.  LOL 😆"
3.0,The material is really nice however it didn't fit as expected.  The gaps between the buttons are too wide and reveal your undergarments and skin.  It may be simply just sizing up from your regular size.
3.0,"I started getting serious about weightlifting awhile back so I bought a cheap pair of 3/4 length compression shorts to wear on leg day. They felt great. Even though the fabric was on the thin side, they made my muscles feel primed and ready to go. So I knew I had to get a few more pairs. I didn't want to shell out the money for Under Armor or Nike since my cheap pair got the job done, but I didn't want to go all in on a brand I'd never tried before. So I tried several. I bought a pair from Baleaf, Tesla, and SUB. All were full length except for the Baleaf pair which was 3/4. Thus far they've all been great and are significant improvements over my first pair. My only complaint is that the waistband on the Baleaf is too thin and will occasionally slide down a bit. If I had to pick one I'd probably go with SUB. It has fewer seams and is less restrictive. The Tesla is more breathable however and gave me just the right amount of length whereas the SUB was a tad long. Still, the overall comfort I receive from my SUBs is enough to give it the edge. It's a great buy."
3.0,Way too big for me so gave to neighbor. But appeared to have good padding and would have worked well for paddling if they were my size. Went by measurements in guide so I would order size down.
3.0,"Very hard to adjust size and tends to scratch kids, which I didn't think about when I bought a medal watch. Works well and is very pretty"
3.0,"the large size was slightly small, and make sure you wash them by hand and in cold water as they shrink."
3.0,"Very cute and flowly. I wnjoted wearing this and got compliments. It did fit a littlw big and i woyld have returned it if I paid full price, but I got it heavoly discounted and could not beat that price."
3.0,I read the reviews about the size. My son is 10 and he wears size 12. So I ordered size 16 so he can grow in it for three years or so. I was so disappointed how pant didnt fit my son. If you have husky son. Do not buy this. However it will fit my slim middle son.
3.0,"This handmade bracelet is kind of cute. I can't really imagine what an adult would wear it with, but it's an okay piece of costume jewelry for teens and preteens. It's just very simple and slightly ornamental.<br /><br />No price currently listed on it, so I'm not sure whether it's a good value or not. Might be good party favors if your younger one is having a Little Mermaid or Moana party."
3.0,"Baggy mostly on the top.  I am 5'3"" and 125 pounds.  Small dresses usually fit me perfectly.  Too bad, because I really like the dress and the colors....the length was perfect too for a short person.  (Not too long, as many dresses are on me.)  I gave it to my sister who is broader shouldered and weighs a few more pounds.. She loves it!"
3.0,Average quality.  Fit is ok.
3.0,"Very adorable if you are a petite, size 2 person.  I am a 170 pound woman of 54.  What in the heck was I thinking?????<br />Newly divorced, midlife crisis?  Thought I would get a date. Lol.  I'm over it.<br />I have a lot of lingerie never worn. For sake. Lol!"
3.0,El bestido está bonito pero muy pequeño y estoy intentando regresar el pequeño y el vendedor pone una etiqueta muy pequeña<br />Para poder regresarlo ya intentamos de varias formas  en ups y no se puede leer  y no tienen un número de teléfono para poder hablarles
3.0,It’s fits on the smaller side and it doesn’t lay right. I’m not impressed with it.
3.0,"Overall dress was very pretty, I purchased this item for a 1920's themed Christmas party. The under slip was extremely short and I struggled to keep it down underneath the dress. The overall dress was shorter than I hoped for making it difficult to wear with short heels. The dress fit very loose around the waist area and gave me a box shape, I'm 5'4 135 lbs, I normally wear a small. I had to pin the under slip and dress for a better fit. It was a pretty dress but I wont be wearing it again."
3.0,"I like the band quality, feel and price but the the spring rods provided with it are cheap and flimsy.  The watch has popped off my wrist about 5 times in the 2-3 weeks I've had it and I have to remount the band once I find the spring rod."
3.0,Depends on having eyeglasses that this won’t slip off of the end. Some will some won’t.
3.0,Material is heavier than T-shirt and not very breathable. To warm for summer even tho summer shirt
3.0,"Beautiful socks and well made. However, the stitching in the calves is so tight that I can't get it over my heels. Mind you, I'm an average sized female trying to wear socks for a larger male... So, disappointing. Got them for my husband and he couldn't get them over the arch of his foot."
3.0,"Basic time piece that will probably last several years, but it has 2 weaknesses:  1)  the light is not bright enough to make the dial readable in a dark room, and 2) the alarm is so soft, only those with the sharpest hearing will be aware of it.  Otherwise, the watch is highly accurate and displays the day, date and month."
3.0,"My daughter LOVES this backpack and the beanie is super cute.  Unfortunately, the lights keep falling out of the pre-made holes.  For the price of the bag, this shouldn't be an issue.  Wish I could give it 4-5 stars, but we literally have the adjust the lights every single day."
3.0,I received my bracelet in a timely manner.  Although within a few days one of the snaps broke ( I superglued it) This was exactly what I expected
3.0,"I thought this was going to have the extra holding section just for my iphone, based on the images that I saw.  I am disappointed and might look for something else.  I love the look and the overall product, but I feel mislead by the photos within the product description. I thought I was just picking out the color, which I love!"
3.0,These are a little &#34;sloppy&#34; feeling on my foot. Too loose. I prefer a snug fit.
3.0,Fabric very thin.
3.0,"its a good quality but the cap is very small. i have a small head too lol. would but more from seller though, quality is excellent"
3.0,"Looks great, but too big to be worn as a necklace, at least for my girlfriend.  Ended up being a decoration as opposed to jewelry."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it fits like a small. I'm not disappointed in these pants' quality because once you get them on they look so amazing. I'm not going to return them because I love them so much and might be able to loosen up<br />the waist / legs to a more favorable liking. If you're a medium, order a large."
3.0,On the small side.  Can't wear glasses underneath like I could with older pair.  Pretty cheap price but also very cheaply made.  Doesn't seal great (lets snow in).  Will probably give to the kids.
3.0,These charms were cute but they came in a cheap little dirty zip lock bag and I was giving these as a gift.
3.0,"Comfortable in all areas except for the waistline. Unfortunately this cut into me, just exactly what I was trying not to find. Unlike some of the  reviews here, the package was professional and clean, no problems there."
3.0,"I walk for exercise outdoors, and with the cold weather, I got these boots to keep my feet warmer.  That part worked, but when I was walking in some of the snowier parts of the neighborhood and golf course, I noticed that when the soles of these shoes/boots would get wet, they tended to ""slip"", and I mean slip as in nearly falling down, like I hit a patch of oil.  I would only recommend these if you're walking in a dry environment, like maybe a mall, if people still do that"
3.0,Some of the rubber trim came off but they are otherwise holding up great. Hard to clean though.
3.0,"Loved this dress but the ruffles had a 1inch seam which made the dress seem more casual. I’m petite and I tried to pin it but my breasts were still showing more than is generally appropriate for social events. I would’ve loved to have tried an XS if it was available. For reference, I’m 5’1, 120 and 36c"
3.0,"A bit larger than expected, lucky we won't need it for another 2-3 months so my duaghter should grow into it<br />material is nice, isn't really a bathing suit"
3.0,Too glossy
3.0,"The chokers arrived on time and looked great upon arrival, but after I tried them on, 2 of the clasps broke. However, for the price, they're pretty good quality, and they're great if you're not going to wear them often."
3.0,The shirt is very short. I am 5’1 and usually a small is even long on me.
3.0,"big and boxy, returned."
3.0,"These are very nice looking, not cheap looking at all. Only draw back is it doesn’t always stay put & then it looks weird. You just have to have the right size ears to wear as pictured."
3.0,This was cute but fits more like a shirt. I’m 5’6 and I got a L it was way too small. I think even an XL would be too small honestly
3.0,I just didn't like it that much because it is not as dark as it looks on the pic. It is more transparent. It fits pandora but not the color.
3.0,Though I liked the product and feel that it is a good value for the price...the colors were not as described.  I did not receive a brown set. The colors in the photo are accurate but the colors listed in text are incorrect. I messaged the seller ....but was unable to communicate satisfactorily.
3.0,"I blame myself for sizing issues at times, but this was so tiny! I ordered a large and couldn’t get it past my elbows. I recommend sizing about 2-3 sizes, besides that, the quality and shade of blue were great!"
3.0,Color is not same as shown
3.0,"This is a beautiful color of purple and it fits great.  The back has a one strap racer type back.  Then from about mid back down it splits and is open.  Which is very good for ventilation when exercising or walking.  However, it does show quite a bit of skin.  But it is a nice top for exercise with a nice sports bra underneath.  I probably won't be able to wear it though because it is made primarily of a wool blend and my skin doesn't do too well with wool :(.<br /><br />*If this review has been helpful to you, please let me know by clicking the ""Helpful"" button below.  Thanks!*"
3.0,Good size. Lightweight. I just wish the design was on both sides. Because the earring flips over a lot.
3.0,Cute shoes but way too small. I usually wear an 8.5 so I ordered a 9. They are way too small.
3.0,Perfect for kids but for most adults I think the wrists size is more suitable for kids.
3.0,If you are looking to match something highly do not recommend color does not match description “Emerald” is definitely christmas tree green.
3.0,I purchased 3 of these in different colors. I love the dresses however even though I ordered several sizes larger (the largest size available) than I would normally order they still fit too snuggly for me to feel comfortable wearing them without a sweater. The fabric is VERY lightweight like competition swimwear I wore as a teen. Admittedly I have gained about 10# since ordering. Delivery took 2 months. The pockets are in an awkward place. Perhaps if I can lose weight again I will get some use out of them. I HOPE so because I really like them.
3.0,Arrived as advised. Product is just as it was described. Have not wore it yet.
3.0,Much smaller than expected. You can barely tell it’s a cat on the earrings. Good price though.
3.0,"This is super cute and I love it. It is a bit smaller than I expected. It isn't worth returning and I am currently working to get back into pre baby shape so it will fit better in the future, but it isn't something I would wear right now. Which is sad because out of the three different styles I purchased ( different brands all same size) this is the only one that didn't fit and I expected it to be my favorite."
3.0,"The pants are fine, pretty snug fit but the primary reason I returned them is I was looking for a warmer fabric."
3.0,Like them but thought they were a darker green
3.0,"Warm, great soles but no cushion in the footbed.  I really wanted to love these as my favorite Acorn slippers have been discontinued.  After standing for 12 hours each day on concrete, I need more cushion....."
3.0,"I kept it, but I was surprised by how Small it runs"
3.0,"The red is not as deep as in the amazon picture. It’s too light but for $18, whatever. I’m between sizes so I ordered a size small and it bunches up at the waist. I’m 132 pounds and 5’3” for reference."
3.0,"Okay! So it’s a super cute dress! The fabric is very lightweight and soft. However, I have 3 out of 5 stars because I ordered this dress in two colors. Based on other reviews I ordered a size down. I am normally an XL but ordered large. One of the dresses fit perfectly and the other was skin tight! Exact same dress in different colors, ordered the same day, tried on the same day!"
3.0,not as long as I had hoped
3.0,I wear compression sleeves a lot. This is not my favorite product.
3.0,The wiring started to stick out after wearing it for a week.
3.0,The shipping was amazingly fast. Arrived early on 3/30.. with the projected delivery date  of 4/10-28. I was thrilled. The pattern was really pretty. I liked it a lot. However the sizing is a bit off since it's pretty much a one-size -fit-all which makes it less that suitable for the very slim people. I found that it was larger than I expected and the legs are a bit baggy. The elastic waist is what I expected from something that's only $16 for a product that Nike and others are selling for over $100. However the fabric isn't the same quality of those other vendors.  It's not going to wick sweat and moisture so these are for walking my dog as well as doing more pilates stuff rather than faster/harder/sweat-inducing workouts<br />The price though can't be beat but  It is a case of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.
3.0,It made a nice gift.
3.0,"Very cheap, thin material for the plaid ruffle romper.  I expected it to be that way since it was such a cheap price and it would have still been adorable except it was way too small.  My daughter just turned 2 and the 2/3 size looked like 18 months.  Really disappointed because returning something like this without free returns is a hassle."
3.0,Only wore once pockets tearing and fabric stretching. What I guess you should expect for $12
3.0,"They’re ok, not the best for the price. The material is thinner than expected and they’re a little tight around the ears. They did come a lot sooner than expected. I think they’d do the trick doubled up."
3.0,"My som has worn this every day and we were so excited about it! Unfortunately, we noticed today that the QR code has worn away and is completely useless! Disappointed for sure."
3.0,Cool concept!  Looks sleek but light weight cheepo leather.  I do like the buckle!
3.0,Thinner and shorter than I expected. Took nearly a month to arrive. Sending it back for a refund. Hope that doesn't take as long as the delivery did.
3.0,"This pullover sweatshirt / hoodie is made of 57% cotton and 43% polyester.  It’s your typical smooth on the outside, and “fuzzy” on the inside.  This is a fairly heavy item.  The “Undefined” graphic on the front is made out of that “rubbery” substance that will melt / crack if you place it in a very hot dryer, so you have to be a little careful.  This sweatshirt is Made in Indonesia.  It measures 28.5” from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  The sleeves measure 27” from where they are attached at the shoulder to the end.  It measures 24” across.  There is a “kangaroo pocket” in the front, where you place your hands inside each side.  This is a very “generic” sort of item, but overall it’s fine."
3.0,I really couldn't get my arms in this. It is not true to size at all. Nice cloth and it is soft but that's as far as I got with this item
3.0,It has a very tough texture for the clouds and very much small order 2 sizes up
3.0,The necklace get tangled very easily and is doesn't lay well.
3.0,Nice cute but work on I phone mostly and hole in between finger after few uses
3.0,It is a travel body pillow so not sure what I really expected but it was more than this. It felt like sleeping on a pool float. It did the job but is definitely not a replacement for a pillow. I will definitely take camping and to the lake but likely not for business travel.
3.0,"the shirt itself is really cute and fit right, nothing wrong with the shirt. my only issue and reason for the 3 star rating is because i ordered the shirt March 15th and im barely now getting it today (april 20th) a whole 5 weeks later, which at that point i was just better off going somewhere in person to find a regular guns n roses t shirt and just cutting it myself.....kind of makes it not worth it."
3.0,I thought the necklace was going to be a little more like actually silver or metal but it came with this super fake metal chain and wasnt all that nice of quality but for 9 dollars what can you expect
3.0,Seems nice.
3.0,One pair doesn't match.
3.0,"i returned, runs really small"
3.0,"This is NOT t-shirt material.  Hard to describe.  But certainly not cotton.  Not soft.  Almost ""sticky"" feel.  Design is awesome, but haven't washed it."
3.0,"This tunic definitely runs big! I'm 5ft 115lbs and I was swimming in a small. The material is super soft and the color was as described. I did find it quite odd that when I opened my Amazon package, this tunic was packaged in a &#34;Great Value&#34; brand Ziploc bag (within the box)... so it makes me think it was returned once before unless the seller packages their products in Ziploc bags from Wal-Mart? Kind of interesting."
3.0,This dress is beautiful! Its well made and nice material except the weird under lining is 2 sizes smaller than the dress...<br />Im giving this item only a 3 star because i ordered a 3 X and this is like a Medium at best...<br />I saw it ran small... so i ordered 2 sizes up... to all the actual 3 X people just NO... this dress is for a small framed small to med forget it if u have any boobs at all...
3.0,"I was so excited to get this romper, and it arrived on time, was packaged nicely. It even fit like a glove, until I zipped it. The zipper completely malfunctioned on me. It literally came off the tracks on both sides. I didn't have enough time to sent it back s I rigged it, and it ended up working out fine, but only after altering it. The zipper was the entire reason why I chose this specific product. I needed something that was easy to get in and out of. But overall it was what I wanted, it just was a bit defected."
3.0,"I really wanted to love these. In all honesty they feel very light, fragile even. They will serve the purpose, but I really thought they would be sturdier. Disappointed. Would not recommend."
3.0,Would be a 5 star but one of the snap buttons fell off rather soon.
3.0,"Decent husky hat with mittens, adult sized. Has good features, but is fairly thin. I have a spirit hoods for comparison, and it is a big difference. This might be good for warmer temperatures, but I didnt find it all too comfortable because it was thin. Personal preference probably. Great value for the price though."
3.0,Beautiful piece but just for way to small I would love to see this if it fit me correctly
3.0,"The dress looks good, but had a lot of loose strings from poor quality sewing.  While the dress fit my waist and below just fine..it gapped under the armpits and across my back.  It was not see through which was much appreciated and it flouresced well under a black light.  All in all a decent costume that worked well for dancing once I took it in."
3.0,"I love the dress....the belt is useless. I haven't been able to wear the dress yet because it would not look right without the belt since the dress has belt loops that can just be ""cut off"". The buckle for the belt is way too big for the width of the fabric belt. The belt comes right off because there is not tension to keep it on. So, I'm trying to find a matching plastic belt buckle that will fit. Or a belt that matches, until then, the dress just hangs in my closet."
3.0,"I ordered 3 sets (2 in medium and 1 in large).  The mediums ran a little on the small side, and one set had an obvious seaming flaw.  The large was ok.  They have held up over time and use though."
3.0,"I ordered an 11/12 for my daughter who wears a 10/12. I was surprised to see that it was so thin and hoping that that wouldn't mean that it was sheer as well. Thankfully, it is not sheer, but it is lightweight and breathable. It fits well mostly, if not a little big. It is a bit low, but maybe as she gets a little bigger then that won't be such an issue. It has already stained. I can't say that this is the best quality. I have a feeling that it will stretch out the more that it is worn, and could snag easily."
3.0,"Large.  I order two sizes for my sons.  On is on the border of 4T-5T and my other is 12m-18m.  My older son was able to fit into the smaller size it was a tad short on the arms but could where it.  The 4T-5t size or 130, the arms are way to long.  More like a 5/6. Way too big."
3.0,I wear & order a lot of puma from the clothes shoes visors to Sox this dress was just ok I didn’t like the fit little to tight
3.0,"Good color and fits nice. However, it’s veey thin and I feel like it just hangs there off me but showing all the bra straps/parts of I don’t wear a cami. Thin like Lularoe but maybe even thinner."
3.0,"I ordered my regular size and it was just a smidge too tight. The opening is also a little too high for my taste, but it can easily be sewn together for modesty."
3.0,Not bad. It's deffently not the best quality.
3.0,Shirts are small.
3.0,I am not sure if they are damaged or not. One side got little screws and the other side missing them.
3.0,"It is a beautiful Bow tie  for little boys, However we will be saving it for a couple years until my five-year-old grandson can grow into it."
3.0,"Looked like a decent belt for the money. It arrived very quickly, hence the 3 stars instead of 1, but one of the snaps was broken when I took it out of the package."
3.0,"Pom pom are nice & will be fuller once I get by the blow dryer to them but the hardware is cheap. The lobster claps either don’t close, overlap or have a jagged sharp edge. I’ll replace the hardware to something sturdier."
3.0,A little bulky but a very good quality hat.
3.0,"While this dress was super cute and fit perfectly, it’s made from super thin cotton. It’s  so thin you can see right through it no matter what you’re wearing underneath. After trying it on a few times I decided to return it. Wearing 3 layers underneath was a no go for me."
3.0,"Returned, not good quality. Cheap fabric"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress but had the same problem with it as I have with most fitted dresses. Simply put they are not made for anyone with a true hourglass shape. Chest 34, waist 24 hips 36, height 5'7"" weight 140.  The fit was great in the chest, hips and thighs and I really liked the cut and color. Sadly the waist had too much extra material, I could have fit and additional 5 pounds in there with me. Sadly am returning them, but not for any fault of the dress or seller."
3.0,"Sizing seemed way off. Ordered a size up, but did not fit right at all. Color and material seemed nice."
3.0,Too big.  Had to a give to a friend with bigger feet. They are cute though.
3.0,The hell looks shorter in person
3.0,"Was not as advertised.  Was not organic cotton!  As a regular pajamas, they are ok."
3.0,It even gave you the choice of size and I chose the larger size. They're still too small for my size 10 feet. They constantly slipped off all day.
3.0,"Material is okay. But it makes your feet looks bigger, as duck feet."
3.0,I loved the sweatshirt but was definitely not oversized.
3.0,"Mine came out fine, a little messed up on the underneath, but you can barely tell. My sister's paint, or whatever they use, was messed up and it bled a bit into that cross shape. I would give mine a four, and hers a two, so three stars."
3.0,It was beautiful for the first couple of weeks but it started to go down hill when the gems fell off one by one. If your looking for something that will hold up for years this is not the pair of earrings to buy.
3.0,"I was expecting the yellow to be more of a mustard yellow, but it was more of a true yellow and it was pretty sheer."
3.0,"Ordered the green sweater, did not love it.  The product looks better on the model."
3.0,The smell honestly is enough for me to say don’t get it. But after I washed a few times it was okay. it is not at all sweat proof material. If it’s gonna be a work out shirt just be prepared for it to get soaking wet and dark grey on sweat prone areas.
3.0,"It is ok, however WAY TO LARGE!"
3.0,"I was going to buy these off Amazon but happened to see them in a store. I tried them on and although they look great on, they were also uncomfortably stiff and hard. The sole is not padded at all and being so chunky my feet hurt just from walking around in them in the store. On the other hand, if your feet can take that kind of treatment, by all means get this stylish pair."
3.0,Really cute but it did not fit he charm bracelet intended form
3.0,Very cute dress. Loved it but it runs very small. I normally wear a size 8 so bought med as indicated and I could barely get in on. I would need an extra large.
3.0,A little thicker than expected but very cozy
3.0,it works decent except when clipping it onto the controller it either presses the sync button or the xbox button
3.0,Not sure what the prior review was talking about in regards to stone being a bit large. This ring was NOT even  2.5 carats with the side diamonds. This is a one carat stone visually. They do this by some  CZ weight which is lighter than diamond. The ring in photo next to this one is a 2.0 carat stone to show differernce.I retrurned and was refunded. Pretty ring otherwise.
3.0,"This was super cute, had to return due to fit but wish it would have fit. I'm busty and that may have been the issue for me."
3.0,This fit somewhat smaller than expected.  It is very thin and it shows every little skin imperfection.  It's fine to wear around house.  Bought this in hopes I could wear out and about during my pregnancy but it looks more like a night gown on me.
3.0,"I’m 5’3” 175 lbs with a 42 inches chest. I order the black/white/grey large pack. All three are labeled as large, the black and grey fit just about right but the white one is huge and I can’t wear it. Shirts are nice but tend to ride forward and you’ll find yourself adjusting it back often."
3.0,"I am 5'3 (5'4 on a good day) 160lbs, 38D, and normally wear a 10-12. at first I ordered the 4XL, because my weight fluctuate and I have no idea if anything smaller would fit. the 4XL came rather quickly but it fit a little big, so I ordered the 3XL, which fits fine but the boob size was too small I felt like the girls were hanging out in fresh air. I loved the design and everything and am very sad to return both because of the sizing :("
3.0,"Gave them to my daughter, stretches to fit your shape."
3.0,"l like it, but I knew from the reviews that it was smaller than advertised.  I'd say easily a foot or more shorter.  I'm still happy with it.  It's disappointing that so many people can get away with false information on Amazon.  Still a ton better than shopping on Overstock.com."
3.0,"I ordered two sets of these to include in gift earrings, because the backs can be transferred to other earrings; the backs are comfortable when you're pressing a phone to your ear, and that's important! They are not well made, though. The stones can easily pop out, and so I'm going to paint them all with clear nail polish, and I'm hoping that will glue them together. Some of the backs are not as deep inside as others, and this is another problem, because it may leave too much room behind your ear; this cannot usually be fixed by fiddling around with them. The size of them is very nice; most of this type are too big in the larger ball."
3.0,"I love the look and feel of this bag, however it did get a little wet in the rain and the zipper tarnished and turned a different silverlike color. The zipper handle turned a different color also, more bronze.<br /><br />I dried it off immedietly, and it was only a few drops."
3.0,"Love the length and style and color , and fit, good investment 🤠🤠🤠 Coco"
3.0,"Looks good but not great quality, but there again, it didn't cost much."
3.0,"I liked the dress, but one side is bigger than the other I won't return because it was really cheap and I can fix this. I hope it helped someone"
3.0,Arrived over 2 weeks late and after original arrival date I was no longer able to track the item. Quality of the metal is decent for the price. No rough or sharp edges. That's the only reason it got as good a rating as it got. I plan to swap out the closures as they are very large and almost tacky looking.
3.0,It was just ok!! I read that the material is thin not so...it is definitely a winter skirt because the material is thick. The colors were not as vibrant as I thought they would be and I paid about $35 to expidite the shipping. In the end I just don't feel the skirt was worth the price I paid. I was disappointed but I would give the company another chance.
3.0,The breast area does not fit right...there is little bit of excess fabric.
3.0,"nice belt,  it works, but the Buckle gets scratched during shipping"
3.0,Once I received the correct size the ring fits comfortably and looks nice
3.0,Bottoms fit great though.  Ok to lay out in but can’t do any active sports in.  Top runs small and the “girls” fall out
3.0,Cute! But shorter than I expected.
3.0,a little to tight.
3.0,"I bought the dress with the peach top and beige skirt. I loved the feel of this dress it is absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately, I am 5' 4 and this dress is way to long. I cannot avoid stepping on it. If that were the only problem I would keep it and hem it up, however, the bottom is very see thru. I will have to return it."
3.0,"Cheap, thin material and fuzzes. No use after a few wear."
3.0,I'ts a good little bag but smaller than I thought. I gave it to my wife because it looked like a little purse!
3.0,I use this as a cleaning dress...I am 5'10&#34; and the size is perfect but the slits come up to my booty:)
3.0,has very small amount of cashmere but for the money one would expect that.  It's generously sized.
3.0,"Not the most expensive Tallit, looks like it's made of cotton .... but will serve the purpose."
3.0,Unfortunately the zipper in back did not lay flat. Just a smidge on the tight side but a size up would have been much too large. Am 5’ 4.5”
3.0,"Love the fit, but unwearable under t-shirt material or similar."
3.0,nice but breaks easily. Only used it for several times
3.0,"too big and that red zipper is horrible, the pic doesn't show that , otherwise i won't get it."
3.0,Very wrinkled
3.0,I liked the style of the shorts it's just that they fitted me 2 small but product wise it's great
3.0,I like them very much. I'm even wearing them now.
3.0,Material was a little thinner than I thought
3.0,"A bit too much material on top, looks frumpy on me. Size small: 5'5"" 118#; not substantial material but it's stretchy and seemed comfy."
3.0,Love the look . Product was just too big hence my 3 stars
3.0,Really  flimsy
3.0,Longest tie clip I've ever seen. I should have paid more attention to its size. I will be returning it for a smaller/shorter one
3.0,Didn’t hold my phone very well
3.0,very tiny small enough for a 2 or 3 yr old
3.0,"Materials feels cheap.  Cute on, would  have kept it, but too tight in the chest area.  I’m a 34DD and ordered a large.  Returning it."
3.0,"I'm incredibly disappointed in the last 2 shirts I received from PattyBoutik. This shirt fits well and as expected, with luxuriously long sleeves. The material seems to be a nice quality, medium weight turtleneck, but the workmanship is poor. A seam on the underside of the armpit was not sewn together. I didn't notice at first, until I happened to raise my arm in the mirror. CHECK ALL OF THE SEAMS!<br /><br />If you appreciate me taking the time to review this product and my photos I'd appreciate if you marked that this review was helpful-thanks!"
3.0,Fabric is nice but they are very small.
3.0,Doesn't lay on the wrist as well as photo shows.
3.0,"I wear 36DDD and it did not fit me, it did not stay in place for me."
3.0,"Cute but small. Also the material feels like well, I'd prefer cotton for health purposes"
3.0,looks good with a Boho type dress
3.0,"Sizing is small. Seams on butt and crotch area are very uncomfortable and do not stretch. Also after only being worn and washed twice, they are running, as shown in picture."
3.0,Loved the way they fit and the color. Very comfortable too
3.0,"I sorta like them, but they were bigger than I thought. They remind me of Charlie & the chocolate factory when they go into the tv room. Almost like a steampunk I guess of those glasses."
3.0,It’s a watch band
3.0,"While the quality of the product is awesome, it didn't turn out to be a useful as I hoped"
3.0,"It's a really cute and trendy skirt however, I ordered the size XS( extra small) & it fits like a medium. I know this is suppose to be a boyfriend skirt, so I'm assuming it's suppose to fit large. Other wise I love it!"
3.0,Thin fabric Tear in one handkerchief<br />Would not recommend
3.0,Super comfortable but because all 3 of them are having the same problem I gave the 3 star. The zippers are coming undone from the seam
3.0,It's not the same fit as the blk 1 yet ther the same size🤔🤔
3.0,Tha cap is too big. Should have sizes. It's covering my eyes. Can't see where I'm going.
3.0,Made in China and low quality.
3.0,"Love the pattern and fabric, very flattering. I’m 5’5” 161 pnds, ordered large, it hugged my tummy which is not big but not toned either,  returned for XL hoping is not so huggy."
3.0,Don't like the material or the color.  They always appear to look dirty even when just washed.
3.0,Cute but a bit small and it doesn't have a metal piece around the nose. Its just a straight piece of fabric. No shape.
3.0,I bought these gloves for riding my bicycle. They are thin and I'm wondering how they will hold up in the wash. I should have bought the larger size but that's on me. They were inexpensive enough that I can easily replace them when they fall apart.
3.0,"Nice quality but I ordered a medium and got a large, which basically hangs to my knees. But it looks cute with leggings."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, needed a larger size but it's nice."
3.0,"Okay so I’m not that young, so maybe it’s just me… (I’ll preface this by saying they’re literally one of my favorite labels!) but I feel like if a company like EF is going to make a sweet little dress, it seems counterproductive to have it be see through at the side boob. The back isn’t cut out, so like, I wanna wear a bra! I don’t need to be scaring small children… or really even large adults! Y’all don’t WANT me to go braless… it’s not for everyone.<br />Okay, I’ve said my peace. (And yes, I meant ✌🏼, not “piece.” I’m super different, so I must mock society by changing it.) 🫠😵‍💫<br />Oh! And it runs at least a half size small. No stretch in this one, ladies!"
3.0,These were the perfect size for my septum not too big and not too small. It was snug on my septum just the way I like it. The only thing I had a problem with was it was sharp around the part where it bent when it opened. I tried filing it down to get smooth and it didn't work. I will not be using them due to this issue. I wish this wasn't the case because I really liked all three colors and the size.
3.0,"These are cute little hummingbirds.  Unfortunately, after one day, they caused a severe skin reaction.  It was gross.  I’ve had minor irritation before but this was far beyond any jewelry irritation I’ve ever had.  It says nickel free and I guess I’ll take them at their word considering I’m not going to spend $35 on a test kit.  I wonder if they’re plated with something else to prevent tarnishing."
3.0,I love the dress its cute but the fit is soo completely wrong I ordered a medium and it is waaay to big its just not flattering at all but the back is super cute lol
3.0,I was surprised that I have to continue to wind up this watch.  I should have researched what I was buying.  This is my first experience with a hand wind mechanical watch. It is a good looking watch but I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"I mean...it fits. Way too much padding for my taste, but it fits and I don't feel like returning it."
3.0,Very comfortable for as long as they last. the grip on the black part works well but started coming apart after5 rounds.. May still be worth the money
3.0,It isn’t the real Chakram necklace like Creation Entertainment sells. Xena’s Chakram has two different design side. The sharp edge and the Straight (square) edge... on this necklace both sides have the sharp edge.
3.0,"I do love that this dress has pockets. I pretty much only want clothes with pockets nowadays. Unfortunately the fit is just not flattering. While the chest area fits as far as not too big or small, the contours are very unflattering. Also the dress kind of has a fit and flare look, yet it still hit me right in the stomach lump. It just isn't right for my body type."
3.0,"Took 2 months + to receive and was way too small. Forgot to take into account size difference between American and Asian people. Had to reorder a larger size. Nice novelty ""shirt""."
3.0,love the watch but the band is not quite long enough for a comfortable fit.
3.0,"COLOR WAS FADED, DINT LOOK THAT GREAT."
3.0,"These ballet tights are soft & thick & the right color, but definitely not ""true to size"". I got a size small for my daughter who is 41"" tall. The size chart mentions that the small is suitable for 35"" to 43"" so these should have been just right; however, I can pull the waist up to her armpits & there's still a massive amount of fabric pooling around her legs. I'd say these would be suitable if she was maybe 48""+. It's a shame because I really like them."
3.0,Cute but the heart is WAY smaller then I expected.. you can barely see the monogram
3.0,"These are kind of cute, but totally made of plastic and not the high quality kind. I don’t really like that my phone appears distorted through the lenses, however they do block the sun pretty well."
3.0,Was tight on my hips and the to was not long enough
3.0,Cheaply made.  Smells strange.  The flowers didn’t lay flat they stuck out in a weird way
3.0,"Waaaay too big. I was hoping for a smaller fit. I ordered XXL, I am 5.4 and 145lbs. I am not a returner so I will give it to one of my taller buddies."
3.0,"Its a great belt but Like what other reviewers said, its too wide in width especiall for petite female like me. So, im gonna have to return it. Just doesnt work well for me."
3.0,"Good quality, not see through like many others I have tried! They are a bit long for a Capri... The only thing I didn't like about them is the elasic, it's pretty tight and makes roll. The fit really nice except for the elasic being to tight. I feel like they are a little pricy. I'm going to return mine because of the elastic issue.. I am a size 16 I ordered the XL, been searching for a &#34;relaxed fit&#34; lounge Capri for a long time, I hate the  &#34;skinny&#34; fit if most yoga capris... The search is still on."
3.0,"You know when you order a piece of clothing online and it turns out to be great so you order another in a different color but that second one is completely different from the original in some way and you come away sorely disappointed? That's what happened to me here. I ordered black and it's perfect. Nice fit, flattering, comfy material- lightweight but soft and not see-through. So I ordered a second one in red, and the material is SO VERY THIN that it is unwearable. It's garbage. I thought about cutting it up for rags but its not even fit for that. Very disappointing."
3.0,"These are okay. You get what you pay for. They do start to lose their color after a while, and you need to check to make sure the balls stay tight -- I never checked and after about 3 months I lost one of the balls. Luckily I had one from another set but it doesn't match."
3.0,"I luv everything about this bag but it was just a lil too big that's all , everything else is great !"
3.0,"These memory foam house slippers are cute but are a little narrow at the front.  I ordered my usual size 7, and it seems to be too crowded for my toes at the front area when I walk.  The widest width at the front is 3.5 inches.  For me, I could not wear socks while wearing these slippers.  The available length for the foot is 9 inches.  I say “available”, because there is a 1/2 inch raised lip around the heel.  As far as comfort, it is soft when I walk on it, but the narrow front offsets that comfort.  I didn’t really get any arch support that is being stated in the description.  The tread is not substantial.  I wouldn’t walk on a wet surface with these slippers.  The upper is made of 100% polyester.  I didn’t feel sweaty wearing them, though.  In summary, I would order one size up, especially if you like wearing socks in the winter with slippers.  I gave these 3 stars, because of the narrow front and the lack of good bottom tread."
3.0,They look nice but are way too big. Returned.
3.0,"Not the best fit, disappointed that they didn't fit as I expected them to fit.  Time to order another pair of shoes, what a bummer."
3.0,"Me quedaron un poco grande, principalmente la talla  XL que me enviaron cambiada, por lo demás están bien"
3.0,Works better than a traditional rack but still not perfect. There are still gaps between some balls
3.0,"Love the coat, size is perfect,  but it does not have a fur collar like it shows in the picture. Slighty upset about that. Thay was half the reason I bought it."
3.0,It’s a top.<br />I suggest buying anything  but white.
3.0,I like it daughter doesn’t
3.0,"The only pair i am not a fan of are the ones with gold on them, they came tarnished. The other two are perfect tho... light weight and cute"
3.0,I Expected them to be thick sweat pants
3.0,The earrings look exactly like the pictures to an extent they are really thin earrings they would bend and break easily for the price I will have to send them back
3.0,I bought 2 of these dresses for a wedding. It's a nice dress but the sashes for both dresses were a different color/shades (very noticeable). I just went to my local JoAnn's fabric store and bought material to make sashes. Other than that it is a nice dress.
3.0,"Very Cut, but too flimsy"
3.0,Lenses are mirrored and dark.  Exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered them.  Frames are a clear plastic and a bit small for me.  Not what I wanted. I'm a large person so I understand far better than most that one size does NOT fit all.  I lose or leave behind a couple pair of sunglasses per year so will certainly keep these and use them until they too disappear into the sunglass abyss.
3.0,much bigger than anticipated which also means heavier than anticipated
3.0,I Love The colors
3.0,One pair broke at the stud after one wear and I got 2 sets of duplicate earrings. But for the price it will be nice to have this selection
3.0,Gets hot wearing that mask. It torn as I was putting it on.
3.0,"Good price but one of the cufflinks is rusty on the back, which stinks. Not sure if I'd buy again."
3.0,Fit perfectly yet didn't care for belt (cheap 1 sided)... Flow & cut of dress was nice
3.0,They were cute on picture but big and flimsy in person:(
3.0,Really pretty but was too small!
3.0,"Material is nice but too small. I have to wear it under a hoodie besides coming to my waist and if I reach , well lets say oh no!<br />The long sleeve Tee is ok and even roomy. I love the PJ brand and own several pairs of pants and a few tops. The gray tee is the only thing I have had an issue with."
3.0,Nice with leggings!!! Really comfortable
3.0,"First things first, this is a very cute jacket.  It is so soft, comfortable, and fits great, so the positives are a plenty.<br /><br />I think the main issue with this is the overall durability.  After only a couple of washes, there was already a considerable amount of wear that is showing and this is just after some normal use.  Overall, a great jacket, but don't see this lasting long."
3.0,Pretty but missing a stone.
3.0,The clasps break easily
3.0,"The shoes are extremely small. This is my 2nd pair of shoes that have been returned for a bigger size! My 3yr old son wears a size 10 (we know they run small from experience with my 6yr olds' shows), so we bought my 2yr old size 11... Way too small. Returned those & went up to 12.5... Now way to small again! I'm almost red of returning the shoes, my son gets happy then I have to let him down with another return! How can we contact the seller? I haven't seen any link to contact you.<br />The return process has been fairly easy but, will be calling Amazon tonight because I did not get my full refund on the gift card..."
3.0,The padding inside the cup area moves around to easily.
3.0,"Everyone says it looks great. I am not wild about he material. It is stretch nylon, which I did no really get from the description."
3.0,"Cute set, but clearly looks fake. Cute set for the cost."
3.0,"it seems like a nice dress, until you put it on. the diagonal shoulder lines didnt sit well on me, perhaps because i'm not super flat chested, it bulged out and looked frumpy. had to return, but the construction seemed okay. color is a nice mellow yellow."
3.0,"This picture appears to have a longer hem in front than back.  I found the opposite to be true, which I did not find flattering.  Also, I would have expected a 'miracle' suit to provide tummy support, but this had none.  It is totally loose.  Defeats the purpose if I should go in the water.  I gave 3 starts bcos quality seemed good and it was a pretty pattern.  Underwire was a bit tight, but it is a flattering cut at the neckline, so some may like this."
3.0,The gloves were pretty good but a hole developed on the thumb after first use. The company sent me another pair quickly with no questions asked. I used them twice and a hole developed in the middle finger of the same hand. The left hands are great though.
3.0,Runs small. Afraid to put it in the dryer. Wish size was better but I like everything else about it. I usually wear an XL but this was tight thru the chest.
3.0,The paint was kinda blotchy on a couple of petals but unless you were looking for details you wouldn't notice.
3.0,They are cute but actually quite see through. I would have returned them but I went out of town the day they arrived. The fit was a bit snug even after sizing up.
3.0,This is cute.  Got for my daughter to wear to work.
3.0,Wish these had front pockets
3.0,Usually get a small in joggers or leggings but ordered the medium according to size chart. I'm only 5'2 but the crotch area was too short and of course the length way too long.  The fabric itself was very nice but had to return.
3.0,It has a good soft water resistant feel and comes with filters but it's very thin and moves alot when you breathe compared to another similar thicker one I have
3.0,"It is light, and cheaply made as expected considering the price."
3.0,These undies felt thin and inexpensive.
3.0,I ended up giving these away.
3.0,"Darling dress, but definitely for the waif-thin.  If you have any kind of bosom or curves, forget it.  Also, it's pretty flimsy."
3.0,Waaaaay off on the sizing. I measured my calf before ordering and ordered the correct size. I couldn't get them past my ankle. Way too tight. Have requested a refund.
3.0,Bought 2 sizes bigger but still was too small looked beautiful but definitely not what I was hoping for
3.0,Not meant for large chested women. Not having chevron pattern extend to top looks weird on. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"Cute but colors are much more muted in pep rain. Also runs on the large side. Size down. I am 5’4” with 36DD bust, athletic/muscular build, 188 pounds. I normally wear a large and wish I would have ordered a medium."
3.0,"Loved the design, didn’t look good on me. I’m a size 12 with DD’s. Little support for those puppies so had to return:("
3.0,I really like the style but unfortunately the shoulder strap ripped off the side of the bag after only one week of use<br />Very disappointed  I want to send it back
3.0,Not slouchy enough
3.0,The band on Amazon showed the easy to install type and the one I received was not.
3.0,"Super cute, but gave me a rash, so I am returning this."
3.0,"I have to remember, you got what you pay for... this was not expensive :)"
3.0,"The inflexible cuff is a problem. Winter rain. I wear a rain proof shell. Because of the cuff, I won't be able to keep the water out of the gloves. Bad engineering. They are warm, tho. Disappointing.🐈‍⬛"
3.0,as soon as i opened the package i noticed that one of the leaves was broken.  its still looks ok though..
3.0,Cheap quality.  Holes formed after two wears.
3.0,"UPDATE:  The second XL jacket arrived and proved to an actual XL.  This jacket fits like a size 43, in other words, it fits as though it is between a M and a L.  Since that is what I want, I will be keeping this one.  If you need a REAL size XL jacket, I don't know what to say to you other than &#34;Good Luck!&#34;<br /><br />Other reviewers are correct:  the jackets are very small.  I'm 5' 11&#34;, 190, 36&#34; waist, 43&#34; chest.  Most of my clothes that are sized S, M, L, etc, are Mediums; Large shirts/sweaters are usually baggy on me.  I wear a 16 1/2&#34; x 33&#34; long-sleeve dress shirt.  Last month, I purchased a Joseph A. Banks $650 suit, and the off-the-rack size 43&#34; coat fits me perfectly, as though tailored.  Using my measurements on the web page for the jacket, I was at the M/L juncture, so I ordered the Large.  The arms were snug but tolerable, the length was close to right, but maybe a touch short.  The chest however was WAY small, comparable I would say to about a size 38 jacket.  It wouldn't come any closer than about 3&#34; of buttoning, and that was max effort.  Relaxed, ordinary button attempt came up about 6&#34; short.  So it goes back to swap for an XL and we'll see how that does.<br /><br />Structural review:  Leather is light, probably goat or kidd; mine is black, has the appearance of &#34;crushed&#34; leather rather than smooth.  In fact from a few feet away, it almost looks like velvet.  It is lined with a silk-like liner, probably a rayon blend, also black.  The jacket has one button.  Stitching appears fine.<br /><br />Pockets:  The outer breast pocket is a real pocket.  All of them are; no fake pockets.  However that breast pocket is all of about 3&#34; deep.  The two side pockets are of a normal, useful size/depth.  There is only a single inner pocket.  It's a normal size for phone, wallet or glasses.<br /><br />If the XL size fits, I'll keep the jacket."
3.0,Very fast fashion and a bit wide. Top is cute! Bottom feels quite cheap with its elastic waistband and cut.
3.0,"If you're looking for an itty bitty charm for a bracelet, it's fine. Too small for a pendant, though."
3.0,after many washing become different
3.0,My second day to wear they ripped by the zipper
3.0,"I thought the lanyard and small bag came with it, I just received the eco bag itself. Other than that it’s a nice bag"
3.0,I typically wear a small but ordered a med based on reviews. Still too small
3.0,"These are fair quality for the price, comfortable, look decent. My big complaint is the drawstring is SHORT and I had to tie knots in the ends to keep them form going into the waist band and disappearing. Then they just stabbed my waist non stop so I gave up and untied th string ends and let the string go into the waist. It's weird not having a drawstring but they're nice other than that."
3.0,Seems to work just fine.
3.0,The fabric is not very comfortable.  It works for working out but wish I could wear all day.  I would go up in size next time.  It fits tight.
3.0,Not a fan of the fabric used.  It is constantly covered in lint and hair from the wash!
3.0,I like the pice bud the size is to small.  I always buy 6 rings for my wife and I don't have any problem with yours feel like #5
3.0,This is an acceptable and inexpensive item.  The fabric is patterned so I should have known the chances of having the pattern mismatched were great.  Never did I think they’d get it so wrong to have the birds upside down on the top and right side up on the pants!  Funny.  Lesson learned.
3.0,I returned this product 3 weeks ago and have still not received my refund.  Please advise. It was nice but didn’t like the small handles.
3.0,"the knit of sweater was very nice, but the attached hood has no way todraw it around baby face to keep it on its head.  and no size on it at all.no instruction about attaching faux fur either. as saying goes you get what you pay for. ang gillham"
3.0,Like this just not sure where I can wear it to and what shoes. :)
3.0,They are okay. Something about the look of them on looks odd. Maybe the huge pockets. I will still wear them though because they are comfy!
3.0,Loved the item. Great quality and graphic. If you have a small face this will be too large.
3.0,The pants leg was too short.
3.0,"It fit just fine. However, the sleeves are loose (unfitted). Would be much more reasonable to have elastic in the sleeves for biking."
3.0,More gray than cream in person
3.0,They bend very easily.Looks good but made of cheap quality material
3.0,The watch face scratches very easily and it just looks cheap. It works as expected.
3.0,"looks just like the picture, runs super small."
3.0,"Very pretty, and my daughter loves it.  It's not very thick so I worry about the colder months that are coming, and the zipper always feels like it's going to jam (though it hasn't as of yet), but I paid $25 for it.  I couldn't really ask for better quality at that price."
3.0,"These pant are really nice and comfy, but pilled right after the first wear and wash in the thigh area."
3.0,"Not the best on the market. Sound is good but low quality material. Hat is very snug, needs to be a bit bigger"
3.0,"My fiancé loves the sweater, but it came in the wrong color. I ordered a pink sweater and I got a grey sweater. It was to close to Christmas to return it, so I had to give her the grey one."
3.0,"Ive had this for weeks almost months and it’s still in perfect condition, only thing wrong is that it does turn your fingers green, but I can just wash that off, and at the finger beads the white string sticks out a little, But you can trim it down with nail clippers. Overall worth jt"
3.0,I returned colors were “louder” Than I liked and it ran big
3.0,Ordered the wrong size...
3.0,"Pro - The style is nice and slim how I like it. Cutouts are aligned nice. The Buttons are a little hard to push, which is a pro because when its in my pocket I dont turn the screen on.<br />Con - Slippery, Not enough grip to my liking."
3.0,The lens is easy on the eyes. The glasses themselves pinch the head a bit but I also have a large head. The jury is still out but for now I am satisfied.
3.0,Runs small. I ordered a 9 sizes as an 8
3.0,I like the jacket over all but the color is kinda purple-ish which I don’t like because I purchased this jacket for my son.
3.0,"I purchased these earrings bc of the stainless steel posts. These earrings give a great presence and bc I am highly allergic to metals, they do cause me itching and irritation so I no longer wear them."
3.0,I was very disappointed that stones were missing upon arrival
3.0,Thicker fabric than I expected. Not very breathable. Well constructed and smaller than expected.
3.0,It's a bit shallow and doesn't feel like it is snugly down on my head. I am also not a fan of the radical curve on the brim. It interferes with vision it times.
3.0,It is comfortable but wished that it fitted snug on the face...feels too big for me
3.0,"It's just okay. Not very good quality material, already looks faded after one wash and is thinner than I thought. Extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, so I give it an average rating."
3.0,"My Fiance bought me these for christmas and they are nice, they are thicker and seem to be well stitched. on a cold winter morning (25 degrees ) they don't keep me as warm as I would like the wind goes through them. also they are small. I can barely fit into them and they have no stretch. Thank you"
3.0,This mask is way too large and has no shape. We will have to use chip clips in the back to tighten up the mask and purchase a hooded robe to hide them. The face is pretty cool though...we cut a hole in the mouth so my husband could breathe.
3.0,"I thought the face would be bigger than it is.  I still think it is a okay watch though.  For the price it is a good deal.  The ban is very good quality, nevertheless, I still replaced it it another ban which made the watch look better."
3.0,Cute but they hurt my ears after wearing them at work all day.
3.0,I really love this necklace... the only problem is that the black tends to fade a bit revealing the white puka shell underneath.
3.0,"The shoe was exactly what I was looking for.  They are pretty and the fit was great when we received the shoes. But, when they were worn for the first time, the Velcro strap on one of the shoes wouldn't stay attached and the shoe kept coming off.  Disappointing..."
3.0,It's a great band if it fit me... I must have missed that it was listed as a women's large... I'll wear it till it wears out
3.0,Ok but long
3.0,"My granddaughter loves this dress and finds it comfortable. I however am displeased with the fabric, it is like a cheap taudry nightgown. My granddaughter loves it and that's what counts."
3.0,"UPDATE: Dropped down to 3 stars cause the fabric misalignment really makes the romper look weird on. So, sadly returning. Still cute and comfy if you're ok with the mismatch in the pattern.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bought it for my niece. She's not really into the frilly flowery stuff, but she really liked the way this looked in the photos online. It arrived and it's light material. A bit thin and see-through. Definitely want to wear nude or matching under garments. There's enough elasticity at the top so it doesn't slide down. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is cause the fabric isn't sewn to match up. At the seam at the front and the back, the print isn't aligned. Ordered the white for her. Will probably order the pink for myself!"
3.0,"First off they are as shiny (if not more so) as you see online. I've gotten this style of earring before from another vendor on Amazon and I already knew that the size for this style was going to be the same. To me they are very convenient to put on or take off. I prefer these to wearing studs. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that on of the silver pair wouldn't close, and at that price I'm not going to bother with a return. I really do love how all the colors look. Even with the small problem on the one earring I would buy again from this company. Sorry IF the images are rotated the wrong way, Amazon's uploader seems to have done that.<br /><br />EDIT: after having these on I realized they are really heavy for my ears. It might just be me, I gave these away to my Mom (of all people) She didn't mind the weight."
3.0,Ok...don't expect high quality for the price.
3.0,This was a nice dress but it was a little tight around my chest. The material wasn't very stretchy so I felt a little squished. I got it for senior prom and it was a nice price for a one-time use dress. It was the perfect length for me being 5'4''.
3.0,"Poor quality, high price for 1 pair of boxers"
3.0,"I’m a tall woman at 5’10” so for me to say something is too long is crazy but I will not be wearing this in public. I will, however, wear it around my house."
3.0,"Looks good but don't trust all the small parts to stay together .. Hasn't given me a reason for mistrust, just a feeling."
3.0,pretty but the fabric is not too silky - would have liked a smoother fabric
3.0,"The design of the dress is nice. However, the picture is way off. It fits shorter than in the pic ..and the material is &#34;washed-out&#34; looking."
3.0,I ordered this black bag. My laptop does not fit in the most padded section but it fits in the middle section which is a bit disappointing but the bag is very nice and very light weight. I liked it so much I bought another one. It also shipped and arrived fast.
3.0,"Has underwire, but no reinforced support in the back so it isn't really that supportive. More fabric than necessary in the back makes for an odd sort of a cape...  Front is flattering at the waist. If you have fair skin that tends to turn red (such as in a hot tub), you might want to stay away from the blue and lilac one- that lilac didn't really flatter my skin tone once I cooked a little- oops!"
3.0,Thought I was buying Vionix. No useful support for my feet. Will not make thus mistake again.
3.0,It's too large and the Velcro is not long enough to wrap around to your neck/head.
3.0,Was not impressed as material felt cheap and seams tore easily. Size was very small.
3.0,This was a good purchase overall. I usually buy Michael Kors and Coach watches but wanted to add a different brand and look to my collection.
3.0,"I like the suit but there is no lining on the back side, there is a lining on the front of the suit, so if it fits a little snug on the rear, it is almost too revealing too much.  Otherwise fine, I would wear this at home but not out in public."
3.0,I ordered these as a gift for a friend. They say they are a 2 pack. However when he received them there was only the grey pair. Rated 3 out of 5 simply for the missing pair. He likes the pair he did receive.
3.0,"I order a lot of cardigans and kimono type clothes. I found this to have slightly tight sleeves by the time you put it on over another shirt and the material is so thin that it shows the color or print of whatever you are wearing underneath it. The fit other than that seems right on. I had some loose threads around the edges too. For the price, I'm not disappointed enough to send it back but I was hoping the fabric would be a little thicker. It is definitely white white and not creamy."
3.0,I wish they stayed close better.
3.0,"This dress is really cute! However, the material is really thin, therefore, it clings in all the wrong places. I would order a size up. I'm 5'4, 150lbs and i'm usually a med. but would need a large in this, simply because I like these dresses more loose and flowy."
3.0,I love that it was soft but runs small not only that but the thread was already coming apart n Made a hole just trying it on
3.0,"These are pretty comfortable but the stretchy strap doesn't keep the shoe straight. When I walk it tends to slide to one side which is super annoying. All the decorative stuff is hot glued on, how cheap, doesn't last. Super cute, but won't be buying these ever again."
3.0,"The top was OK quality, but I hate to iron and it came out of the dryer needing ironing!"
3.0,It came all folded up so I am lowering the rating as the fold creases wont come out. Its a felt hat so you cant just wash it and get the creases out.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in this purchase, bc in the bust area the sides are loose and makes for a weird fit on top. And it hangs awkward on the hips (for those women with hips). I really like it but I'm not in love with it. It is also a tad see-through."
3.0,Nice shirt. I like the material. I ordered an XXL and it fits like a S. Way off on their sizes.
3.0,It is okay.  Haven't worn it yet but it appears to be an ok item.
3.0,When you go to lock the earing it is not as secure as one my think.  I love the earing it hugs my ears and without any difficulity it looks amazing.
3.0,"The glasses looked nice, the packaging was great, and I loved the little kit that came with it. That being said, there were some downsides. One of the hinges started messing up about a week after I got them; the flex hinge wouldn't go back in all the way. The ear rests were uncomfortable and, after wearing them for a while, caused small amounts of pain where the ear meets the head. Finally, about a week after the hinge started acting up (two weeks after I received them) the glasses fell from my head to my carpeted floor, and the leg with the messed up hinge broke completely off. Overall, if the glasses hadn't been so cheap, this review would be much worse. I was very impressed by the carrying bag, cleaning cloth, repair kit, and coupon I received with the glasses, though, and that is why I give this 3 stars. I will probably buy from SUNGAIT again, but I will not order this product."
3.0,The torso was too short. The top fit well but the bottoms rode up.
3.0,"Son bonito pero no muy buena calidad,  no le duraron mucho, se hicieron feos por dentro"
3.0,"Ordered XL, fits more like a medium, little snug, but pretty"
3.0,One pair came ripped at the crotch but other than that super cute
3.0,Okay ripped after 2 months
3.0,"Although I am very familiar with the Loungefly brand and own several of them, this bag was smaller across the top end and slightly smaller in height than my other bags. I find that I dislike the design with the protruding zipper compartment on the front. The compartment is too small to be useful for anything other than keys, small change, or mabe tissues, or lip balm. Because of the compartment; I assume; the main opening doesn't seem to open as far as necessary to easily access the items you'd have inside. Now, I know why Loungefly made the matching wallet so small. This bag doesn't hold a regular sized woman's wallet, unless you stand it on end. I do love the colors and print, but I'm very conflicted about whether to return this bag. It's very expensive to have these design flaws."
3.0,Too small. I order size S (10 - 12) but on the item is S (10 - 11)
3.0,"This material was much thinner than i wanted and expected! Not very happy and returned it, if it was thicker instead of cheap and thin it would be perfect!"
3.0,"It fits as expected, but I could see my underwear throught it."
3.0,"Material very thin, bought as a gift"
3.0,"I bought two wallets from Amazon, this one and a slim wallet.  This wallet holds a lot, about 14 cards, ID, receipts, and cash.  It also has three zipper pockets that can hold your keys, coins and whatever else you want to secure.  The construction isn't the best, and it seems to have cheap zippers.  The zipper will catch on the inside material and won't zip all the way.  This won't fit comfortably in your front or back pocket, with it fully loaded.  If you're looking for a large capacity wallet to stuff in your backpack or briefcase, this will work fine.  Otherwise I suggest you look for something else.<br />  ."
3.0,I was disappointed at the packaging. But when I opened it up it only got worse. They were dirty. They run a bit small. So get a size up. Tight waist band. Once they were all clean they were ok. So that's why I'm going with 3 🌟🌟🌟's.
3.0,"The quality and design are great but the size runs very small, I am a size large and I ordered an x-large but could not button around my chest area. The length and everything else was perfect though."
3.0,"The shoes look very nice and the color along with the lower price persuaded my purchase, but shoes are not comfortable.<br />Shoes seem to be made very well with good quality suade leather but they have some sort of stiff plastic under the suade in the toe box and the heel which is very stiff and hurts my feet. If they would have left the stiff plastic out and just left the suade i am sure they would break in nicely. As other reviewers have said the soles are very heavy and not as soft as other timberland oxfords i have owned in the past, so heavy they actually feel like your wearing stell toe work shoes.<br />Bummed about the uncomfortableness because the color and looks were great. Oh i got the green olive color."
3.0,"The dress is really pretty! I'm 178 lbs. and 5'7 so I ordered a 2xl based on reviews. The dress fit, but is so short that it barely reaches my ankles. So if your tall it will not be a floor length dress. Also the top is kinda thin so a tank top will have to be worn underneath. Hopefully it will still look okay for our family pictures."
3.0,Beautiful swimsuit but the torso was too short. My boobs kept  trying to pop out and the straps kept coming off.
3.0,good  for the money
3.0,Look good so far but I can tell that the black paint will only say on for so long I could see the sliver on one oil f the earrings so they will probably be sliver  when its it's all bc said and done
3.0,"Love the style, color and fit but can’t wear sleeveless tops or camisoles under it because the fabric is course and very itchy next to the skin."
3.0,"Beautiful, but too small.  I will have to return it."
3.0,Wasn’t what I expected in size!
3.0,Colors not as shown.
3.0,"Really beautiful for a good price. I have received a lot of compliments. My pair is really hair to close and can be uncomfortable getting in and out of my ears, though."
3.0,"they are cheap necklaces but I do like them for the price. my only complaint was one had broken before I even wore it, but it is what it is."
3.0,As a gift for a childs birthday to match her bathing suit.
3.0,"Material is pretty thin, the white is very see through.  Good for the price though.  I would order up at least one size though as they seem to run quite small."
3.0,Good material but top was too big and bottom a size too small.
3.0,"I bought this one in particular (out of other similar ones available on amazon) because I thought it didn't have the middle chain part that goes down a middle part, it DOES. All the pictures look like it's just the hippy headband piece but nope.<br /><br />Simple fix with some needle nose pliers, but annoying that I spent the time looking for one that didn't just for this to show up with it. and the picture shown definitely don't have it on there.<br /><br />nice quality for costume jewelry, all links are well connected and it lays nicely on my head with little effort getting the chains to hang as they should."
3.0,My son has worn them three times and they are snagged and the toe is worn down. It is a good price though and even though they might not last as long as I expected I think I'd order them again.
3.0,"Fits true to size, but the  neck line looks frayed, does not keep its shape. The dress looks better on the picture than in real life."
3.0,"Frames are white but are turning brown in weird areas, and not from wear. They fit my 7 year olds head perfectly though."
3.0,"I ordered this jacket in a size 14 as I read people's reviews saying the jacket runs small.  Size 14 equivocates to an XXL, which is what the label on the jacket says.  The arms are about an inch short when I extend my arms out.  Love the look and feel of the jacket tho."
3.0,"Very cute, but very tight through the shoulders. Perfect for those who are on the petite/slim size. If you are size 10-12 this will be snug to the point of being not comfortable."
3.0,"Looks as pictured, so no need for me to add photo. It simply didn’t look flattering on my head. It’s too big."
3.0,Wanted this for my wedding but without the bow it is plain.
3.0,Did not like this very much. The wires kept poking my skin and left horrible marks
3.0,Small fit. Fits almost like a mechanic beanie feather than a stylish beanie. Still a great look.
3.0,wish i had tried this on him before washing but its too small now i can't return because i washed it :S
3.0,The fur is not nice- I removed it.  I added more rhinestones where the fur strips were.<br />The strap broke before the night was over my costume was incomplete for half of the evening. It's a cheap mask cheap- just have glue around if you plan to wear it for more than an hour or 2.
3.0,The material is kinda stiff even after I washed it.
3.0,"Too difficult to get zipped up while it's on...I have to zip it up and then put it on, which sort of defeats the purpose."
3.0,They are super cute and look just like the photo but one of the stones fell off when I opened the package.
3.0,"Not the highest quality gloves, and yes, the poor neglected thumb hangs out, but these are the ONLY gloves that my 2 yr old will not yank off."
3.0,The right size but the quality of the cap was just okay
3.0,I lost it anyways
3.0,"was good for a last minute costume piece, but the fit was pretty awkward. was too loose around my waist, but fit fine otherwise according to the listed measurements. To be fair I am pretty tall 5'11 and have a small waist so in general it is hard to find decent fitting pants."
3.0,Not sure why this would be under kids jewelry??
3.0,"They are cute. I love the little lady bug, but there HUGE! Clearly I did not read the dimensions. Maybe a small brooch but way to large for my small head as earrings."
3.0,Comfortable but not very stylish
3.0,Ordered a size up per peoples suggestion - too big and wasn't as cute in real life - returned.
3.0,"So product quality seems fine my issue is the size, they are too wide for my wife and too narrow for me, will be having to make a return this this time.."
3.0,I would perfect hooking in front not back.<br />But never the less .<br />Apron is long will keep you dry..
3.0,Two of them are nice but one has a very weird cut under the arms. It looks pretty ridiculous. I do like the other ones though.
3.0,The hasp is so small it's hard to put on by yourself
3.0,I love the dress. Very beautiful. The overall fit good but I was disappointed with the extra fabric under the arm. Very things else looks and fit great except for that.
3.0,"When a manufacturer provides a sizing chart, you wouldn’t expect getting a shirt with the right fit to be difficult. But for that to be true, the sizing chart needs to make sense, and this one doesn’t. The line representing the chest is shorter than the one for the shoulder in the picture. And yet, in the table, the numbers for the chest are bigger than those for the shoulder.<br /><br />I ended up ordering the Large, as the sleeve length was more than adequate, the shoulder measurement was close, and the chest measurement was larger than I needed, but I could live with a little extra room. And besides, I usually wear a Large, which generally fits comfortably. What I received was slightly short in the sleeves and quite snug around the chest and shoulders. Hopefully, it won’t shrink when it’s washed, because it’s nearly too small now. So, my advice – if you are at all close to the top of a size, go up one for a more comfortable fit.<br /><br />As to the question of whether it will be wearable after being laundered, that would depend on the fabric. Unfortunately, what the shirt is made of is a mystery. The description says cotton and soft, so I was thinking something like a cotton T-shirt. It isn’t. It’s much thicker and stiffer. And to add to the confusion, the tag on the garment says 100% rayon. If that’s true, it helps explain the care instructions, which say “hanging and drying,” as rayon shrinks considerably in the dryer.<br /><br />These inconsistencies and unknowns are unfortunate, as the shirt seems well constructed and I’m a fan of the style. Hopefully, the manufacturer will correct some of them soon."
3.0,"I previously purchased one that was much larger, and for the same cost. I was hoping to replace with this new one because the other got lost. I got the pendant and it was So tiny!!"
3.0,Top is nice but no bottoms were sent with it even though it was described as a 2 piece set..
3.0,Work ok for the price.
3.0,Se marca mucho la parte de adelante.
3.0,its cute but super tight and you can’t adjust it
3.0,"Will hold arrows, but is super flimsy and cheap feeling.<br />Buy the Easton or Goldtip product, much sturdier."
3.0,"these are really well made, but they're not padded enough for me. They're difficult to remove from sweaty hands."
3.0,"The necklace that came with this is totally plastic, but I do get a lot of compliments on it. Shirt itself is a thin fabric and runs a little small So it really doesn't look nice."
3.0,Material is very stiff and which makes the design flow less than ideal.
3.0,"I followed the size chart and got a medium. I should have gotten a small, I’m swimming in this sweatshirt. :-)"
3.0,"This dress is so cute and it’s so pretty on ,  The arms are a little tight tho.  I wish they weren’t because I would wear more often !"
3.0,These don't work for everyone. For some reason some ears just won't work. They were great party favors. Great ice breaker
3.0,"Very pretty, but fits small. Had to return due to size"
3.0,"have been using Speidel bands for 50 years, this one I would not purchase again. The band is not wide enough for my Apple I phone12 watch."
3.0,It was a gift. The person receiving was happy.
3.0,"I bought this set because I really liked the burgundy scarf. I didn’t actually like the other one but I was more expensive to buy it by itself. When I received them I was disappointed because the colors look very different from the picture. The burgundy looking one looks just like rust and the multi-colored one doesn’t have orange it’s that same weird rust color. I kept them just because I didn’t want to deal with the hassle of returning them. Also it’s a really nice warm, large, infinity scarf which is what I like. I just wish it was burgundy like it is displayed."
3.0,"Cute design, but runs one size smaller than stated."
3.0,"Ordered these gloves for fall/ early winter. Looks decent, however didn’t find it warm enough for the weather."
3.0,"Good for the price, a little smaller than expected. Great color choices but definitely could’ve had longer threads for the tops. I’ve had two fall out while wearing but again for price I’m not upset."
3.0,"I wish I could give 5 stars as I do love the shirt. I have two others like it but some issues with this one. First, it's light blue purple and black, not white. Secondly, after just one wear the sleeve ends are falling apart. I'll fix them myself but disappointed."
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in the pin backing.  Not sure if I missed it in the description, but the two pins instead of one long locking pin makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear on clothing next to my skin.  I can only wear it on an outer sweater or jacket.  Otherwise it's cute."
3.0,The first thing I noticed was it is a very flimsy dress. The fabric was not sewn correctly at the waist so a bulge is created and the fabric “pops” up like a bubble. I ordered a medium I am a size 10/12. The wrap (bottom half of dress) was a little small and didn’t over lap enough. The top part fit but if I sized up probably would be too big. I will be returning.
3.0,"What I liked is that the company was very responsive to my concerns about being able to create the perfect thumbprint keychain for me—my father passed away and I wanted to give all the family’s grandchildren this special Keepsake. Before I ordered it, they assured me it could be done. Then I ordered 8 of them. However, the keychain featured on the website/amazon is black print, bit it came in definite BROWN. This was eclipsed by the fact that the print wipes off!  The keychain comes with a polish square. A certain amount of pressure is needed for polishing—minimal pressure. When I polished it, it definitely came off.  When I contacted the company, they stated that this does happen...WHAT?  I purchased 8 keychains at $150 +!  This is unacceptable and I do not know how I will be able to give these as gifts—they are utterly unusable. What do I tell the recipients—“they are just for show, so don’t use them?”  This was a big disappointment.<br />***IMPORTANT UPDATE to my previous review—this company did contact me, offer to give me a 10% refund and to replace any keychains that the were not holding up. I appreciate them trying to make good on an order gone bad. I am changing my rating from 1 Star to 3 Stars."
3.0,The material is so soft and nice but the bottoms were not flattering on me and the top was SUPER tight I would say the top definitely runs small.
3.0,A bit too short
3.0,I ordered an xl because reviews said it runs very small and that is the truth it is small. But the fabric is awesome and it's nice and heavy!
3.0,I do not like the shorts. They look so nice and posh in the ad. When I received the belt wasn't attached and doesn't even have belt loops. The material is thin and has big creases in it. I was not please.
3.0,"the item is smaller than the sizing description that is given.  otherwise, this is beautiful"
3.0,I like the yellow  dress but it does not feel like the striped one that I have. It’s rough and does not flow as nice.
3.0,Just an OK sports bra.
3.0,I would have kept this shirt if there wasn't a stain on the front of it.
3.0,beautiful but should of bought a small or extra small.
3.0,Does helpnwith the glare but I don't like how yellow it makes everything.
3.0,It is cheap so I guess I shouldn’t be surprised but I’ve bought similar before and been happier.
3.0,It didn't fit me as expected
3.0,Quality and consistency a bit lacking. Does the job alright
3.0,"I bought the blue bag - I like the interior compartments, helps keep my things organized. Often my bag serves as my purse and my diaper bag, so it's super helpful to be organized. The inside side pockets are too shallow to hold my phone or sunglasses, so don't really use them. I don't like that the fabric by the zipper is a different color than the body of the bag, looks tacky and cheap."
3.0,This material wasn't what I was expected and it fit a little slimmer than most shirts. I normally wear mediums and a large was tight on me.
3.0,"This romper is extremely cute and sexy for a night out but the chest are is WIDE. You must get it tailored in order to wear it. Other than that, the fit was great."
3.0,"I loved this dress so much more than I thought it would. I would give it a higher rating, however the first time I wore it, the skirt ripped. The material is not the best, but only after wearing it for about 3 hours I noticed a rip in the skirt. So comfortable, a shame the material is so thin and will rip easily."
3.0,Fabric faded after 1-2 washes. Looks terrible. Will not be buying again. Fit is on the larger side. Great for long hair.
3.0,"I bought this as a last-minute Cheshire Cat Halloween costume. The headband fit fine, but the tail was cumbersome--there was no easy way to wear it without an extra piece to attach it (like a safety pin). I feel like if it had come with a cute pink belt to wear the tail on, it would've worked better. (Or maybe if the loop at the end of the tail closed with a snap or button to make it easier to open and attach to belt loops.) Overall it was an OK purchase and will work in a pinch of you need a quick costume."
3.0,"It hurts my head, after a few minutes, where the pressure points on the back hold the hat on your head."
3.0,"It’s a cute shoe. I could see that it would be comfortable, but I ordered size 6 and it was like a size 7. I wore them one day, and rubbed a red mark on the top of my foot trying to keep them on. The 3 stars is because I liked the style. But, no worries; Amazon is easy about returning and refunding. Get the shoe. Just know the sizing is much bigger."
3.0,This is not heavy weight cotton. It's too thin.
3.0,"came in long sleeved, not as pictured, but I get a lot of compliments"
3.0,"Would I say this is the best shirt stay? Probably not but for the price it's ok. It hasn't broken yet and does what it's suppose to do. It isn't noticeable under my pants and I wear straight leg. The only issue I have with it, which may not be applicable to everyone, is when I walk with my suit case the tabs to adjust the length catches on the edge causing it to loosen the stay. If that tab was thinner or more flush, then I'd probably give it a 4 star rating.<br /><br />If you're looking into a shirt stay but don't want to spend 30$ on a more stylish design, this is the way to go. If you find yourself not a fan of shirt stays, then you're not out that much cash."
3.0,"The band itself looks nice, but the tool to remove links breaks fairly easy. The finish scratches easily, and one of the links will not hold in the pin. I was expecting an easier time adjusting this band especially at this price."
3.0,nice but wrong size
3.0,I bought a large because I normally wear a small but I needed an extra large.  Nice pattern.  Thin material.  Nice length.
3.0,I really like the style and idea of these shorts. But what I didn't like was the tights were to loose so the pocket portion for the cell phone kept swinging back and forth. Even when I got a smaller size the tights were still loose.
3.0,black is better for me
3.0,Very light weight but it is nice
3.0,"I buy these mask often to have a variety of colors But today I received it in the mail once I opened it the mask wasn't even in the pouch it was on the outside of the pouch So I check the pouch it was open so I don't know if it is a used mask or not but looking over the mask it looks new and no defects I ended up washing it in hot water and add softener I just don't want the hassle of returns,"
3.0,I usually wear a medium so I ordered a medium I should have ordered a small in this blouse
3.0,Too thin for my taste.  But fit was good.
3.0,Good quality for the money. Just wish it was a little larger
3.0,Was a little smaller then my key.
3.0,I would have given this a five star but they advertise this holds a check book but it really doesn't
3.0,"A bit snug, sleeves are a bit long, but nice fabric, and colors are pretty close to the picture."
3.0,You get what you pay for. The dress is very cute on the hanger. The top of the dress was large and the shape was off.
3.0,Very comfortable I just wore them with a tank top on my trip to Myrtle beach I am gonna order more for the summer months in MI.
3.0,it is for a stocking stuffer  for Christmas
3.0,I ordered a niece one but was sent a sister one but still very beautiful piece. Cute little keepsake
3.0,It’s colorful but too Biggy
3.0,I am an XS but the smallest size they had was a small. I read other reviews that said to wear with a belt. Even with a belt it is way too big and too long for my liking. But very gorgeous dress!!
3.0,Very nice hat. Seemed to be good quality. But definitely not for a person with a larger head. Wouldn't fit me at all.
3.0,"This is a tough and durable watch. However, the face is extraordinary small. I can't read it without my glasses and my eyes aren't horrible. My daughter makes fun of my for ""my tiny watch"""
3.0,They are cute but I clicked on Big Kids and got Toddlers.  I am trying to give then away as a Christmas gift.
3.0,"Nice in appearance but very hard to keep balanced on the head.  The fan worked properly to inflate. But instructions were a bit hard to grasp, although in the end, I got it right."
3.0,"Cool bluetooth beanie, works like it's suppose to.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good sound<br />Bluetooth<br />Good color<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't fit well<br />Bulky around the speaker"
3.0,"I bought this outfit for my son because I thought it looked adorable online. The outfit looks identical to the seller's picture. It is a bit thin, in my opinion, and it is a small fit. He is a long baby (75% range) but has never not fit in the clothing for his size. In this outfit, the bottom remained pulled open, revealing his diaper all day. Overall, I liked the outfit, but because of the size, he could only wear it once, which was disappointing."
3.0,"I often recommend this to people with poor posture. I decided to use this on myself since lately I have been sitting more and not paying attention to my own posture. Unfortunately, I have gained a few pounds and attempting to put on a XXL was akin to an adult attempting to put on a t-shirt from elementary school. Needless to say I had to return the product but would recommend to those who can actually fit into one"
3.0,"Love the color, fit, and style. However I have tried three of these shirts and The second to bottom snap is always defective."
3.0,Didn't work for my Gshock gravitymaster but it will probably work for your watch
3.0,You get what you expect from a cheap pair of sunglasses
3.0,"I guess it is true that you pay for what you get; in this case I went by the other reviews and was slightly misled.  I believe the lenses in these glasses are just fine but the frames are very flimsy and easily move around when you touch them.  Overall, they look and feel like &#34;cheap&#34; glasses is the bottom line.  In addition, don't make the same mistake that I made by ordering a prescription because of some calculation or chart online.  With my contacts for distance this Rx works well, however, without my distance vision the Rx was all wrong, and it's not that I needed a stronger lens but I guess in order to see the computer clearly I need to correct both my distance and near vision which I had no idea about and just thought that since I can see relatively clearly very up close without my contacts that I would just need a &#34;weak&#34; Rx for reading glasses.  That was not the case so try not to make the same mistake that I did."
3.0,"Really pretty. Light material and a good length for covering your belly. However, it is really thin material and you can see every flaw or unsightly pudgy mounds you are trying to hide. I would suggest buying a size up for the next customer."
3.0,Even though the color was not what I wanted the dress is still cute and I opted to keep it. I arrived at the early end of the span quoted and is very comfortable.
3.0,They are nice but it was missing the gray pair.
3.0,Not as expected<br />Gave to goodwill
3.0,I wanted to use it as a nose ring. There was a stray wire in the part that clasps and it scratched me on my nose.  I started a return and was given a full refund. I do not have to send back the product. Customer service was very prompt. I’ve bought other silver jewelry from this seller and have no complaints.
3.0,it's very cute but unwrapped the same day I
3.0,"It’s a bathing suit.. it could be better.. I love the adjustable straps, I don’t love the silver metal,  I think it cheapens the suit, the suit also seemed to run short in the torso, I’m not a tall girl 5’4, I don’t usually have this issue, also the color is far off from the one represented ( I understand this is always a possibility, just thought it was worth mentioning). The suit will be fine for the back yard chasing grand babies, but I’ll probably keep looking."
3.0,You would think a trunk on Wheels would come with a handle. To be fair it did not state in the description but just thought it was obvious.
3.0,"These are fine for the money.  I wear a size 6/8 pants and a small fit me.  They feel thin and the material is not as nice as other workout pants and shorts I own.  They do not come up as high, in fact they are a little lower in back than in front.  They are not as smoothing or flattering as other pairs."
3.0,I like the style but is very cheap looking.
3.0,They run small.  I bought two pairs.  One for my 4 year old and one for my 7 year old.  My 4 year old ended up fitting into the ones I got my 7 year old!  So about 2 sizes too small.  My son loves them.  We never use the remote but he can change the colors easily and charge them himself.
3.0,"It's like a fluorescent hot pink. surprised when i saw it. The color isn't that bad, but very different from the screen."
3.0,A little stiff when I got it but a run through the wash fixed that.  Wish it were available in other colors.
3.0,"Frayed. Not very good quality,  but cute"
3.0,"The flower in the picture is more of a beige/creamy color which is more elegant than the actual color, which is more yellower. Otherwise, it's a not bad purchase. I'll mix and match it with my other pendants, necklaces and earrings."
3.0,I'm a size 10 (5'5&#34; and 150lbs).  A bit tight.  Still wearable.  Plan on wearing in winter with leggings.
3.0,This is a bit thick and that is ok. The issue it the bulky seem in the middle.
3.0,The tanks are well made and feel nice. They definitely run small. I think they would fit better on longer torso. But I don't mind it being a little longer.
3.0,"The color is really nice, and I was interested in the idea and intention of the style , but I can't figure out how to wear it. It is not a thick as the pic and there isn't enough material for it to lay like the pic , im not hopeful but I'll keep trying ..."
3.0,"I like this jacket, but it is shiny. I did not notice until I went out the door to work and the sun hit it. LOL!"
3.0,Not the color I was expecting. Way more salmon/coral.
3.0,These are not the same quality as other hue socks I have. They do not stay up very well. Really cute though.
3.0,"good fit, comfortable, simple. They come in a variety of colors but I got white , can never go wrong with the basics. It’s accurate to the listing."
3.0,"I like the bras but I’m a 40 DD  and got the extra extra large according to sizing , they are too big.  Sports bras need to be tighter to keep things from moving too much.. if you get go one size down.."
3.0,It’s ok. A fake knit look. It’s more like a picture of a knit cap
3.0,It’s ok...zipper keeps falling down. Bought a different one from Kohl’s.
3.0,"These came at a great price for the bundle/convenience. Only thing I don't like is that the tunnels are a little slimmer than I expected. Sometimes they sink in, causing pain in my ear, but a quick adjustment fixes it."
3.0,Some of they fit small and some of really big.
3.0,Cute shirt but runs very small! I would order 2 sizes up! It took about a month to arrive.
3.0,Dress came torn at the bottom. Seller promised to refund
3.0,"I bought this as part of a 70s costume and its super cute BUT it kept turning on my neck. Now you can't tell in my pics and it just looks like a leather choker buy it was a little annoying. I really can't say why it kept shifting but it did. Maybe it needed to be tighter but I wasn't willing to literally choke myself. 😕 Very, very cute though, good price and nicely made."
3.0,They are great for the shower but I didn’t realize they are men’s so I won’t be wearing them ! I wanted a pair for the pool!
3.0,Style…dresses up or down. But a little snug across the back with a ladies long sleeve Tee on. But opened front let’s it fit good enough.
3.0,I was shocked as to how short the strap is. I don’t think that I have a large wrist. Can the strap be replaced?
3.0,"Found out these are three times the cost and almost double the weight of others. Hammock Gear has them right now for 4.95. Yes, titanium, exact same size/strength"
3.0,Runs very small and the top part pulls down. My daughter only wore it once while vacationing in Disney world and I had to buy her another one.
3.0,"Bought these for my husband. Size up. The material is as expected, however the fit was a little tight in the waist., and also a wide leg pant."
3.0,"Runs very small, but beautiful skirt."
3.0,So this bathrobe material is very good but the size is off. I ordered a size 2x and it fits like a large/xlarge and not a 2x. I was disappointed but I have it to my sister and it fits her perfectly.
3.0,"I picked these out for a Christmas gift. Cute rings, some were more comfortable to wear than others. It was like the rounded parts that touch the nose were rough and scratchy on some. They irritate my skin and turn it green, but I still wear them for shorter periods of time (until I order quality ones)."
3.0,"I love the colors of these, but they are way too tight for my wrist. I have small wrists! I have to return these because they are so tight they hurt my wrist."
3.0,"The dress is cute and I received several compliments. My only issue here is that the dress came with holes in the pockets that only got worse the more I would put my hands in the pockets. I needed an outfit on the spot so I didn't return it because of this, but you definitely get what you pay for. My husband called it a &#34;disposable dress&#34; because it was cheap (the fabric feels like it might tear easily), perfect for the occasion, but by the end the pockets were useless. It has no tags, so I'm hoping I don't ruin it when I attempt to hand wash it. But again, it's totally cute."
3.0,"I originally bought these for after pregnancy to help getting my shape back. These tank tops are NOT high compression tanks at all. They feel similar to wearing a Nike Dry Fit tank. Though they stretch some and are super comfy, they aren’t really true compression tank tops."
3.0,"These reading glasses worked okay. I think possibly the lens needs to be a bit larger to work great. I feel like I was moving my head up and down to use the correct part of the lens when looking at things other that print. Also I broke them rather quickly (although I am extremely hard on my reading glasses and break them often and am constantly buying new ones).  Since I buy lots of reading glasses, I feel the price - $17.00 is a bit high."
3.0,zippers on the RHS.  Very light weight.
3.0,A little too light with half umbrella on it when a gust of wind comes. Even with a half block of concrete block the whole thing came down
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this watch. I was looking for a reliable analog pocket watch. There were some cheaper but I liked the style of this one. So far it seems to keep decent time.<br /><br />My biggest concerns are that it feels very light in weight as compared to other analog pocket watches I have purchased, so somewhat brings into question to me the quality of materials used. It may be a non-issue but concerning to me.<br /><br />Also the winding mechanism does not give tangible feedback. Every other analog watch I have you can actually feel the spring being wound as you turn the crown. By whatever means this watch is wound it feels virtually like the crown is just freely spinning and not winding anything. However the watch works. This may just be the design, but another difference that struck my which personally I do not like. I like being able to feel the watch winding and know when it is getting tighter.<br /><br />Anyway the watch works so far and these are my observations and experience thus far."
3.0,"Un poco pequeña, me parece que son para niñas de no más de 8 años"
3.0,This is basically a light weight roll top waterproof bag shaped like a backpack with shoulder straps. It is very functional and does keep the contents dry even in pretty wet conditions. The should straps are wide enough to be comfortable. It could be improved if there was a bit of padding on the strap side (side that rests on your back) so that any irregularities in the bag don't irritate your back and the addition of an internal divider or pocket(s) might be helpful for internal organization.
3.0,"I give it a three because the delivery took more than two weeks. When I got it, it was brilliant. I am super gentle with it so the cord won't break and I'm planning to wear it until Cas needs to find God. The pendant itself doesn't seem hollow and has a bit of weight. If you love Supernatural, get it. It is ABSOLUTELY worth your money."
3.0,Gave this 3 stars because the chain clasp broke the 2nd time I wore it.  I wanted to put a different clasp on it anyway because it is very difficult to put on by yourself.  But for $2 it was worth the 10 minutes to took to revamp it because it is so very cute!
3.0,"returned it because it was too big... and i ordered the smallest size they had listed... which is my usual measurements. make sure to size yourself down by 2. its a shame, because this dress is so so cute..."
3.0,"To tell the truth I got this watch when I read about it being the sole reason some people have been held indefinitely in guantanimo. It'sone of the most commonly sold an used watches on the planet and somehow owning it is an indicator of guilt?<br /><br />Anyway... it's a very basic watch, it tells you the date and time, has an alarm, a stopwatch, a backlight... everything you really need. The only thing that makes me ding it down a couple stars is the band size. I'm not an overly large man and I have to wear it on the last hole which is a little fiddly and makes the very end stick out and catch on things. I usually end up just tossing it in my pocket."
3.0,Too clingy mayerial
3.0,Nice product but needs a clasp.
3.0,The bag looks great. But I returned due to bad smell.
3.0,These glasses are great for the beach. Very dark. Too dark to drive with. But classy looking.
3.0,They are not as comfortable as another style I have by this same brand.
3.0,I’m a 36DD and the Large did not fit at all. Quality is sub par.
3.0,The product was delivered in good time. The designs were clear and the color was awesome eight the black and white or the colored ones. My only objection was that the upper arm rolled down. Wished that they held up better.
3.0,Not worth. Cheap
3.0,seam runs down back of skirt
3.0,Wish I had ordered a size up.
3.0,"There will only be a few times this can be worn because it’s only a sweater.  I expected a heavier knit but the price tells the story.<br />Still,it’s cute if the weather permits."
3.0,"This is a nice pair of blue light reducing glasses, but don't be fooled by the pictures. If you experience light haloing at night, these maybe reduce it microscopically.<br />They have a nice sturdy frame and work great for reducing the harshness of the light, but I was disappointed that they had no effect on the haloing, since that was why I bought them. They're nice enough to hold onto, though. I wore them during the day today and they work just as well for day use as the other glasses I have."
3.0,"really cure top, but OMFG, don't expect to breath if you're a 36D. I first bought the medium, which was way too tight across the chest, then I went with the large, which was still tight. They really need to come up with a larger version for anyone with a 36B bust or bigger."
3.0,"When I realized that the zipper on my hardshell luggage was the only thing between security and a disasterous spill, I sought to purchase these baggage straps to secure the contents of case while in transit.  They were easy enough to install and adjust, but after just two round trips, the two belts were no longer attached to each other.  The plastic buckles have survived so far, but I wonder how amenable the TSA inspectors are to removing and reattaching the straps for baggage inspection.  Perhaps they were responsible for the damage, or maybe the machinery was the culprit.  One nice benefit is how they stand out in the luggage carousel when scanning to locate your bag."
3.0,"The garment felt uncomfortable to wear, so maybe better for a different body shape other than mine."
3.0,Thought it would be more form fitting but looked like a box .
3.0,I'm tall and it has a fitted waist which doesn't allow a good fit for me.
3.0,I like the shirt.. light weight material and fits snug but. I ordered XL.. I am 6' 180 lbs. The sleeves are way to short.. ok no biggie I roll them up most of the time. The length is also short. The shirt fits ok and have had compliments on it but it fits like a med/small.  I ordered again but in XXL... will see if it fits
3.0,"I usually wear a size small. After reading the reviews, I sized up. I should have sized up to a large. I wanted it to fit looser around the waist, as it shows on model. Think I’ll be sending this back. I like the style and the weight. It’s also very comfortable."
3.0,Its just like the picture and fits any size
3.0,Not entirely happy with this purchase. The heart keeps flipping up side down and backwards. Won't stay sitting the correct way. But I love the charms.
3.0,"Brighter pink than pictured, but looks nice. Size is small Asian Size, order up for correct fit."
3.0,"These are 16G for sure. I couldn't use them in my nose ring, since that is an 18G at the largest. I did use in my ear cartilage and it was a little difficult to get it to close. They have to be lined up just perfectly and then just the right amount of pressure is needed. I haven't had a problem since putting it in my ear. It is very comfortable and hasn't gotten caught on towels, my hair, or my ear. It hasn't popped open, so it is good once you have it in, but I wouldn't want to change it out a lot due to how difficult to close correctly."
3.0,"The skirt is beautiful, the material seems to be of great quality, but, the color on some of the stripes are faded."
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty and sparkly, however they're super heavy and the backs of them are very ugly. The back is just silver indents. Anyway, you get what you pay for. Not sure if I'll be wearing these for my wedding like I originally planned."
3.0,"Ok.  I really like these earrings.  They are about the size of a dime or so.  Not big.  Colorful but subtle.  The tree is a little difficult to discern - only because it’s small.  Giving it just 3 stars, because......it was on the slowest boat from China.  Took FOREVER to get here.  Don’t order them if you’re in a hurry."
3.0,"Looks a little fragile, keeping it, hoping stones do not fall apart."
3.0,Smelled a little funny when received.  Other than that fit my11 year old perfect and she loved them.
3.0,cute shoes but ordered a 4 and got a 3.
3.0,I bought this in a XL though my partner usually wear l because I figured it may be too small in large. I'm glad I went up a size it fits perfectly with enough room. Quality of fabric not bad. Had a few loose threads and the buttons kept getting stuck in loose threads when unbuttoning. Also there is a ugly lounge of bright red thread used to hem the shirt. My husband lived the shirt but after he started to point out all these flaws I began to feel sorry I bought it.
3.0,I finally wore the black pair today. I planned to wear the white ones but the hoop broke when I was putting them on. The one on the right in the picture.  Its not fixable so I basically have 2 pairs to wear.
3.0,"This was a piece for an Alice madness returns cosplay that I am working on.  It is Huge! The pendent is though, but I recommend using your own chain, the one that comes with it is really rather thin and looks easily breakable."
3.0,love it but the chain is thin
3.0,"Shape wise, the glasses are fine. They cover well and keep the wind from my eyes relatively well. Construction wise the glasses seem to fail a bit. The materials used seems a bit flimsy especially at the hinges. Very thin. It feels like the glasses will break very easily."
3.0,"It's a super cute top, however the elastic waist ruins the effect  it's too short & I'm only 5'4&#34;and  have a short torso..."
3.0,"Size up! Overall, it’s cute, but not exactly what I wanted. The actual hoodie part looks cheap and I wish it fit more loose/long, but it’s a decent little shirt. I wouldn’t buy it again though."
3.0,I even ordered a larger size.
3.0,ok for casual  wear
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but runs really small! I ordered a size up and I still need to return for a bigger one."
3.0,"The bands are nice and comparable to other bands of the same type.  However, these bands are very large and are not well suited for smaller wrists.  The band wraps completely around my wrist making it difficult to put on.  If you don't have small wrists these would be great, but if you do you may want to select another brand."
3.0,"The band itself is nice, however the way it looks in the picture it doesn’t show its magnet. Next time I should read before I buy because magnet was definitely not what I was looking for."
3.0,The bra lost its stick on the outer edges after one use. Felt oversized and kind of just sat on my boobs. Did nothing in the sense of cleavage or lift like I've experienced with Target sticky boobs.
3.0,"It's okay, but wasn't exactly my style."
3.0,these are made for a little girl earrings and with that being said it may work.  sorry was not impressed at all with the size.
3.0,"It fits true to size. It is kind of thin, thinner than other jerseys we’ve tried. The quality is okay-ish, but overall it is not worth what we paid for it."
3.0,"The quality of the sweatshirt is okay, but I’m very disappointed about the color not being accurate. I expected a hot pink, to match something I already own, but I received a washed out Barbie pink."
3.0,"Necklace is okay. I used it for work, simple and inexpensive"
3.0,"Don’t expect much as far as quality. Very plain, runs large."
3.0,"I bought it as a gift and the lady really liked it.  I felt the colors could have been a bit brighter, to me they were a bit faded looking."
3.0,If you like fit cut shorts these are really loose and runs very big. Have few other from same brand and these look Like a cheaper version.
3.0,"This fits pretty true to size or slightly small.  It is not oversized like the picture and the material makes the shirt cling rather than drape away from the body.  The shirt is still flattering, but the picture doesn’t match how it ultimately fits."
3.0,"Very pretty and comfortable.  I was disappointed with the size, as they were smaller than I expected.  I kept them anyway."
3.0,"Update: I gave the earrings to my daughter and she loved them. She has longer hair and thought the length was perfect. Based on her comments, I would up my rating to four stars.<br /><br />These are nice earrings, but overpriced for the value received. I ordered the earrings to wear with a black and silver sequined top - for a semi-formal dinner. The earrings are very casual and are better suited to jeans and blazers. Also, they are a little long for my taste, but that shouldn't bother the majority of purchasers. Overall, the earrings appear to be sturdy and well-made, but not worth the $60+ price tag. $30 is a more reasonable price for these earrings."
3.0,I bought this as Christmas gift. It did not have the reeds in it and had dust on the top of the bottle inside when he opened it. The smell is delightful which is why I gave it 3 stars but obviously a knockoff of the Esslux brand. I just used wooden skewers I had on hand but bothered that the gift was ruined. Guess that's what you get with Amazon.
3.0,"I should have known better, because I have two other pairs of these pants.  The denim material is the stretchy type dress-denim that doesn't look good dressed up and doesn't look good dressed down. You definitely cannot roll or cuff the legs, because that would look ridiculous.  Also, I think the legs of the denim version are wider than the other colors, so they almost look like trouser pants.  I like the solid colors version of these pants (I have them in red and black), but the denim just doesn't work."
3.0,This suit is not made for tall people at all.
3.0,I typically wear a size 8. These pants run a bit big.  I think a size 6 would have fit much better.
3.0,Fits as expected however after a few washes it starts to fade. Maybe it’s only hand wash which I would recommend and hang dry.
3.0,Too smog in the rear end.
3.0,"Finding a sports bra to comfortably support a large bosom isn't easy.  I'm curious as to the sizing of this particular bra.  While my order (and the product tag) both identify the size as 34DD, the hang tag on the bra also says it fits &#34;Cup Size Range B-F&#34;.  In no realm can a bra effectively contain a B cup as well as a DDD/F.  For the price, I'll keep it (if only as a backup) and see how well it performs."
3.0,"I absolutely loved my rings but the only problem is after wearing for a couple weeks, they stretched out and are now too big. Sad because it was one of my favorite pieces."
3.0,Fit as expected but texture not of good quality. Dress is way over priced considering it qualities.
3.0,"It was very cute,however it could be made with a softer lighter metal because when you where it it is very heavy and you know you have it on. Other then that it was very pretty."
3.0,I was hoping this would have a nice fit but is just way too large for my head. Looks ridiculous
3.0,Broke not to long after we got it. Was disappointed
3.0,I believe this was supposed to be for 0-3 months. My daughter is now 4 months and it’s still too big
3.0,I believe I was told the wrong size on what I needed for my new watch. this was WAY to small in width to attach to my watch. the quality of the band was great and was sent to my house very fast
3.0,"Kind of cheesy and cheap.  Bought it with the intention to wear, but I fear it may break.  May just hang it from the rearview mirror on my car."
3.0,"The top is very boxy, almost as if it is a man's shirt"
3.0,I liked how light this was. It was perfect for Cabo! I bought a large and am 36C and 5’8”. The chest was HUGE but the bottoms fit beautifully. Be aware that the white seams are see through!
3.0,"Researched luggage a lot before purchasing this.  One major complaint: why no zip compartment for shirts etc. in the interior of the carry on?  Additionally, why didn't at least one green strip (or something) get put on the back so that the luggage is more easily identifiable?  These deficits mean (to me) that the folks that design the luggage don't really use it.  If a cook won't eat their own meals, or mechanic won't drive a car he/she has repaired, what does that say ....  Note, there is however adequate interior space in the luggage, and I have no issues with quality at this time."
3.0,"This was a good value and cute. I wish it were not quite so thin of material. I choose white and you can see right thru it. Also a bit long for my taste. I haven’t washed yet, so I don’t have info on shrinking."
3.0,The shorts look just the picture. I bought a small based on the chart and reviews. The shorts some what fit. I could barely get them over a my hips. Mind that I Am a pear shaped and my hips are the widest part of me. Once over the hips I could not button them due to them bringing so tight around the hips. The zipper is right on the hip area for me. I g<br />ave them to my sister and she loved them.
3.0,I think it’s a little pricey for the quality. The fabric is coarse and wrinkly.
3.0,"The band is a lovely design, very feminine, makes a 44mm watch seem not so huge.  However, the clasp is awful.  At first, I thought it was just me being highly uncoordinated, but the squeeze clasp part that actually hooks into the chain link is just too -- deep? -- and you have to really work to maneuver it into the  link.  I had several friends try it, and to my relief, I was not the only person who hated the clasp connector.  I'm keeping the watch band, but I'm headed to a craft store to find a better alternative to the clasp it came with."
3.0,"The elastic band at the top makes me have muffin tops on my thighs. Since I can't return them I just scrunch them down to make them over the knee socks. Plus if you wear them to your thighs they roll down a lot, not the most comfortable"
3.0,"This purse looks great. Unfortunately, it started ripping on the inside within a week of me purchasing it. Not worth that kind of money."
3.0,Thin and definitely doesn’t hold in a jiggly bum. But it’s what the price offers. I just wear them under dresses not when I work out.
3.0,The silicone is a little thin I wished it was thicker but the colors are bright the hinges are strong And stays firmly secured to the gear fit 2. I haven't had the feeling that the band would break  and it takes on day-to-day activities
3.0,"I love the color and style. The snug waistband is flattering and perfect for a business casual office. However, the leg is cut slim, which makes it to tight / inappropriate for office wear, which is what I bought two pair for :("
3.0,"Great dress for a picnic or something to put on for a day in the park.  Thank God, I bought it a size to big because it was poorly made."
3.0,"The reflectors are great, but I'm CONSTANTLY adjusting this during runs.  The retractable waist fitter just doesn't stay put."
3.0,"Cheap shirts. Fit well, but are not good looking."
3.0,the product seems to be good. i return it because somewhat large. i got size 8 usa but comparable eu chart came out a bit bigger
3.0,"The picture is deceiving.  It shows the blue cover going up and around the removable key part.  In reality it only covers the remote part. See my picture.  I purchased this because the key easily releases due to a design flaw from Hyundai.  It does make the slot tighter, but the key will still release from the remote."
3.0,Gift for the child. Pretty decent quality for the price. Though a bit thin while being worn.
3.0,The color to cheap looking
3.0,I loved this little purse when I received it.. Couldn't wait to use it. The look is so upscale for the price point. The gold hardware and the alligator accent. A nice long adjustable strap with gold chains in both ends. Perfect for any outfit really.<br />Roomy inside with the main compartment being quite deep. Also having a small zipperd pocket as most purses do and 2 small open pockets on the other side.. The front has 2 zippered pockets. The top one would hold a cell phone. The bottom one has 2 small open pockets very small perhaps keys or money. The zippers are good quality and move smoothly. The top zipper is recessed which is a nice safety feature. It would be difficult for someone to unzip it without you knowing it.<br />They day I received this I had dinner with my daughter so I decided to use it First let me say that the moment she saw this purse... She wanted it!<br />Let me get back to the one flaw. And I'm assuming that mine was just defective. When I tried to use the zippered compartment inside it was odd. At first I thought it was just for looks. I couldn't open the zipper<br />I ran it back and forth but it wouldn't open. Finally I did get it. But when I tried to put my things inside the pocket pulled up from the bottom and puckered the entire inside compartment. It's like the small pocket is part of the bottom of the purse. Making it much smaller inside . As I mentioned though I believe its a flaw in this one. Not all of them.<br />That being said. This is a lovely little bag. I would recommend it.<br />It's very attractive and nice size.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful could you please pop👇 the button below👇<br />Happy Shopping 😊
3.0,It's a pretty cool ring but the print is not even so half the birds have their heads chopped off.
3.0,The vest extenders would not stay buckled
3.0,Not meant for large chested. Bottoms fit great but the top fits super weird and uncomfortable if you have anything larger than a B cup
3.0,"Love the fabric, very soft but sizes run small."
3.0,The strap is the same color as the bag and not brown as shown in the picture .
3.0,"Small, but works for me. durable."
3.0,"Not much cotton if any, but feels good."
3.0,"These are made out of nice fabric but the quality is not good. I received my three paid and as soon as I took the light gray ones out of the package, the seam was ripped three inches on the side of the leg. They also run really slim. My son is scrawny and they were still tight. Good for pajama pants but I'd never take him outside in them."
3.0,"These are not what I expected. I was excited that they would stay in place, but that did not happen. They sloughed down around my ankles, like all the other dress socks I've worn. I also thought they would be a little thicker, seeing they were &#34;everyday&#34; socks. They are very thin. I'll keep looking."
3.0,"Very cute jacket. At this time it seems to be unavailable but if they get more hopefully this review will help. Jacket is super cute. I am 5'6"" about 165 pounds...average body. 36dd chest. Jacket fits well...almost a lite loose everywhere except the sleeve length. I do prefer long sleeves..longer then wrist length but this falls prob about a in or so b4 that. Great if you were to push sleeves up like picture but even with a long sleeve shirt underneath popping out a little it still is cute. The jacket is thinner then an actual jacket..almost like a Jean jacket but different material. Its definitely not gonna keep you warm on cooler days  but the quality seems good so it's not cheap thin just a little lite. Also there were no tags on it as if it were a return from someone else...but looked new. I will definitely keep it because I really do like it. It has a very nice fit, wears well."
3.0,"I should have paid attention, the necklace is a bit heavier than I had wanted but other than that it is okay.  Quality is good and appears to be well made.  I probably would order from Jingrays again."
3.0,"My daughter ismedium size, this was smaller"
3.0,"The design is cute, tho it is see thru material.  I am normally a L and ordered an XL just in case and it fit just fine. I wasnt happy with the strings when I got the shirt on.  It just wouldnt be something I would wear so I returned it."
3.0,I can’t post video cause I returned them because I ordered wrong one’s for my daughter
3.0,So far no issues. Had it for 3 months now and I left my left over oil in it and I been able to go back to it without no rust.
3.0,The picture shows more so a gray color whereas the outfit is legit blue and transparent.  i was disappointed either way it was someone similar to style but just wasn't what i thought it would be:(
3.0,"At first i really liked this dress, mainly because it's 100% cotton and breathable. It fit really big at first, but upon washing it once, it shrank so much, that it was clingy. I like loose fitting clothes, so i won't purchase again."
3.0,"It’s very cute, but very little! I couldn’t give it to my 7yr old bc her phone wouldn’t fit in it, so I wrapped it as a gift for my little 3 year old cousin."
3.0,Did not keep my hands dry at all after one day of use. Also left blue stains on my hands for some reason.
3.0,It was way to big at the bottom. I would usually return it or give it away but it's extremely comfortable.  I use it as pajamas.
3.0,"Huge.  Even bought a size smaller than normal.  Sending back.  Was also expecting them to be a little on the long side since they are bb shorts but if I played for the knicks, they'd still be too long to wear."
3.0,Very nice but sooo heavy! Can't imagine wearing these for very long.
3.0,bigger the expected
3.0,I got these for my son who is a mechanic. I got him the medium size and should have got the large if not the extra large. The barley fit on his hands so he gave them to his little brother who will be using them for gardening. They seem to be made of nice material and they do keep his hands clean when he is digging his garden.<br />Besides the sizes not being the greatest they are made pretty good.<br />I received this product for free or for a discounted price for my honest review.<br />[[ASIN:B016H5J7RI Working Hands 10 Gauge Cotton/polyester Mechanics Gloves Dipped w/ Latex Medium (1 Pair)]]
3.0,avg tie
3.0,Very thin no sewing details
3.0,"Thought these looked good for my daily gym routine, but they are small, so tight, pretty uncomfortable (and my boobs are small).  Expect a tight fit, so much so that you can’t wait to get it off."
3.0,"I normally wear a US 8, so I ordered the 7-8 size. They are much larger and wider. 7-8 would probably be best for those who wear a 9-9.5. I gave three stars because they are comfortable and soft, but most likely I will not purchase again."
3.0,ITS HUGE! bothered my knuckle to wear it. Pretty otherwise!
3.0,"This item is much thinner than expected. It says hoodie but, it's basically a long sleeved t-shirt with a hood.  Luckily, my child will still enjoy this item."
3.0,Pendants are gold but chain is silver. So I went to hobby lobby and bought a gold chain to redo this mess. I decided not to keep the color crystals or the cards pendant that come with it to make more modern and adult-like. Growing up yugioh was one of my favorite cartoon franchises. But original charm bracelet that comes in the mail looks very pre-teen-like. All images are my new interpretation and creation of what I would of loved it to be. Last image is original item (what you get when you purchase this).
3.0,"Runs very small (at least on top). Saw a review that said 'I'm 5'2&#34; 180 pounds and the size 16 fit perfectly&#34;. I'm 5'3&#34; at 170, so thought size 16 would be great.  The other reviewers weight must be on her lower half! If you are larger on top, the bodice won't fit. There was about a 4&#34; gap at the back zipper.  There is no larger size available 😞. The quality of the dress itself seemed fine, if you can get the right size. And yes, it's time to make losing weight a priority!"
3.0,"PROS:  The material is sooooo soft. The design is ridiculously cool (80s neon miami looking + sharks.<br /><br />CONS:  the colors on the actual shirt are no where near as vibrant as they appear in the image; they appear much more muted.  This is a shame as I had hoped it would be a really cool tank with an 80s throw back feel. I normally wear a large but ordered an X-large based on sizing.  It still feels a little &#34;snug&#34;.  Price was a little high for a single tank that doens't deliver exactly what it looks like from the sellers images.<br /><br />I was hesitant to order, as there were no reviews on it.  But I've been eyeing this shirt for some time and I just decided it was time to bite the bullet. Overall, just a very unique design and I do indeed like it. Just wish it was more vibrant as described."
3.0,Not for necks.. How do I say this??? Other than on the smaller side....
3.0,"VERY light. Good for rain, u can fold it into a tiny bag. A bit big for a medium."
3.0,"This is basically a long sleeve t-shirt.  I was looking for something cute to provide some warmth for winter.  This had the cute, but that was it.  I ordered large, which fit as expected."
3.0,"The material was much cheaper than I expected given the reviews, but the details are nice and I'll be keeping it."
3.0,Belts are too stretchy and the buckle seems cheap.
3.0,"I bought these Capris because I needed a legging/tight that was not too long for me (5'2&#34;). They had a nice fit and the length was perfect for what I wanted which was at my ankle. As a workout pant however, I was disappointed because they are see-through material so I returned them."
3.0,"Is good enough. Cheap material. but, cheap. I hope when I wash still good."
3.0,"Cute top, but the material doesn’t give and it runs really small."
3.0,"I guess I should've read the hidden description. This shirt is not like the picture it's completely polyester. It reminds me of a child's Halloween custome. I've always wanted a Rolling Stones shirt & figured for the price of splurge on myself. I was so disappointed when I opened the package. Now I make sure not to go just by pictures but make sure to read what the material actually is. I thought maybe the more expensive ones they had, but in different colors, would atleast be cotton or something similar but no. Other than that I purchased my usual medium size & it fit but not like pictures. Since made of polyester, the fit was a bit snug & more than I wanted. I kept it for around house/PJ's."
3.0,Not like the picture .<br />Looks good vintage.
3.0,Decent quality hat. Easily adjustable for proper fit. Only complaint is the hat was shipped flat in an envelope - causing the hat to be completely wrinkled. Hoping after a few wearings the wrinkles will disappear.
3.0,Nice quality but it's impossible for me to use. Just too hard to remove cards. I have arthritis so it may be easier for other people.
3.0,It's heavy and bulky  very big on the face but super cool as long as you don't plan on wearing makeup
3.0,"Nice looking, got to give as gift but too hard for person to adjust band to fit. Everything is too tiny for our skills."
3.0,I really liked the design which is why I bought them and they look just as good in person as in the picture but they sent me the wrong size. I wanted the 8mm but they sent me 10mm so now I have to return them and won't be re-buying them because I'm not going to go back and forth trying to get the size I originally requested
3.0,The black paint came off within a week.
3.0,I bought for my daughter for prom.  It did not stick to her skin so it did not hold her up at all.
3.0,The dress is longer than anticipated based on the photos. I’m 5 feet tall and it hit about mid calf. The dress was kind of bulky which is ultimately why I returned it. If you are taller and curvier this may be the dress do you. The material is really nice and thick. It was a quality dress accent for the fit in my frame and body type.
3.0,"I love how these goggles fasten.  They are very comfortable.  I bought these specifically for the UV protection, so I hope the packaging is legitimate, since they are advertised as having UV protection, but they are made in China, so take your chances there.  When I swim on my back, these goggles only have front lenses and offer no peripheral vision., so I can't even see the lane lines and am running into them constantly.  I would not recommend these if you plan to swim laps.  They are good for recreational use only."
3.0,My feet are size 10-1/2. These were way too small. I couldn't take two steps without them coming off of my feet. I gave them to my girlfriend. Buy the larger multi-colored ones available on Amazon. Those fit.
3.0,"Material a bit thin and top of dress was a bit tight around chest. Not unexpected for the price, but I was hoping for more, so returned."
3.0,"Gorgeous dress, beautiful color, but no give and no stretch.  The waist was very small.  And the dress was a good length for me, but I’m 5’2” and it hit my ankle, so take that into consideration.  Unfortunately this dress in a larger size isn’t available on prime so I can’t reorder in a larger size and will have to go with something else."
3.0,Do not like the style on me. Does not look good on me. I am 5 ft. 4 inches about 150 pounds.
3.0,"Looked kind of goofy on me, your results may vary. Has that very 70's look to it. Promptly returned this item."
3.0,"Good, but a little heavy and the post is tarnishing."
3.0,"They almost did it, would be a pretty amazing price for an ABC watch if everything works decent. For me the temperature was way off (tried 2 different watches). With the temp on the main time display, I wasn't okay with that.<br /><br />Good: Time features, Baro appears working, Compass working. In general the buttons/configurations made sense to me.<br />Okay: Visibility of the screen is a little harder when not in direct sunlight or when it's not dark enough for the light to really come through well.<br />Okay: Light is only on for 5 seconds max. Pressing buttons while the light is on doesn't extend that time either, that would have really helped.<br />Bad: Temperature was way off on both watches I tried.<br /><br />More details about what I saw w/ the various sensors & features:<br /><br />Baro: When it came the value was off 1.0 inHg so I adjusted it per the local airport. I didn't give it enough time to see how well it continued to track honestly.<br /><br />Alt: With the baro set, the altitude was 30ft off what google is saying so, I'd say pretty good. I didn't have a lot of mountains to really test against though. The display allows you zero against your current altitude and display a difference value or to show a small trend display.<br /><br />Compass: Comparing to a basic backpacking compass, the compass seemed to work fine(after an easy calibration). It allows for a magnetic declination adjustment. Also you can lock your current direction to a bearing value that's displayed. The little circle dial even shows a bearing line & magnetic north.<br /><br />Temp: Out of the box, the temp seemed semi-close to the current value. The second I started wearing it though, the value increased rapidly. There is an adjustment you can do for the temp though but, after many, many tries to compensate for my body heat(apparently) I just couldn't get it to track well. Even not wearing it though, I found it extremely slow to react to temp changes (even as I press the Baro button to get it to re-calc). I actually returned the watch thinking that it was broken only to find out the replacement watch did that same thing. The cheapest kitchen thermometer will give you better & faster results. If I could just turn off the temp completely I would have kept this watch.<br /><br />""Weather"": The instructions were very unclear but, I think you set the little weather icon to current weather and it'll change maybe based on the baro pressure(I never witnessed it change).<br /><br />Time functions:<br />Pedo: Didn't get a chance to really test it out besides seeing it updating. Settings are height & step size. It does then calculate miles walked, kCal, Mins(walked I guess?),<br />Rec: It saves your Pedo info for  the last 15 days.<br />Stopwatch: Worked fine,  basic stopwatch.<br />Timer(countdown): Worked fine<br />Alarm: Worked well. 4 different timers, a snooze timer & the ability to have the time ding on the hour.<br />World Time: Nice feature, ability to display the time for a selection of major cities around the world along with your current time."
3.0,Decent product for the price fit as advertised no complaints.
3.0,Too flashy but okay for sunday service
3.0,"I really like it all except I went up a size because I figured it’d be a little smaller but it’s a good thing I’ve lost some weight otherwise it wouldn’t have fit, otherwise very comfortable for all day wear under my uniform"
3.0,These earrings are much larger than they appear in the picture. TOO LARGE.  I don't know what I would wear them with. Don't think I will be wearing these very often.
3.0,"Glasses are nice but their PR promo is a scam. They won't send you a pair for writing a review, like the card says."
3.0,"Great product idea, but must be made in sizes, one size fits all does not work. i have a medium to large head and it's way too tight, I had to pre-stretch it out for days on a ball before I could wear it comfortably."
3.0,It is very cute but too small for me:(
3.0,The material is cheap and can have fine threads be pulled in no time but overall the dress is ok
3.0,"These are adorable. ADORABLE. My daughter loves them and everyone who has seen her in them loves them. HOWEVER, she's had these for 10 days, not even wearing them everyday, and they're already ruined. The sparkle and design are wearing off where the boot creases when she walks. It's very frustrating since these are so new."
3.0,Loved the fit. Perfect length and great stretch. But see-through. Hated to return them but had to cause of that
3.0,Runs large by AT LEAST one size.  Risky purchase.
3.0,"Es hermosa la chompa , pero muy grande la envié arreglar con el sastre"
3.0,"Great fit for a younger girl. Pretty, but small size.. I purchased it for my niece age 7. She loved it."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:bb53cb47445492045c98352593ca685b]] Okay my brutally honest opinion, I would not particularly recommend these. The fabric is cheap and shear, there are loose strings all over the tank tops, I have found at least one hole in the seams of all of these, and they run incredibly small. I understand they're supposed to be ""fitting"", that was expected, but they're too snug.<br /><br />This is all coming from a big girl though, they might work better for mid size or smaller girls. I am 275 lbs, 5'6 1/2, and between an apple and rectangle shape. I have DD 40s and they're tight on the boobs but I don't mind. I bought these because I like grunge 2000's style and figured these would be perfect. They look great with something over them, that's the only way I'd wear them out.<br /><br />So I'd say go for it?? But keep your body type, weight, and height in consideration. Also if you're busty like myself (I'm big in all areas for being only 15), keep sizing in mind in that aspect too because these are snug on bigger boobs. ❤️🍒"
3.0,"I like the the shoe however, your shoes size run small. So they don't fit well. It's too much of a hassle to return them, so I'll just give them away."
3.0,Too much marterial in the top.
3.0,"This seemed like a cute and comfy house dress. Plus points: it’s really substantial and well made. It’s lined and is surprisingly heavy. Unfortunately, neither I nor my husband could get over the fact that it made me look like an overgrown baby. If you’re into that sort of thing, no doubt you’ll have found even “better” clothing for your purposes, but this dress was not my style."
3.0,"It's okay, but not as nice as I thought it would be.  I used it a few times and will use it again in the summer."
3.0,"The glasses have good color lenses,  but, the point where they attach to the glasses wasn't easy enough to attach to the glasses. It should have been easier to attach to the frame. I have had a pair of store bought that were much easier to put on my frame and flip up and down."
3.0,"I love how this looks. I just took a star off because of the smell that requires me to put it outside to air it out, and hope the smell goes away the next day. Also, the zipper is not so smooth in zipping and unzipping.<br /><br />Update: It is almost a month and the awful smell still persists. At one point, I put this inside my tote bag and my handkerchief also got the smell of it. I wish to return this but I lost already the original packaging that came with it. So sad. I’m taking another star off."
3.0,"I have never owned a pair of leggings in my life. I really don't know if I like them! BUT that's a personal preference. As far as the product is concerned, these seem to be decently made. I am mildly concerned about where the mesh attaches to the fabric; it feels a little flimsy. Also, if you are a shorter lady, these may present a problem for you. I am 5'0 and these are about 5-6 inches too long, which means they are huge around my ankles and bunch up annoyingly. I would recommend these for a woman of average height but definitely not my short brethren.<br /><br />I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,I was pleased with this write-up
3.0,"Its on the shorter side so if you are looking for a longer tank top, this one is not it. I kept it because its a cute top."
3.0,"I only wear one and it look nice but the strap won't lay properly, it sticks straight out and there's no<br />bracket to keep it down."
3.0,Mask is well built but very small.
3.0,These are super cute. but the lights stopped working after only 2 weeks after receiving them. Very disappointing
3.0,"This lanyard is super cute, but the metal clasp broke the same day I received it. I’ll be buying a key ring to attach to it. The lanyard itself is durable. The metal clasp is not."
3.0,"Definitely not the quality of material I expected, but still decent."
3.0,"they were suppose to be straight leg petite jeans.  the length was 4 inches too long, the style was boot not straight and they were too tight at the thigh and knee.  However the jeans are beautiful and well made."
3.0,"Looks nice for the price but it kind of pinch the sides of my head which makes it a little uncomfortable to wear for long periods,"
3.0,"The material is ok but if you’re looking for something like leggings with Lycra in it...this isn’t it. Legs are not tapered, somewhat like bell bottoms.  I ordered an xl and typically wear a size 8/10. It fit but large in stomach area but for someone with a long torso (5’8”), it rides severely up the front and back. There is no way possible I could wear that all day.  So I had a gf try on who is shorter/shorter torso and it does the same to her.  It’s like it isn’t cut correctly.  Would be more like something I’d wear to bed and not out (as far as quality)"
3.0,It is hard to put on and off.
3.0,Does not match.
3.0,"One size doesn't fit most.  Bought these for my son who’s in JROTC.  He’s 4’11” and they were still to big after adjusting.  I wound up having to cut and sew them to fit.  So if your short, don’t buy these unless you want to cut and sew.  Otherwise they work fine."
3.0,"This had the potential to be cute, but the top portion I felt had too much or extra fabric around the back and shoulder area that made the top of it gather and not lay down on the body. There is no stretch to this either which I didn’t have an issue with, but keep that in mind if your on the fence on which size to get."
3.0,"Not for me, but a friend gave to her daughters in school and they love it.  Will work well for cell phones and ids."
3.0,"When I first opened the package, the glasses were each wrapped plastic bags with plastic protectors around the lenses and arms. There were also two smaller packages containing a drawstring bag and lens cleaning cloth for each. I unwrapped the glasses and tried on the white pair, only to see that they were not what I was expecting. These appeared to be more geared towards women than men. The frames and lenses on the black pair were just the same, except for smaller arms. I like the polarized lenses and that’s the reason I kept the black pair and have a female friend the white pair. Buyer beware if you want mens glasses don’t get these!"
3.0,"There is absolutely NO leather smell and absolutely no Genuine Cowhide Leather Stamp either! It IS however, very well made. No longer own Leather & Taxidermy equipment - but I can assure you, this is NOT genuine leather! None of the dye had bled yet - that which is NORMAL for REAL LEATHER.  I am suspecting this is actually a PU Leather... a fancy name for imitation leather! I am keeping this belt because of the woven latices; which enables me to load and mount equipment on the belt."
3.0,The title says it all. I don't want larger holes in my ears. The larger post makes it a little more like costume jewelry. It has its place.
3.0,Product was cute but pilled and faded after a couple washes.
3.0,"nice quality leggings, they ran long and alittle big. i don't suggest working out in these because they will slide down"
3.0,I got an XL and it fits nice I like it
3.0,Just a bit large on the shirt. It was long
3.0,The scarves are beautiful and my daughter loves them. I was however disappointed to learn that after less than a day of having them they were covered in small runs/holes. I expected higher quality for the price.
3.0,Fit quite well but have a really weird waist band that you can't see in the picture.
3.0,The product fit great and I wanted to love the pants. The material is comfortable and the Chinese writing is lovely. But the seam ripped the first day I wore it so I got about an hour of use... disappointed
3.0,Very thin sweat pants
3.0,"I liked the color of the shirt so I ordered what would normally be the size I wear. Due to the material of the shirt, I would suggest going with a size larger then what you normally wear as it is a bit snugger then it looks in the pictures. I have worn the shirt twice only and the seams are already ripping out at the bottom and it is really frustrating since it is still a fairly new shirt. I am not mean with my clothes and hang dry just about everything, so it isn't due to abuse of the shirt. Overall, I am not 100% pleased, but I am not completely upset either."
3.0,Little small for a 1X. Sizing is off.
3.0,"These are comfy, the thigh bands are a little tight. Beware if you’re going to wear these while biking out, they’re completely see through. I use them on my spin bike so it doesn’t rlly matter but they are very see through"
3.0,"The jacket is a tad tight. Bought for inclement weather, so will keep it. If you buy, go one size up."
3.0,Wide width
3.0,"These glasses are very dark.  They're fine for driving, but for walking around, they make it hard to see."
3.0,"I loved the fit and the color.. but the pockets are cut wrong and the inside seem shows. And i tried to tuck them in as best as I could but they were cut to short and show no matter what. The pockets pucker. And the back pocket was sewn shoddy as well. The fabric is thin and stretchy I could have chosen a smaller size. They feel thin and cheaply done, they should be under 20 bucks forsure. I have returned them for the flaws in the pockets. I wont buy another will try a different band. Hope this helped."
3.0,It’s heavy and heavy to wear. Also runs small.
3.0,Was happy with the fit but these certainly do not stand up to repeated washings in a washing machine.  I washed them twice and seam on the inner thigh area unraveled.
3.0,"The watch itself is fine, but I keep it on my keychain and therefore it gets bumped around a lot and, as expected, the crystal has gotten a smal crack.  This would be a 4 or 5 star item if it had protection for the face of the watch."
3.0,"These are pretty good average scrubs.<br />I ordered my size compared to other scrubs that I have purchased (the size fitting comfortably, but loose being a large). I figured since 42% reviewer based sizing says it runs small, I would order a large and be safe. The pants are little tighter than I would like it, but they fit. I would consider them a medium. The shirt on the other hand, I have the opposite problem. I would consider it somewhere between a XL and 2XL. It hangs real low, like a tunic. They do have a sizing chart currently listed in their product description, which would help with the pants but I do not know about the top.<br />Upon opening the package and trying on the clothes, they were very stiff and felt like they would not breathe well. It was not as bad after a run in the washing machine, but I am hoping it gets better with more washes.<br />One thing I was NOT happy about was the color. I picked color &#34;Black-A4&#34;. The angled side view of the shirt, it appears to be black on the sides. I was very disappointed when it came in the mail and was actually a dark gray. My work does not allow you to wear ANY color on your scrubs other than black, so I can not wear it and it is of no use to me.<br />The sewing and stitchery is well, does not seem cheaply made compared to other scrubs. The style looks nice.<br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,Narrow in the toe box.  Stiff.  Lower quality compared to previous Munro  Returned
3.0,It's a pretty skirt but it doesn't fall like the one in the picture. It's nice but please look at the photos submitted by other reviewers. That's how your skirt will look. Also the belt is literally a long piece of tulle no shape no definition.
3.0,"I have a larger head and short hair, this is a bit snug on me and doesn't stay on through the night.  Not a bad product just wasn't the right choice for me."
3.0,Cups too thin. Not what I expected
3.0,"This mask is ok, but I'll probably give it away. I like the material it's made of. It reminds me of a swimsuit. It's pretty stretchy. The first time I put it on I had a ponytail in my hair. I'm pretty sure I pulled hair out trying to pull it down. I don't recommend anything in your hair. I think it runs too small. I measured my head to help others. I measured loosely from my nose all the way around. It measured 60 cm or 23.5 inches. While the material is stretchy, it felt very binding around my neck. I didn't like it. I felt like I couldn't breathe and had to take it off. Also there are no ear loops. I'm worried that as it stretches out, it will fall down. Overall just not for me."
3.0,"Super shiny, I read in a few reviews that they are not. They are. Fit is fine, but I was looking for a different material/look."
3.0,Love It but I think I got the wrong size I need it bigger so I'll be repurchasing later on.
3.0,"It’s a nice piece but it’s pretty cheap.  Fake leather is hard and the hardware will fade quickly.  It’s cute for a couple wears, but you get what you pay for here."
3.0,Material was ok however the zipper is very hard to zip up.
3.0,Way too big and way too long. Even for an x-small.
3.0,"Ah! This dress came in the most beautiful burgundy color and looked so pretty but didn't quite work for me. I am 5'8'' and this is wayyyyy too short . Barely covered by rear. Forget sitting, stooping or even walking in this dress. It looked obscene for my height and hence had to go back. It also fits kind of tight on the chest area and pulls out some fat which can look a bit weird."
3.0,Fitted my 5 & 1 year old but i struggled to get their toe in i had to stretch them out and still gave my kiddos blisters for wearing them
3.0,"Really pretty earrings, but mine came missing one of the crystals.  I decided not to return because it's in the back so it's not all that visible.  I hope the others don't fall out easily!"
3.0,The sleeves didn’t fit and it keep falling second the teeth didn’t come with glue
3.0,looks great but It is hard on hand :(. going back.
3.0,Pretty good bag
3.0,"I wanted to love this sweater because it is really cute but so can’t give it more than theee stars and here is why. I wore it today to drop my son off at school and get groceries. I got home and noticed it is already unraveling in the front. Perhaps the cart handle bumped it, I do t know but I expect to get more than one wearing out of a sweater. I can not recommend this product."
3.0,Nice but it’s half size too small
3.0,These are super cute!!  But when they finally arrived I had to glue them together because of how poorly they are made.
3.0,Runs a little small and it is a little thin.
3.0,"These panties are made of strong material and well made, but they are sized wrong. Despite the fact that every other pair I've ever bought fits properly in my size, these were incredibly hard to put on and started to curl at the waistline. It felt like I was wearing some sort of armor rather than underwear because of it.<br /><br />That said, I'm sure if you size up, you'll find them good."
3.0,"Tight, wrinkles easily."
3.0,The sizing for these jeans were completely off. XL is more like a M. Could barely fit over thighs which sucks because the style is so cute. I do not think it goes higher than XL and is not made for curvier body types.
3.0,Very nice but one pin keeps falling out 😦
3.0,"a little small.  disappointed in black fabric (bottoms & back) - sheer, like lingerie.  am returning"
3.0,"Please make sure you read the size carefully.  I am 5'7"", I have a normal size and I could not snap the closure, it is too short for me in the body.  The material is very nice, heavy and just what I would have wanted."
3.0,The watch is cool . But i had and allergic reaction with the plastic/rubber  not sure what material . I had a huge rash in the area where the band come in contact with my skin . I couldn't were it anymore.
3.0,"Different.., and weak. Only 2 outta the 4 glowed & within 2 hours of wear all broke."
3.0,"At first glance' this is a pretty nice product. However,  after only a short time, the coating comes off."
3.0,"I normally wear XS or S! In ordered S, it was tooo large for me! Need to stitch it to wear it🥹"
3.0,"Advertised as one size fits all, but cannot adjust small enough for my 13 year old son."
3.0,Super cute design and good material. My only complaint is that it fits to big on my head.  If you have long hair that is thick it may work for you.
3.0,It just didn't fit right. The company was kind enough to refund me the purchase. I really appreciated that.
3.0,Runs big...baggy at thighs and knees.  I recommend ordering a smaller size.
3.0,"I like them, but they could be just a bit longer--and I'm only 5'4&#34;."
3.0,Much smaller than anticipated more than a size too small
3.0,Very very thin ad not as plush as pictured. I’m keeping it but would not buy again.
3.0,It did look good and fit well but my toddler complained of pain behind the heel and I did find it had scratched her heels. I had to put bandaid to prevent further injury. I use it now only with socks.
3.0,I am so disappointed by these socks. They are a wonderful design and great colors. The first time I wore each pair they started pilling. I can't wait to see how much more they will pill after washing and dying.
3.0,Runs ridiculously small.  My niece who is a size 6 tried this large size on and it fit her perfectly.  Nice fabric.  Pretty print on fabric.  Seems nicely made.  Go market it in China or something.  Doesn't fit real world women.
3.0,It's thick material tight fitting
3.0,The picture looks much better than the real thing! It is cheaply made!
3.0,"This was okay. It was a little small for my neck, I felt like I was choking but it is cute and matches my clothes."
3.0,Beatific boots but had to return because even though I selected size 10 at time of purchase the order shows and product delivered was a size 8. Return was easy and refund issued quickly.
3.0,I needed these silk necklace cords for some pendants. The silk cord is &#34; not very robust&#34; and the extension chairs do not seem very strong - I would not trust using the extension chains for fear of losing my pendants if they came apart.
3.0,I’m like 5’8 and shapely and they fit no flooding
3.0,work well but a bit tight fitting i ordered xl and my hands are not overly large and they still are tight . good quality other then that
3.0,"This hat seem to be smaller than XL as most other XL hats are just slightly loose on my head, but this is very snug verging on tight"
3.0,"These are cute booties and made well considering the low price tag. I'll have to break them in, they're a bit tight. That's the case with most new shoes, though. The toe on these is very pointy, so I'm not sure why the description says round toe. Anyway, these look cute and I've received compliments on them already."
3.0,I usually wear a medium. so I ordered a large and could barely squeeze into it. I wish I had ordered 2 sizes up the first time LOL. time to send it back and get another. beautiful dress though
3.0,"Cute, but VERY difficult to close, and when closed, no longer fits into the carry case. But it is a good umbrella otherwise, Just needs a lot of raw strength to close it after use!"
3.0,"Such a good blouse but toooooo small, like if I need l, I have bought xxl, and it's still so so so small....about how it's made - perfect! Fabric is good and feels so gentle for your skin"
3.0,Needs a larger clasp
3.0,I love the looks of this belt but it isn't as high quality as I like. It also tend to come &#34;unfastened&#34; which is embarrassing
3.0,Wore one time took them off went to put one on and it snapped and threw beads all over. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Seams weren’t the best quality, Looks cheap. But I do get a lot of compliments."
3.0,Thin plastic
3.0,They r soft and easy to wear
3.0,"I like the fit and comfort, but the picture is an iron on and I fear what will happen in the wash.  I promise I will follow instructions."
3.0,These skorts fit well in waist but are a relaxed fit which it doesn't say in description. They flare out &amp; look like an A line skirt.
3.0,"I ordered the pink, off-white, dark purple set in size 5. They arrived quickly and fit great but I'm a bit disappointed with the colors. The pink is accurate, a pastel baby pink. The off-white is definitely gray. The dark purple is more of a bright violet. See two photos to see what I mean. There's also a noticeable middle seam on the rings when you look close but that doesn't bother me as much as the purple color being off."
3.0,cute just not for me
3.0,Material is really nice and warm but it’s too small. I’m 150lbs and 5ft 3in. I’m 3 weeks post partum so I’m still losing weight so no idea if I should keep them or not :-(
3.0,Didn’t work with my shoes I have the new Nike SpongeBob didn’t clean the shoes wasting money and time.
3.0,Shrunk after washing and fit was tighter
3.0,"I have pretty feminine small hands. My middle finger measures just under 8.5cm and a palm size of about 20.5cm. These gloves did not fit me, they were just shy of fitting perfectly. I think it’s more accurate to say they’re 8cm gloves or maybe juuuust a bit smaller. The main issue though is the thumb, the fingers were only a few millimeters short of fitting me but the thumb was another story, it was like a baby thumb size. But to those who buy these and can’t quite fit them worry not! You can simply cut the tips off the fingers, or down to the knuckle if you’d prefer, then  reinforce the seam by turning the gloves inside out and sewing up the ends to make sure it doesn’t unravel, and boom! They’ll fit perfectly. With an added benignity of making typing on your phone easier. Plus! The gloves are just tight enough to wear rings with them on."
3.0,Sizing is off. It's really soft and looks cute but does not fit.
3.0,Basic bracelet helper. Ordered pink but got plain wood ones. Really though would be nice if the teeth were coated in rubber so you don't have metal on metal. Using for fine jewelry and afraid of scratches.<br /><br />Actually if coated with rubber or silicone you wouldn't really need the teeth.
3.0,Bought a small and it was pretty much a large/XL. I know hockey jerseys are big but this was a bit much. Other than that the quality was good.
3.0,"I had to return this dress due to it being very small. I thought that the material was a knit, but was more like cotton/linen"
3.0,The skirt part of the dress is terrible. The stitching on the pockets are poorly made. The dress skirt is a thicker canvas material so the pockets stick out like no tomorrow. I had such high hopes for this dress.
3.0,"Key Fob is very attractive and compact., fit my fob perfectly....attached key chain great for extra keys...however, it had absolutely NO RFID qualities.  Once, it many, many tries, it locked the car..the rest of the time, nothing.  Very disappointed because I completely fell in love with its looks and workmanship."
3.0,Nice granite base with handle for easy carrying.  I felt the tube to hold the umbrella could have been higher for more stability.
3.0,These were just okay. The colors were no where near as vibrant as the pictures. For that reason I returned mine.
3.0,"Very light weight,  like umbrella material, did  not  get  use it in rain as it arrived too late for my vacation. Looked better  in picture. Returned it."
3.0,I got this in white and it was very sheer. You'll need a slip to wear this color. The style is cute though
3.0,I returned cause it wasn’t worth the price for me. But it was pretty cute on!
3.0,"It's amazing that you can get a watch for three bucks. Keeps good time, but bit too large and gaudy for me. I won't be wearing it."
3.0,I could always wear this necklace because it wa to short and it can only fit over a childs head but the design of this necklace it magnificent.
3.0,Small wrist band
3.0,"Looks exactly as the photo, very pretty. But the post came off literally as I was pulling the backing off while removing it from the package. I'm lazy about returns so I'm probably just going to try and fix it myself somehow...I bought another cuff from this company and haven't had any issues so it might just be a one time flaw. Although the posts are really, really thin, they might want to consider making them ever so slightly thicker.<br /><br /> I'd buy from them again."
3.0,Cheap construction; cheap looking.
3.0,"Looks NOTHING like the image. There is no support infrastructure, so the hat sits on your head more like a ball cap. Not thrilled but for a cheap gag, it passes - barely. Purchase with that in mind."
3.0,"I ordered three pairs. At least one button has already popped off two pairs in only a few uses, which is unfortunate because these are great pants. The fit is just right. But they're useless with missing buttons. I'll probably see them back on, but I shouldn't have to do that so soon."
3.0,WITH THE TIME THE COLOR GETS OPAQUE
3.0,Cute product but expensive. I drip dry because I’m afraid they will shrink. Have 4 pairs
3.0,I liked the pendant but it would of been better if the entire necklace came with it. Apparently I only purchased the pendant and no necklace. So that was a bummer
3.0,"It's not all that perfect for my hair type. In fact, it would work better as a scarf than a hat seeing how floppy it is."
3.0,It does not look very alike a cat
3.0,"These pieces are really cute, but more for a child. They feel a little costume-y. I'm glad I bought them, but I don't know that I would recommend them to friends without explaining how small the necklace is and toy-like."
3.0,"good material got it for the horses , very deep and dark inside  hard to find things in it."
3.0,Some of these stopped working really soon
3.0,This dragonfly dangle is so small.
3.0,This dress was thinner than one ply toilet paper The stitching was horrible but would you expect for 10 bucks
3.0,"It's okay. One-sided , unlined sash."
3.0,"Cute top upon arrival. The blue was pleasing (though not quite as dark as web pic). The material/fit is soft,  comfortable, and hangs well but not too loose.  I am 5'4"", 165, 34-36 DD, bought Large. HOWEVER, after the the first wash in cold cycle with dye/perfume free detergent, there was splotches of discolor where it seems the dye did not take well.  A new top has now become a bum-around top. Disappointed unfortunately."
3.0,Fits alright. But after a few wears started to roll
3.0,"Great pant, but they're REALLY long.  Love, love, love the side pocket."
3.0,The material was okay.  But it is way bigger than I expected. But I do not want to go through the hassle of return. I guess I will keep it
3.0,"I ordered 3 of them.  Each one had a flaw.  On one the zipper stuck.  On one, the ink was very faded.  On the third, the picture didn't match the one shown (similar, but a little different.)  You wouldn't know they weren't uniform, of course, unless you ordered more than one and compared them, but when given to several children at the same time (neices' Christmas presents), it would be obvious that some were a little more well made than others, and some printing was clearer than others.  Too bad.  Cute pencil case, but not that great of quality."
3.0,"This mermaid suit is quite adorable. It is true to that of the photo. It shimmers like the photo and is absolutely stunning. It feels great. The downside, it's design is just cut weird. I got this suit in an XL for my daughter and she's about 5'7&#34; and a size 10. Waist wise, it fit her. Length wise, there was no way. This suit is made for shorter people. The black tie piece in the front didn't go all the way to the green. It stopped midway on the chest.<br />The suit ships from overseas, so if planning a trip be sure to plan accordingly and expect a wait.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"The print on this dress is similar to the picture and really very pretty. The style is pretty similar and the fabric is decent quality, however, it drapes MUCH differently, almost making a bell at the bottom and kind of sticking out. I could have made do with that but at 5'3, 125 lbs, 34D, the top did not cover my chest. The rest of the dress fit relatively well so I think a M might be too big overall. I returned the S and may consider a M. Not a bad dress just may need to size up if you are chesty."
3.0,"Love the color scheme and overall look online, but it didn’t flow down as it does in the picture, but rather it flows out. It’s a lovely dress still, just not for me. The top fits well (I’m a medium and bought a medium) and the fitted waist was nice and flattering, but the way the dress flares out didn’t work for my hips. If you have curvy hips this might not be for you. Super comfortable though so I’m bummed it wasn’t for me."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:1b026803646a005ac16058186c7404f0]] Hello! I’m 5’10, between 147-150 lbs<br />The color of this dress definitely stands out .. very vibrant and pretty. Unfortunately, the dress did not flow to the floor as expected for me. I had to keep pulling the shoulder part down if I wanted to show a little skin. I ordered the medium.. it was more flowy on me then I wanted .. I was hoping for a little more of a snug fit. I’ll more than likely wear this only around the house. I hope this review and video helps with your decision. **Peace**"
3.0,Color is starting to dilute already. Worn about four times.
3.0,"Yea so these belong in some Steampunk thing but hey they do the jobzor. I only buy best bang for the buck stuff. So hey, bang bang, my buck went far. Used them in Hawaii while surfing, I was hoping when I was paddling out if a set hit me in the face *ouch, damn you, set!* it would allow me to see and keep paddling. YEa, worked out better in my mind. They do fog up quite often, defeats the point of having them if you have to stop to defog all the time. But at least they have some UV protection.<br /><br />To be truthful I don't think anything as small as swim goggles could ever fully be fog proof. Fogging up has all about to do with temperature differences, humidity and science crap Bill Nye would explain. When China can solve that we have worse things to worry about."
3.0,Disappointed but will keep the product. Looks cheap and has scratches on the bracelet. Doesn’t sparkle as much as I hoped:’(
3.0,"The fabric of this pajama set is really thin. There's obviously color to it, but you can still see through the fabric easily. I like to feel like I'm wearing fabric of a bit more substance."
3.0,"This dress fits perfectly. I bought a 2x. I am 5’4 and weigh 270 (size 20/22). The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the length is shorter than expected (probably due to my curves) and I ordered mauve and it came in a bubblegum pink.<br />I’m not going to be able to wear it in the wedding I ordered it for,  it I’ll certainly get some use out of it."
3.0,"Very pretty, fabric relatively soft but runs on the small side."
3.0,"Was a gift, so can't really say much"
3.0,"Got the watch yesterday haven't gotten my link removal tool in yet, but from the looks and feel of the watch its not as heavy and kinda flimsy.  But I mean $30 bucks and you get a watch with the smaller faces that work.  The day/night thing is working right, im not sure how I set it, The day thing is a life saver because well, sometimes the day of the week escapes my mind more than the date."
3.0,So cute for my daughter but the ends to chip and wear very quickly but worth the price
3.0,"This was too tight in my head, but overall decent quality for the low price."
3.0,The side string was too much.
3.0,Doesn't match the shorts!
3.0,"Once closed, and it is a pain to do so, it stays closed."
3.0,These fit okay but offer no support and the straps role inward.
3.0,"The googles work well and we’re very reasonably priced, but the clasp is very flimsy.  I don’t expect it will last long."
3.0,Its not big size like you say
3.0,estam bien
3.0,Everybody is saying how soft this hat is. I have a minus 33 hat that is Much softer than this. Also whoever said this is not itchy must have nerve damage in the head area. Return likely especially at the price.
3.0,Size not accurate.
3.0,"The rings are too large to slip safely on the ear without falling off. As a whole, it is masculine."
3.0,Not very good quality but fine for the price.
3.0,"It is as described, but it's also massive. I'd honestly look better wearing an actual bucket on my head than this hat. It's to no fault of the hat itself, just be warned that if you have a small or skinny head, this probably won't be comfortable."
3.0,"I've now ordered this bag twice. I was bummed because for a $20 bag, I loved the first one. The zipper broke, luckily I had only had it about a week, so I returned it and immediately ordered a new one. The 2nd one came and was completely different. The inner material was different and way cheaper and it didn't have the white stitching the 1st one did. Ugh. Anyway, whatever, it keeps me organized but I'm annoyed. Too much hassle now to return. So beware, you could get a nicer one, just the luck of the draw I suppose."
3.0,My only problem with this is that the ball keeps falling off
3.0,"I ordered the black first and love the purse, but it came with a fish smell on the inside that took days to get to go away , I order the red hoping that the red would not be the same because I love the look of the purses just not the fish smell that comes inside , so great purse if your willing to wait and air out the fish smell before wearing it sn : I'm not a over purse packer , so I never over fill my purses so mine held up just fine it was just the smell it comes with for me"
3.0,There OK and there hard to open up the screw earrings
3.0,They are okay. They fit my rushed need. I would get a clamping one in the future as there's are hard to get on the tie.
3.0,I absolutely love these but quality kind of sucks. I've been using these for my work outs and notice one the black pair is starting to fall apart. I guess if you use these for normal day wear it would be better.
3.0,i didn't receive my belt.
3.0,Top fit true to size bottoms not so much
3.0,"Looks Good, but Heavy and Doesn't Last Long"
3.0,Did not fit well.  Too small.  Tried to return them but too much trouble to ship to UK.  Donated them to Veterans.
3.0,I love this hoodie.. but its already starting to rip at the seams of the hood
3.0,"Works great as a protective case. Phone is protected from scratches and scuffs, slight shock absorbency. If you can get a black that would be better, the lighter color grabs dirty and won't let go. I try to clean the case and phone with alcohol every so often, but these stains are in there. The material discolors over time, and also collects its fair share of scuffs and gouges.<br />As for its function of clinging to solid surfaces, it sorta works. Not really. Even brand new the case would cling for anywhere between 30 seconds to two minutes. No warning before dropping. When you use the case in everyday life and it gathers any sort or dust or scratches as cases do.. it hardly clings at all.<br />It does trip people out when you stick it on a window, but you better grab it back quick or it'll fall and everyone will laugh at your stupid gimmicky case."
3.0,Not fitting all type of sunglasses
3.0,Broke within a month...
3.0,I like them. After a while they begin to sag a little.
3.0,Bought a pair for each of two granddaughters. I bought their sizes. Both got blisters the first time they wore them. Sent them back.
3.0,"This bag did not work out for me, so I returned it. It is much too small to hold a 13&#34; macbook, as the zipper on the top of the bag will not zip easily with it in it. The worst part of the bag for me is that the flap in the front does not have a button or a magnet to keep it closed, so if the bag is packed full, the flap sticks straight out. The PU leather is also very hard and not flexible. I would not recommend this bag to anyone who wants to use it for school. However, if you only pack a few things in it, the bag looks pretty cute!"
3.0,"Well the hat wasn't packaged well, has some white residue on it. The back is fully hand sewn. It kind of looks like a iron on from the picture but it's not. It's a nice hat but wasn't what I was expecting"
3.0,"It needs an elastic strap. The ribbon is dramatic, but it constantly loosens. You are always adjusting, tightening."
3.0,"I went between 2 and 3 stars. It's a beautiful design but the color isn't as pictured.  It's more yellow then rose color gold. Or brassy yellow color, okay not sure lol what color to give it but it's not rose. The stone is yellow. It's not bad, just looks funny unless you were clothes that match it. It's to bad because the design is just beautiful. I'm not sure the picture captured the strange color that it is."
3.0,"It would be beautiful, but its literally a photo glued under a bubble... I thought it would have been three dimensional."
3.0,"I wanted to like this tank. It is cute, but it was so tight & tiny I couldnt even get it on to see how it would look. I ordered my normal size Large (I am 5'2 and wear a 38C bra for size reference). The tank I receiced was marked large but looked like an x-small. It was so tight & tiny. I returned it & didnt try ordering a larger size. I dont like wearing clothes that are so tight that i cant breathe. I could have tried sizing up a bit, but I think a larger size would be too long & still too clingy for me. The material had some stretch but not much so it was like a body shaper. It doesnt have enough stretch to squeeze into it if it is too small"
3.0,"Okay so the product is great but I bought the blue and recieved the tan! When I got it I just figured I must of chosen the wrong color... But nope lol I looked at my past orders and realized i just received the wrong color. I kept it, it's a great product. Just don't expect to get the color you choose."
3.0,Too short for my ears but seemed like they would be comfortable.
3.0,"This dress is so amazingly comfortable and flattering. I bought the purple and it has a rich, royal look to it. I typically where a size 18 (U.S.) and I bought the extra large and it fits perfectly; but the material is stretchy so I think size 16 and 20 would be fine in this XL too. Usually with fancy dresses I have to wear shape contouring underwear to smooth out my rolls, but I can wear this dress with regular underwear and it still looks great. I'm 5'2'' and the bottom of the dress comes down to just above mid calf on me, which looks nice. The neck dips to reveal quite a bit of cleavage, but it's not inappropriate or anything like that - just may be too much for some people who are very modest. But I cannot emphasize enough how comfortable it is. I've had this dress a little over a year and it is the first thing I reach for when I need to dress up. I like it so much that I am now buying the same exact dress in two more colors. Oh yeah and one more thing - the tag says to dry clean it but I washed it in my washing machine set to cold water, delicate and it came out just fine.<br /><br />UPDATE....<br />I bought this dress in black and red and am so disappointed. The material on these two dresses is more stiff and not as soft or stretchy. It's also very hot. Both dresses are also tighter in the shoulders and waste. The black one was so tight it was hard to get it on. These dresses are not even close to being as comfortable as my purple one in the exact same style that I bought a year ago. Also the hem on the black one is uneven - its longer on one side. I'm returning both. Poor quality control has lowered my opinion of this manufacturer."
3.0,"Eh.... not the greatest quality, but you get what you pay for"
3.0,"Expected a better quality. They very well made/constructed -but, materials were low-grade & weren’t what I thought I was purchasing."
3.0,Stripes are sewn on...<br />I would prefer printed on.
3.0,They ran too big but it's better than too small
3.0,Fits great. Color is not at all what the picture shows so I wasn’t able to use it for the wedding I am in. The picture shows more of a light blush color. In person it is very bright pink. But it is a very pretty dress.
3.0,They are comfortable and fit nice but are a lil bigger than the black ones I also bought love the product
3.0,Belt was awkward but otherwise cute. Had to return could not get belt to lay right.
3.0,"These are really cute, but the fabric is not breathable.  Also, inside is white, which I hate that it shows your makeup that has rubbed off onto it and constantly looks dirty. (looked dirty within minutes of wearing it). Also, the one with leaves on it, that looks cream or beige in background is actually pink.  Not a fan.  But the biggest issue is that the fabric is really non-breathable."
3.0,Cute- but WAY too big!
3.0,This shorten after wash so go at least one size bigger
3.0,"I usually buy Armani, but decided to go BOSS. I would give it 4 stars if they would have changed the design slightly. The placement of where the screw fastens the frame together on both ends appear in my peripheral vision. Maybe i needed a wider frame, but other than that its an okay purchase."
3.0,Ran small but great tank!!!
3.0,"I think this is a pretty good everyday jacket (I haven't try it for the real outdoor, like snow mountain yet, and I also haven't get a chance to test it on extreme weather yet, it's not the time of the year to have that kind of weather).  Just checking on the material, pretty nice, good stylish.<br /><br />but there are two things i don't like.  first, I think this is a bit too heavy, maybe it not heavy as an outdoor jacket, but I considered it heavy as an everyday jacket.  second, no water repelling, which I would expect an expensive jacket like this will include, either by spray some chemical and lasts for some times, or using water resistant material for the outer layer.<br /><br />Anyway, not that I don't like this jacket, but I will question if with worth the price tag."
3.0,"I received on time, and it was what I expected but a little tight across the shoulders even though I bought a larger size"
3.0,The pocket works great for placing my phone in while running or working out. The waist band fits fine and is comfortable. The leg are too long and should be shortened. they almost reach my knee and are loose fitting. I definitely will not be able to wear these with anything other than sweat pants.  They are just okay
3.0,"This shirt was actually pretty small and the Material was see through. My usual size is a medium for tops, I would’ve needed a large for this one. Not worth it in my opinion but would probably look nice if I had ordered a bigger size."
3.0,It does not have the thick padding I usually expect with bike shorts but it is better than nothing
3.0,"I purchased another color of these socks (white with polka dots https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KEE7F4A/ref=twister_B01KEE7F7W?_encoding=UTF8&th=1 ) and really liked them so I thought I would try this tie dye color.  Unfortunately, the material seems to be different in this color.  They feel more like thick nylons, snag easily, and offer no compression.  Granted, my calves are tiny and even the polka dot ones offer little compression, but I do feel like the dots are are thicker and provide some support.  I'm bummed because I was hoping to buy the tie dye in all three colors.  Guess I'll be sticking to the polka dots!"
3.0,The shoes were wonderful except too tight.  Had to return!
3.0,"Purchased these back in October and I train on average 6 days a week (strength, cardio, running, cycling). I use these mainly for strength training (Barbell Squats, deadlifts, bench, etc) and cardio (elliptical, row, treadmill, etc) 5 out of the 6 days I train. When I first purchased these tights they were a great fit, natural feeling, warm when indoors or as a base layer, no complaints. Three month later they aren't a great fit anymore. I am consistently pulling them up after every set while training or sitting, they can't seem to stay on my hips. It's annoying to have a plumber's crack loading weights or using gym equipment."
3.0,not sharp.
3.0,it was too big and heavy. very good quality and super cute just not what I was looking for
3.0,"Beware if you have heavy arms are muscles it stretches but may be snug still if you have aforementioned, otherwise very cute and nicely made !"
3.0,Returned it because it was to youthful looking and had no body to the material.
3.0,"Liked the colors, next round I'll get a size up."
3.0,Was good for a couple weeks but the chain broke. I will be replacing the chain because the holder is nice.
3.0,"Bought these to wear with my daughter's Halloween costume. They were great, looked nice, she loved them, but sometimes she drags her toes and these were shredded after the first wear. I'd say ok to wear once or twice, but don't expect to wear more than that."
3.0,Nor typical sweater material. It's a silky fabric
3.0,I liked the style. They are much smaller than expected and fairly easy to put on but didn’t stay closed with high collars on clothing or coats
3.0,"It's a nice color, same as the picture just about, but it is very stiff, marginal quality material, and it arrived completely mangled and warped, a total mess, in a broken plastic bag.  I can not straighten it.  I do not know what to do.  Can not be worn like this.  I might return it.  Fast shipping but very bad packaging.<br /><br />Edited:  I decided to keep it even though I can not straighten it, but I bent the edges a little to make it even and I shaped it as best as possible on my head.  2 Stars for the nice color and it does help with shielding from the sun.  The fit is a bit large."
3.0,Just what my son wanted big boy disney
3.0,Un poco pequeño.pero bonito
3.0,I order the 1-2 the pants fit great but the shirt is way to small!
3.0,"A lot longer than expected, have to tuck in."
3.0,Kind of difficult to put on and really heavy but once on really pretty
3.0,I always need to wear a belt with these pants. They fit great in the morning but practically fall off in a few hours without a belt. I don’t have that problem with other brands
3.0,"From Bellroy's ads, I thought I would end up with a super-thin wallet.  The high price suggested that it might be magic.  However, it wasn't magic.  Nice wallet, but no thinner than the one I already had.  I returned it and got my money back."
3.0,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but these are not nearly as sparkly as I thought they'd be."
3.0,These are nice bras colors are beautiful but it would have been nice to receive the right size I ordered a large and I received a 2 xl. Would have given 5 star without a doubt but part of a seller's job is to make sure the right item is shipped. Bra is excellent quality and the zipper is so much easier to put on than climbing  Into it. Up the shipping quality and you have an excellent product.
3.0,"Definitely not authentic Ralph Lauren, but they will do. They ran a tad small and were a tad shorter than the authentic chino shorts are."
3.0,they are a little small but good quality
3.0,"This hat is adorable. Unfortunately my head is too big for it, so I'm having to return it. I could wear it for about an hour before I had to take it off. I loved the accordian-like flexibility of the rows--I could keep it &#34;short&#34; or pull it down a bit.<br />There was a little bit of clear glue left on one corner of the design, but if it had fit I probably could have picked that off."
3.0,It was missing a spacer for the screws and the gators on the bottom is covered up by the bumper
3.0,Chain broke almost instantly...... had to buy a new one.
3.0,"Smaller than expected, but cute."
3.0,When I wear this to work it loosens up throughout the day. The magnet is not super strong.
3.0,Very cute dress but you'll need to size up if you have a curvier frame.  I'm 5'4 and 134 lbs but I have a butt so the dress fits but is a little more snug in the butt area.
3.0,I didn't receive the top as pictured. I gave it to my mother in law.
3.0,Color isn’t right
3.0,Came just a little small.. Still fit in gf ears but has to wear nothing prior to wearing these so they wont fall out
3.0,Giving three stars because the company still makes this item.  The feel is not as soft and satiny as I had hoped.  Some slight damage.
3.0,was not the color I expected. still wearing it though. :)
3.0,I returned mine. Product is very soft and seamless but seems to run small. I am normally a waist size of 0-2 and these in a small were snug. All the reviews I had read said they did not &#34;ride up&#34;.  Granted I did try these on over another pair of my seamless undies (as it would be gross not to). This was not the case for me. Most may love this product but was not for me.
3.0,"I ordered a S, I;m 125 lbs. They fit baggy, but not too baggy that it looks bad. If they had smaller sizes I would have order XS.<br /> The material is super cheap! It doesn't feel like your wearing clothes, might not survive after 3 washes. But it looks nicer than expected."
3.0,I ordered the same size in a different style shirt but same designer and the other shirt fits great but this one is small.
3.0,Very very very thin socks.
3.0,The cubes are a good size and fit a lot of items however the zippers are of cheap quality and break easily.<br />Wouldn't recommend.
3.0,"This does not hold a lot, can not have checkbook, and money in it at same time or clasp doesn't work."
3.0,Not as cute as I thought but it’s ok
3.0,came ontime good!
3.0,Smaller than expected and shipping cost 38.00 to receive expedited.  It still took two weeks
3.0,"The face that it was inexpensive is a plus. Other than that, it's just OK......"
3.0,"For the price, its a nice pair of sunglasses."
3.0,They are to heavy for me.
3.0,The product is good I only gave it three stars because it took a very long time to arrive to my house
3.0,Small even in a full size bigger. Pinky folds. Needs to be bigger across the top
3.0,"Hope this is listening by Seiko. They release the Seiko mini Turtle, has a precision according to the spec., black case with in an excellent size, comfortable size with no too much weight and volume, easy to read at night. But let me tell you, I DO NOT RECOMMEND to buy this watch at this time. Why?<br />For an exceptional watch like this, Seiko has released this watch using a bracelet that you can lose the watch easy, easy. This rubber strap is flexible but doesn't have any security, and because is flexible and made out of rubber, it can come out of your wrist like nothing. How come Seiko doesn't have in the market a black metal bracelet for this watch, and the worst, nobody has one. Besides this, let me tell you, NO ONE 20 mm black metal bracelet in the market, fit this watch, I have tried three, including from Strapcode.com. This watch without a black metal bracket is for just three stars. Be careful if you buy it, you can lose it. Seiko today  is becoming too commercial, even that they are still good manufacturer."
3.0,"I felt like the top looked a little maternity-ish, so I'm returning it. Also, its not cotton at all, it's a weird polyester material. It doesn't breathe at all, very warm."
3.0,Somewhat larger than most (L) sized shirts I have.
3.0,The bathing suit is beautiful but the top is far to big circumference wise!!! I ordered a  size up and got a large and while the bottoms fit VERY snug the top is extremely large. I was worried about this as i never purchase a bikini set because of this issue. I could return it but ill just keep it since i like the bottoms.
3.0,"It fits prefect for me and it didn’t rip easy. However, the white bow part of one of the socks turned little yellow which I think it means it’s kind of old(?). Hopefully, people won’t notice it when I wear it."
3.0,This is a great case but it won't fit in your pocket. The quality is very good. Great for a women's purse but not a mans pocket!
3.0,to see through
3.0,"We purchased this in two colors size xs. The black one fit well but this red colored one was too big and fits strangely as it was fitted on the chest, but was too baggy in the abdomen area. For reference, 5ft, 110 lbs. Wear size 3/4 jeans and xs or s in most bodysuits."
3.0,Cute. Was given as a gift but she never wore. Wish I saved my money
3.0,too small. -.-
3.0,...the finish/paint is beginning to flake off. Disappointed that I now have to pay to have them refinished after only 6 months of casual wear. Would have given them 5 stars if not for this issue. Buyer beware!
3.0,"They look exactly like the picture, yay! But they did not come with the lens cloth or bag. So they get a lower score for false advertising"
3.0,"This dress is soft and comfortable, however, not very flattering. I will just wear it around the house."
3.0,"Updated (September 2019): As time went on, I found myself not wanting to wear these more often than not. I recently had another baby and have decided to throw these out. Bravado nursing tanks have the length and impeccable fit that I desired. Though they're much more expensive, I would only buy them from here on out.<br /><br />Original (March 2017): I searched everywhere for affordable nursing tanks. Finally looked on Amazon, and found these. I typically wear a medium, but if I were to buy these again, I would purchase a large. It is pretty tight around the bust. The stomach is of high quality spandex, which I loved after having a baby.<br /><br />I am 5'10"", and this tank rides up a fair amount. Not sure that the larger size would prevent this."
3.0,I am a little disappointed as I thought I would receive one boy and one girl. Instead I received two boys.
3.0,"The ring came quickly, showed up exactly as described, but the metal irritates my skin.  I don't usually have any skin sensitivities to low-cost metals, but this turned my belly piercing red, swollen, and painful.  I rinsed with saltwater and used bacitracinon my skin and on the piercing to get back to normal, cleaned the jewelry using rubbing alcohol, and then put it back in.  The piercing got irritated again within a day.  I switched to an old belly ring of mine from Spencer's and I haven't had a problem since.  Something about this metal or paint must be causing the irritation.  It is cute, but if you have sensitive skin this is not the jewelry for you.  I'll still wear this ring for short periods of time if my belly is going to show, but this won't be an every day ring for me."
3.0,Runs very small<br /><br />Every pattern is a different style. You cannot easily chose a style and then find a color or print that works.
3.0,the actual pendent itself is alright i guess :p but the chains are so cheap and thin and short! it was struggling for me to put on the necklace myself because i couldnt see it well. So if you are thinking of buying this then make sure you have good chains of your own.
3.0,Returned ... Not the fit or quality I expected.
3.0,They have a odor to them so you need to wash first. They're comfortable and stretchy. A pair was torn.
3.0,I loved them but they run very small and after only washing and wearing one time there are very large holes in the lace. Very disappointed
3.0,"The bottom fit fine, but the top was tight, and really difficult to get my arms through. Infact, my arms were sore trying to get through the arm holes. You almost have to be a contortionist to be able to get the bathing suit on. I don't think they thought this through when making this. I was really looking forward to getting this swimsuit for my swim class, but if its difficult to put on dry, I can imagine how difficult it will be to remove when it's wet after swimming. Really disappointed. I should have ordered one with adjustable straps I guess..."
3.0,it's ok does what is intended for.
3.0,Bought for my 8 yr old and it was uncomfortable for her to wear . Was too tight
3.0,"Not as flowy as it looks and the arms are a little short compared to the body, but overall a cute shirt"
3.0,I have just enough room for my toes but the shoe fits a little bit narrow. Hopefully wearing them with thinner socks will help stretch them out a little
3.0,The designs are very cute but they quickly fall off and get stuck in my daughters hair. Quickly disappointing.
3.0,It’s very very very thick and hard to breathe in it
3.0,Pretty colors. Length great. A little big. Default in workmanship of material. Had tiny pieces of cotton throughout out the material.<br />Disappointed.  Bought 4 pair all same size andcone was too small.
3.0,Runs large and the material is scratchy
3.0,I thought this would be a casual shirt but it looks like a glorified t-shirt. Disappointed
3.0,"adorable and comfy.  nice and warm and love they are waterproof, but the get really dirty super fast.  They look SO OLD already."
3.0,"The blouse would've been exactly what I needed if it weren't for the upper sleeves being excruciatingly tight. Also, under the armpit area it was down kind've uneven. The rest of the blouse was great.  Sadly had to return it because one can't wear something that will cut off circulation."
3.0,"It fits as expected, looks nice, lighter weight.  The lining in the hood is white and stands out and looks odd.  I'm trying to decide if I will keep it because I like the fit and the style, but that hood lining really detracts from the look.  Pulling the hood tight and tying in keeps the white from showing so I may keep it."
3.0,"First I want to say I had zero issue with the seller. Item arrived on time and in perfect shape.<br /><br />Now the bad:<br />Watch worked great for the first 6 months or so. Then slowly started losing time. Factory spec says 30 seconds or so across 24 hours is max error. Mine started well within spec, then got progressively worse. Losing up to 5 minutes in 24 hours of constant wear. Then degraded to the point it will just stop for a hour at a time even with hand winding. I contacted Seiko service and was told there is currently no option for repair due to the Corona virus. I understand the virus has affected them. It has affected all of us. However, a global company like Seiko should have a way to make it right even during these times. Maybe replacement vs repair until their service center is open. I expect there is going to be a very long back log when / if they open the service center so I basically have a $300 paper weight. I'll be buying a replacement from a different brand."
3.0,"I will say I do like the look and the underside being a more waterproof material, however, the overall quality is only so-so and it's already starting to fall apart."
3.0,Really pretty but for the price the seams shouldn't unravel after a couple days.
3.0,These hurt when trying to take them off from the second piercing on the lobe. And didn't like the way it felt putting them on. But aesthetically looked good.
3.0,Cute small sequins- sewn on tightly and no gaps between them. Nice styling- hem is longer in the back than in the front. Shirt is VERY see through though. Anything over $12.00 is too much for the quality of the shirt. Ultimately returned it.
3.0,"This hat is beautiful, with wonderful materials.  But its not a universal size.  The internal band will bite into any normal man's head size, rendering it unwearable for more than a couple of minutes before the pain sets in.  I wanted it for myself but had to give it to my kids. Maybe you could slice the internal band to relieve pressure."
3.0,This is a small compact kit really more suited for travel than regular use. It works but I was disappointed in the size. Should have read the description more.
3.0,Cute sweater but ran small got a size up and still was to small for my daughter.
3.0,I really like the style of these jeans. The denim is a bit thin with a soft feel.  My only concern is the left leg hole on the thigh hits a bit too high and you can see some stuff.  So I gifted these to my friend and her legs a just a bit thicker and filled the jeans out quite nicely and only her legs can be seen....nothing else. I don't think these will work if you think they'll fit you loosely on the thighs.
3.0,"Great looking watch, with a great band. I would have given it 5 stars due to the quality in relation to price.  I am not doing so as it arrived not functioning, probably just a dead battery. That should have been obvious when shipping if they did  QC prior. Obviously did not, returning is a pain for a 20 dollar item hopefully a new battery will fix issue. Amazon has been slipping recently in delivering products that are not dinged up or actually working."
3.0,"Very cute, but small. Order up."
3.0,Perfect for gardening in.
3.0,Didn't take the time to really read the description and didn't realize this is just a sort of laminated paper/plastic coated tote.  It's nice but probably wouldn't have spent the $10 on this had I realized what it is.
3.0,"They come unhitched too easy, and i lose the gem.  I have better luck with pushins."
3.0,"The fabric is a bit cheap, but the dress does fit as expected.  Fits and looks best with a good foundation garment and slip."
3.0,"I bought these to use with a pair of screw-back earrings that I could no longer put on by myself, thinking they would be secure...I've now lost one earring and one back.  Not so very secure after all.  😕"
3.0,"This is a nice dress that I ultimately returned because the style was a bit too matronly for me. I am in my late 20's and thought it looked feminine and pretty in the pictures, but I just found that it looked far too old for me! I do recommend this for older women - the fabric is very comfortable, it drapes well and is quite flattering. The pockets are a fun plus, and I think the sleeves are also a nice detail. With the high neckline, long hemline and overall look, though, it just did not seem age appropriate for me."
3.0,The imgae isn't the greatest but it fits according to size and it's cute enough to wear around the house when I clean and just relax. I won't order another as the image quality isn't the best.
3.0,"I like the soft fabric, nice and light for summer days. I only rated a 3 due to the hem of the blouse. The front right portion is not straight with the rest of the seam, it is like a bubble or a speedbump. Not sure what happened during the production of this top but I really hope it was hilarious. Will need to have the seam fixed to be able to wear out."
3.0,"Legs ride up and defeats purpose of using to prevent chub rub. I liked the cotton crotch and overall seamless design, but the length and fit of the legs needs some work here."
3.0,The vneck (neckline) is very deep and was unexpected. I did not feel comfortable wearing it out of the house and was unable to find a suitable match for a cami or bralette for extra coverage. The rest of the dress was well made.
3.0,"I thought, for certain, this’d be the perfect addition to my lounge-y wardrobe. Alas, the SMALL was enormous; and, I wear a 12. Afraid of tripping over the swath of fabric, the caftan was returned"
3.0,Really can't stand to have these on my feet for too long.  Have sensitive feet and feel like walking on toothpicks.  Definitely not for me.
3.0,"The style and material are nice but it fits too snug. I order 10.5, which is my usual size and my toes felt cramped. Also the neck around my ankle was chafing. Probably should have ordered a size up."
3.0,"I really want to give this wallet five stars, but it's got a fatal flaw.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great wallet with an ingenious solution to holding cash along with an easy to access card case.  The quality of the case and the internal card holders seems to be very good and durable.  Also, the small size and the smooth but not slick finish on the outside of the case make it comfortable in the hand and the pocket.<br /><br />Here's the problem:  The clasp that holds the wallet closed is made of a hard plastic that doesn't seem up to the job.  Even though Sharkk redesigned the wallet a few years ago to fix clasp issues (previous versions used an internal clasp that broke often), the new clasp design doesn't seem durable enough to withstand continued opening an closing stresses.  The clasp seems to last about two to three months of regular use before breaking.<br /><br />Here's the current solution:  I have to admit that despite the issues with the clasp, Sharkk wallets come with a lifetime warranty.  I've invoked it once and will be invoking it again now that my current wallet's clasp is starting to crack.  Their customer service is very responsive (hence the three stars), but I wish they'd fix the clasp problem for good."
3.0,I didn't care for the material. The print is African but not the fabric. The design is nice.
3.0,"Pros: Quality materials, great reflectiveness<br /><br />Cons: You have to be exactly the right measurements. There is no elastic in the cuffs nor the bottom of the coat. I am used to sleeves being too long but something to hold them in place would have been nice. The bottom of the coat was flowy and would allow for a breeze to get in easy. Not ideal for running in Wisconsin so I returned the item."
3.0,"The cups and hooks are the only part of this bra to help give any support. While it is very pretty and light weight, the material holding it all together is just thin nylon fabric."
3.0,"For the price, it's okay. Nice color and looks like leather. The purse doesn't stand up like it should. But you get what you pay for."
3.0,does stretch though
3.0,"Smaller than I expected. Still deciding if I will keep it or return it.  May keep it for a date night purse. Good, quality purse. Just too small for my taste."
3.0,"I am heavy in the chest and this dress, while it looked cute elsewhere, would not zip up over my chest.  If there were and XL, I would totally buy it."
3.0,These skinny jeans fit somewhat smaller than the same size boot cut jeans I purchased. The skinny jeans are much tighter through the hips than the same sized Wallflower boot cut jeans I purchased.
3.0,"the seam in the middle which joins both pieces is out of place. Fits kind of funny. Will prob never wear, will just donate."
3.0,The slippers are pretty and true to the look but the hole to put foot in is small if child has fat foot its going to be hard to get foot in I notice the size is a little bit small by half inch inside not soft material like outside can easily get aggravating to the child when it rubs on there feet my girls ages 3&4 put them on and off all time because of feeling
3.0,"I love the design a lot. I've been collecting beach theme accessories. However the quality is not so good.<br />The bottom two small shells are really cute. But the shorter shell choker is made of plastic. Like very obvious plastic. Especially the back of it. So when I wear the necklaces, unless I don't move too much or turn my head, the plastic shells won't stay flat and will flip to the ugly plastic side. I wore it for a few hours and had to check myself multiple times to adjust it."
3.0,"This bralette is definitely more for smaller chested women. I was looking for a more elegant coverage for a wedding but it didn't work out too well, but it is very cute, definitely would wear on a nice out but not at a family gathering."
3.0,"I am glad I sized up by one size from my typical measurements. If I had bought my original size, I would have suffocated. 1 star deducted because of the sizing issue. 1 star deducted for not coming with pads even though there are slot for inserts ."
3.0,"The coat is super cute, I ordered a size up from what i normally wear and it goes perfectly.  The main problems I noticed was with the sewing, lots of loose strings and there was a hole in the bottom left pocket first thing.  I noticed there's a hole inside the left sleeve now too. I've only been wearing it for two weeks. it is really cute and I'm still going to wear it but it's definitely not worth the money I spent on it."
3.0,"It’s great, and i love it a lot, but you DEFINITELY cannot wear it for longer than an hour at a time"
3.0,these pants  are extremely comfortable yet the fabric is cheap and a hole tore in them very easily.
3.0,"Son un poco delgado, no me gusto mucho y luego se le cae a mi hijo ."
3.0,These are much more &#34;sweatpant style&#34; than they appear in the photo (where they look like cute little leggings) and much larger than we'd expected.
3.0,"Cute, cheap, what more could you ask for? I will say, of course, you get what you pay for. I broke one just by sneezing with it on, so be careful with them! Also, these are absolutely not made for women with thicker necks; I just barely fit into them myself and I think my neck is roughly 13&#34; around. Overall, the double layers were super cute and cheap. I would consider buying again."
3.0,Have not used them yet but not having any problems with the locks
3.0,"I was very impressed with the quality of the glasses.  They are very nice.  But there were no instructions...that I could find...on what strength to order.  I wear trifocals now and I have a different pair for when I am on my computer.  So, I ordered 3x.  I don't know if I need less or more.  They are extraordinarily blurry and did not work at all for me.  I simply don't have time to do more homework so I returned them.  The return process is super easy.  Just take them back to a participating Kohls. I would probably give them 3.5 to 4 stars."
3.0,"They run on the small side, so get a size bigger"
3.0,"They are on the small side for adults and very thin, but they are better than nothing at all, and you don't sweat like with the blue generic ones.  They are just OK."
3.0,"I like my fedora, but it was shipped in a bag.  The hat was crushed, thus the reason for 3 stars.  Hats, by nature, should be shipped in a box!"
3.0,Does not have a pocket for a filter
3.0,kind of gaudy - look more plasticy in person than in the pciture.
3.0,The slipper itself is very pretty but the signs on lines has a large is a 7.5 - 8.5 us the actual bottom of the slipper shows that a large is 9.5 to 10 so it is way too big the size is not listed correctly on the website.
3.0,Overall bag is ok. Compartments are good and well placed. Major downside is that 2 zippers broke within 2 months. Maybe it was just my bag with defective zippers. Who knows. Would purchase again IF zippers were upgraded to better quality.
3.0,Product does not look like the picture
3.0,"I should have known what I would be getting from the image, I suppose, but it boils down to one pair of silver and one pair of black earrings, plus one spare of each.  Doesn't make much sense to me.  If you just want a single spiral, you'll buy a single spiral.  Anyone buying a pack like this probably wants more than one, and will want to coordinate.  I read the item description saying ""black anodized"" and assumed they would all come in black."
3.0,"This is losing feathers after 2 uses, the string on the storage bag came apart after a couple uses, and the jacket isn’t very long. We hammock camp and i wanted to sleep in this but it creeps up. I hike all the time and wear outer wear constantly. This one is cheap and I don’t recommend. :/"
3.0,This fit me a little bit loosely and long.
3.0,These earrings are very heavy but still beautiful!
3.0,"Nice, warm, fluffy.  Had to reorder...first order too small."
3.0,"Nice for the price, i wouldnt recommended them for anyone that even has a slightly wide head tho. My head isnt even that big(wear size 7 1/4 helmet/medium motorcycle helmet) and they squeeze my head and give me a headache. I wish they had more give to them so they wouldnt squeeze so tight. Cute style tho"
3.0,It's a nice foam bow. But upon arrival both ends were broke off and did not feel like returning for replacement. Makes a good toy for my boys but that's about it.
3.0,Not too bad for a price<br />For some reason where to adjust strap length there black line on all 4 straps<br />Over all not too bad made only 3 stars
3.0,"The bag is well made and nice, however the center pocket for tablet etc.bis to flimsy and to low in the bag. There is no protection for the tablet and being in the center of the bag it is very difficult to access, so if you are wanting this for tablet carry I would not recommend it.<br />As a general purse very nice for the money."
3.0,"Does what I need it to do, but the gold plate wore off the clasp very quickly."
3.0,"Slippers run small. Not a terrible slipper, nothing special"
3.0,I was hoping for something light weight and loose. The material is thick and holds heat. Great for below zero weather.
3.0,"The material is very stiff, but I'm sure it would soften with washing. It fit well around the waist but barely fit over my hips. Just not comfortable so I returned it. This would work for you if you don't have wide hips compared to your waist size. I weigh 140lbs. My waist is 33 and hips are 39.  Order a medium, but I think large would be too baggy."
3.0,"These are fairly nice, but they are a bit too thick to be used and passed off as real piercings. In your ears you may be able to pass it off, but I personally wouldn't recommend trying it for lips (way too big) or nose (because once it's in, it's very hard to get it to come out since the little flat part catches on the end of your nose inside.)"
3.0,"It’s a nice mask, just smaller than what I thought."
3.0,"Just what I expected, satisfied my needs."
3.0,It’s see through but pretty
3.0,This is supposed to be for kids and it is adult sized.
3.0,Purchased these for a gift for my mom who is moving to another state little disappointed in the quality one of the butterflies wings isn’t even Fully covered in glitter. Mine broke in a day definitely Will not order again .
3.0,"This jacket is very stylish. My son gets compliments every time he wears it. The problem is, it's starting to fall apart. Both flowers are peeling off. And I purchased it a short 6 weeks ago.  I'm going to stitch the decals back on but sheesh I should not have too."
3.0,"Loved the print, but it is way to big!"
3.0,"These are soft and lightweight, but they run pretty large and are fairly unflattering. The picture makes them look like cute booty shorts and they could be if you buy a size down from your usual size. For reference, I'm 5'5"", approx 127 lbs, and ordered a medium."
3.0,The earrings are cute but the black pair has uneven tassel and I won’t be able to wear them. But $8.99 for 3 pair of earrings isn’t worth the hassle for me to return
3.0,"Cute design but the fabric is rough, not soft for my baby. I got this for a cheaper price compared to the real junpei from Japan so I can't complain about the material."
3.0,Not for busty woman
3.0,So short!!!
3.0,"The hemline below the chest was a little uneven on me, it sagged in the middle so you could see there were pockets underneath on both sides.  You could see something, i assumed it hung that way because of the weight of the pockets even when empty.  I think that's because its a little big.  I'm really more of a 0-2, I guess that would be an XS which was not an option.  I am 5'7&#34; 115 lbs, 32 C. Maybe this would be a better fit for someone who is a bit more curvy, I'm pretty slender.  The small doesn't fit but I tried it on late and missed the return deadline.  Waiting on the seller to see if I can return.  The fabric is decent but its not nearly as thick or substantial as it looks in pictures.  I would not recommend, it looks more like a $20 dress than $30 which you pay, or $60 like the pictures."
3.0,"For the price this dress is very cute. The cut just didn’t work for me. The sleeves were too long (which isn’t unusual for me). The waist seemed a little too high so I feel like it added bulk around my waist because of the flair style. And I do have a bigger chest and the legs was a bit tight. I’m 5’0”, 156 and a 38DD and ordered a large. Since its a free easy return I’d say give it a try, but it just didn’t work for my body."
3.0,"The brim could be a little wider. Also, they are made for smaller children 8 and younger."
3.0,Material is ok but very nice
3.0,GOOD BUT TOO SMALL !!!!!!!!!!
3.0,Shoulder elastic band is uncomfortable. Too tight but the rest of the fit is fine.
3.0,Order 2 sizes up. Way to small. Measurements off
3.0,"Very thin material is quite see through, which would probably be fine if it were a darker color and the day was not too bright. It will be ok with a long slip. Dimensions are not true to size chart, the dress is short. Definitely buy up one size if you are over 5'5"", but the bust fits as expected.<br /><br />Edit: I also bought this dress in navy from the same seller and that dress is true to size, long enough and the bust fits well, still thin material, but not see-through due to the better fit and darker color, so it feels nice and lightweight. I cannot explain why the yellow seems to be one size smaller than the navy when they are both marked as Large, but I have decided that maybe the yellow dress I got was mismarked, some kind of fluke."
3.0,This wasn't a choker necklace but its still cute .Isn't metal like I thought it would be
3.0,Doesn't fit well. The elastic headband wrinkles and causes pain and pressure marks on my forehead. I wear a 7-1/2 hat size and the L/XL does not fit. Bummer...
3.0,The ones that worked were cute. But about 1/3 disnt light up but kids still liked the rings
3.0,"These would have been good but they were just not long enough, they kept slipping down all day long."
3.0,Quality is fine but sleeves are too short for me. If they were a few inches longer I would have kept it. Returning this item.
3.0,"Cute, but cheap finish comes off a little every time it gets wet. Sad to find out some of the finish came off after my shower. But very cute looking, just take out for shower and swimming."
3.0,"I love Bernie Mev shoes but these did not work for me, they were too open and my toes slid around and off the side so I had to return.  My friend has them and she loves them.  So it is just individual preference and how they fit your foot.  A bit disappointing but the others I ordered were all perfect.<br /><br />Quick tip, when I order open toe Bernie Mev's I get size 39, when I order close toe I order size 40.<br /><br />I am a USA size 8 and when I order open toe in Bernie Mev I order size 39."
3.0,They are really cute but didn’t come with backs? So now I have to find earring backs in order to wear them.
3.0,"Ok for the price, but super thin and see through."
3.0,I love the fit and feel of these leggings but mine arrived with a marking all the way down the front which I didn’t notice until I had already taken the tag off :(
3.0,Brim is a little too wide.
3.0,Es mas pequeño de la talla promedio
3.0,"Unfortunately, this one isn't for me. It's not a super comfortable fabric, it's see through, and when I put it on, it seems the length of it just keeps stretching. It stretches so far down that it could be worn as a dress. The fabric goes well below my bottom, almost to my mid thigh at full length and I just don't like the fit, stretch, or fabric. I sized down to a medium from my usual large in a top, but it's ultra stretchy. It might be good for other attire, but not as everyday casual tank wear."
3.0,The wallet is fat.
3.0,"Did not block the sun so well, just made things darker. Not what you need for tennis."
3.0,Very cute! I am a size 12/14. I bought a XL and it was too small. The XL size was not long enough to cuff and I am 5ft 7in. The pants came down to above my ankles. I have returned the item and will buy a 3XL instead. I thought the material was nice. The pockets are large and the belt feature is very cute.
3.0,"This is really light turquoise, not green as it appears on the screen. Cute top, but once again terribly thin fabric. Seriously, we don't want to wear tops that show our bras, and it loses the point of a nice top if you have to wear a cami under it. Cheap fabric is driving me away from buying clothes on Amazon in the future -- I used to buy a lot."
3.0,"Stretched out,and now it falls off my arm."
3.0,"For the price, I expected a little better.  Ordered champagne but they look more like rose gold.  The posts were bent as well.  Maybe I just got a bad pair?"
3.0,The material doesn't really breath and makes my baby's feet sweaty. I think it's synthetic. They slip off constantly.  But they are adorable colors.
3.0,Cute but definitely very tiny. Hopefully they last a while and don’t tarnish.
3.0,Bigger than I expected.  Too bog for readers. But overall ok.
3.0,"They are very hard to get on and off! They feel fine once they're on, but getting them on is extremely hard!! Getting them off is hard as well!"
3.0,"These glasses are exactly as advertised. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of plastic used,  instead of being thin and flimsy it is sturdy and will hold up after time.<br />The lenses are not as dark as i was hoping They would be. You can still see my eyeballs when im wearing the glasses.<br />For use as fashion glasses they are super cute, for sunglasses i wish they were darker."
3.0,The jacket overall looks nice but the material is very cheaply made. It’s thin and the zipper hardly works. Also it runs one size small. I’m usually a medium but probably should’ve gotten a large
3.0,"Nice heavy bracelet , I'm a female but wanted a more chunky look so that's why I ordered a men's, sometimes the womans sizes run small, but all in all this was a good purchase for the money. Recommend to buy."
3.0,"Absolutely love this dress, been watching for awhile and finally purchased as a gift. Unfortunately, it was too small, it was the given to my sister and she loves it. The colors pop even more in person, the photos do not do it justice. The pics do however, give an accurate example of the dress. Just remember buyer beware, this dress runs super small, order two sizes larger, especially if you have large breasts."
3.0,Bracelet is pretty and durable.  Shipping time is terrible
3.0,"Waited a long time to receive it.I got it and its pretty,but have no idea what it spells??"
3.0,Not what I thought it was...it's not structured as it looks in the pictures. Its floppy. Gave it to my wife.
3.0,Love the hat but it could have been just a little smaller. Next time I'll try another company.  O WELL~~~
3.0,Not a great quality and the fit is a little off
3.0,"The quality for this product is Okay, but it is not good for the real cold weather like Chicago area. The hat is not deep enough, so cannot cover all neck skin, need to wear with the high neck overcoat."
3.0,"The shoes themselves are gorgeous and fit exactly right but they were definitely made cheap. My sister and I both have a pair and they are both peeling apart. The rubber sole of the heels peel off from the rest of the heel extremely easy. I only wore mine once and they were peeled away from the heels. And the entire heal is already peeling off of the rest of the shoes after only wearing them 4 times. I work as a receptionist so the walking I do is minimal, and they are still peeling apart. Gorgeous shoe. Crappy job making them. DON'T wear these on a night out on the town."
3.0,Cheap but cute!
3.0,"Wouldn’t recommend if your over a C cup, not made for a heavier top half. I’m 155 & I wear a medium, ordered a L for chest coverage. Top still didn’t fit. Keep skirt and buying my own top"
3.0,Maybe I am too picky. I have several neck gators that are comfortable and are cut differently so my biggest problem with these are they seem smaller than the others I have. They fit very tight around my mouth and nose. Just very uncomfortable for me and I can't wear them. Maybe I just have a big head.
3.0,"I love the band itself. It's thinner than the band that the watch comes with and fits nicely. I don't however, like the watch face protector. It doesn't fit very well and the dial on the watch doesn't turn because of it."
3.0,Has not been worn. Was bought as a gender reveal part dress and the party didn’t happen.
3.0,Sleeves are slightly shorter than expected
3.0,Super cute but its made of that fake leather that is easily destroyed.
3.0,"Was the perfect little dress........until I tried it on. Fit nice on top but ..... so oddly shaped in the hips. Looked like someone stretched out the hips. Looked like a totally different size than on top. Very dissatisfied. Would have returned, but misplaced the packaging."
3.0,"love the shoe and the fit, but it rubs my ankle pretty bad.  I have to put a bandade where it is rubbing to prevent blistering."
3.0,"This was my mistake again to not check if these boots had a zipper.  I have very high arches and find I cannot put on boots without a zipper.  I love the style of these CHELSEA boots plus the color and would be great for upcoming cold weather.  The decorations on the back made me think it was over a zipper but my mistake.  These are well made boots and with the stretchable elastic it should have been fine but no luck.<br /><br />As a Senior Citizen I need the low heels, so these boots looked just like something I should have for cooler weather.  I believe these boots were designed for older women but for easy of putting on and removing them a zipper would help us older women.  It was my mistake for not checking closer as my high arches have always been with me so need to check closer when ordering."
3.0,"Much smaller beads than I was expecting, but it does look very feminine, I like that it is sterling silver, and I am keeping it as the gift I had ordered for."
3.0,"I think this top is so cute I'm hoping it will fit my fat arms (lol) I plan to wear this along with a high low skirt to a celebration for my brother,l want to look cute (lol) I will be back with a Better review once I receive and wear it wish me LUCK!! So I'm giving it a three star for now because it's so cute I'll let you know how it fit."
3.0,Cute but fits small and is too short b
3.0,Product well made.  Delivery time ridiculous.  Freight charges to high.
3.0,The dress is pretty but the fabric is really rough/scratchy.
3.0,I ordered a purple dress. The dress I received was not purple. Not sure if it was a mixup or if the sites color doesn’t match with the actual material. The dress i received was more of a maroon/burgundy color. The color is still beautiful and it’s not see through so that makes me happy. Just glad I didn’t need the purple dress for a special occasion!
3.0,"It's... fine! Didn't really love it, and actually probably won't wear it, but it is fine, and the fit is great!"
3.0,"I’m undecided on this one… was excited to get it based on the photos of it on the model, but it fell short of my expectation when I tried it on. Firstly it needs a strong steaming / ironing to get the creases out which as you can see in my photo I did not do yet. The fabric is quality, buttons are quality, color is spot on, stitching also quality… but IMO it looks more like a satin sleep shirt on me than a dress.<br /><br />For size reference I got a M. I’m tall, 5’10”, 150 lbs, 36D. This probably looks super cute on shorter smaller girls, it’s just not quite right for me."
3.0,Love the mk logo font print and color the stitching  would rather have it be dark than white though
3.0,The fit is a bit tight but what really disappointed me was what happened after the first wash...the shirt apparently wasn’t cut correctly and once washed it “twisted”. One side seam is straight and the other curves toward the front. Looks like a very cheaply made product.
3.0,"I give 3 stars because they are totally see-thru! You must wear a long shirt or dress over the butt. Other than the see-thru issue they are very cute and comfy, they are more shimmery than I imagined them to be, but not crazily so. Overall I do like these. My belly measures 49&#34; and these do not seem to dig into my fat in any kind of unusual way. I have not worn them for any length of time yet, I only tried them on."
3.0,"These are pretty cute. They definitely had a pretty plasticy smell, but that's to be expected.  However, the first time my daughter wore these she pulled one of the puppydog noses off - it is definitely a choking hazard for little kids."
3.0,Washed it once and quickly lost its new look fuzzed up all ove the shaw. But will keep you warm in the winter.
3.0,"They say this is a dress, it is not. It is a skirt. There is no shirt with it, attached, etc."
3.0,They look great but are very delicate. They just broke within a week.But its worth the price.
3.0,"The apron is cute and arrived as described. But it is SMALL. I'm 5'7, a size 14 and it looked ridiculous on me. I gave it to my mom. She is 5', a size 6 and it was slightly too big for her. It is better suited for a small framed woman."
3.0,Clip did not work on my glasses as well as many others have.
3.0,A lil bulkier than I imagined.. prob shoulda gone a half size smaller
3.0,It fit really snug usually a large is a bit baggy on me. Wish I would of gotten an xl
3.0,"Lights only work during the day (not useful) when the solar panel is charging. Not sure if it’s a bad battery or something else.<br />Shade and shape are great. I like the color, will see how it holds up with the sun over time.<br />Crank makes a little noise but it’s not too bad.<br /><br />Update: I was hoping the company would reach out to help fix the inoperative lights issue but they still haven’t, unfortunately. Shade is holding up well after a month but lights not functional."
3.0,"We got this as a birthday present to our 4 year old. She wears a 5/6 in every other outfit or leotard. This seems big on her legs and her arms but yet too tight and bunches between her legs no matter what you do. It doesn't just ride up, it stays like that. I can't tell if it's too big or too small or just poorly made. I could tell the second I opened it that it was really cheap fabric and bordering see through. My daughter loves the pattern though and it served it's purpose at gymnastics but had I paid more than I did for it I'd give it less stars for sure."
3.0,Cute bracelet for a keychain
3.0,"Came quicjkly, but theyre too big for nostril piercing."
3.0,"The waist was true to size however, there is absolutely no room in the crotch and the zipper is too small. The legs are too baggy and look more like a straight leg pair of jeans that the pictures show. Some altering needed to be done to make them look more modern style than some 90's style loose fitting jeans. The knee pads are low even when you're on your bike. The thighs are loose but it gives you some room to upgrade the thigh pads. Pretty decent at the price and if you can make the alterarions, they're worth it.<br /><br />The cool piece is the included padding. Good rubber knee pads and it comes with some reflective strips on the inside of the pant legs. If you flip your pant legs up while riding, it will be seen."
3.0,"Purchased this with the intention to use for snowboarding.  I have a size 30 waist but got the XL based on the strange sizing.  It's too big but not worth sending back.  I've tested it a couple of times while learning power slides on rollerblades.  Skin covered by the product gets quite warm and sweaty so it will definitely not work for full-day sessions on the mountain.  There's also a lack of padding in the hip area for some reason, right where I think it would be needed if you landed sideways.  Regardless of this I think for the price it's decent short-term protection when you want to practice moves outside of your normal envelope.  I think this product has potential but needs to be made of breathable or sweat-wicking material."
3.0,"It’s OK, but after one wash it was less than OK. PS I washed it and cold and hung it"
3.0,Smaller than expected. I’m a size 9.5 and when they do stay on they hurt my toes.
3.0,Love .it is good
3.0,wrinkles baby after washing
3.0,"It really looks pretty, but it doesn't hold very much. And if your items are put in wrong, it gaps at the top between the black bag and the silver top. It's not attractive when it does that. I had credit cards and my driver's license, a lipstick, an asthma inhaler and just my car keys and it all didn't fit well into the purse. I do like that it came with a shoulder chain and a handle. I have small hands and it was uncomfortable to use as a clutch. I used the shoulder strap and I was glad for it.  It's really a nice looking purse, I just wish I had had a little bit more room."
3.0,Color is very off but it worked i guess.  But if youre looking for specific colors dont trust the coloring in photo diaplay.
3.0,Fits as expected. Its really cheap and fits me awkward. Soft material.
3.0,The item was very cute.  However I thought that they were juniors sizes
3.0,these work for a quick picture or for a dress up party or halloween. But they are not very comfortable.
3.0,The outside of the glove is waterproof and works great BUT water can get inside the glove via the  glove opening around the wrist.  It would be much better if there was some kind of water proof cinch or Velcro to prevent water from getting it or perhaps a tight rubber seal (like dry suits have) to prevent water from getting inside the glove.
3.0,These are okay glasses. I have had them for awhile and when looking at some screens the glasses seem to give off a glare. The frames look stylish.
3.0,pink color was very pale not as shown nice snug fit not too short.  I am 5'6&#34; 119 small worked.
3.0,These looked great for a couple weeks but they scratch very easily!
3.0,"If your looking for a layered necklace that is all attached together, then you will be disappointed as each necklace is separate. It came all tangled together and  after I untangled them, I was surprised that there was three separate necklace!  I am sure that I will wear them all together or separate! (if I don't lose them)  😊"
3.0,The material was much thinner than I was expecting and was similar to a pajama pant. I would suggest going a size down in the pant. They run large and long.
3.0,I love the way this band looks. But it has fallen off several times. It doesn't stay clasped. I'm afraid I will lose the fitbit some day. Updatr: slipped off my wrist yesterday so fitbit is now gone...
3.0,Looked great but just didn't fit as expected
3.0,Magnets fell out within the first week. The part that holds the magnets began to turn a different color after a couple days of wear
3.0,"Liked the shape, but didn't like that you can see my eyes through the glass."
3.0,Sunglasses are what I expected and look nice & fit my face structure. They are sturdy and I'm pleased with the shade it provides from the sun.
3.0,Not too great hat but can be used in little cold weather especially during spring and fall season. Cannot be used for extreme cold temperatures.
3.0,little small for xxl
3.0,"Straps too long, I'll have to alter by an inch or so. Inconvenient. Otherwise, cute and nice, lined... But adjustable straps would make it the correct length and fit bust better."
3.0,"Pricey, the stitches are not that straight and not that high quality for the price expected."
3.0,why not in sizes?
3.0,It was pretty and wore it with my costume. But it was way long and the hood wouldn’t say on my head.
3.0,"It is what I ordered, but didn't look good on me and I didn't like the straps. Material is not the best feel."
3.0,I liked the shirt but it runs WAY small.. I ordered a 2XL and it fit like a medium .... I am so disappointed
3.0,This is really cute but it runs really small and the material is extremely cheap almost like doll clothes
3.0,Hermosa tela y estampado.<br />DEMASIADO GRANDE PARA ser médium!!! Habría que mandarla arreglar
3.0,I wanted it because  it came down a little farther. But the extra on the bottom of it just rolls up.  But other than that it’s super comfortable.
3.0,"Heavy and large, but it's handy for all your stuff. Didn't take long to start fraying."
3.0,"Very cute fabric & design, but it’s see-through & the hips fit tight; no stretch."
3.0,"They are cute, yes but the inserts are completely the wrong size. Not even matching wrong size and won't even stay in that are so small. But for the price and I really just needed them for a photo shoot so.....not all that bad for a toddler who will grow out of them in 2 months anyways."
3.0,Not the best it’s more of a plastic then fabric
3.0,Socks are comfy but boy do the Devils stink. Go Flyers!!!
3.0,Hard to get on so I finally gave up. They are maybe just too small fro my old hands. Their quality is excellent. Gave to my grand daughter.
3.0,"There's only two bulbs in this pad, so the lighting isn't great.  And they will burn out because there are no resistors pu in line during the engineering and manufacturing process to prevent this.<br /><br />But I simply used a soldering iron to lightly burn out the recesses where the original OEM bulbs were to make room for new ones purchased at Radio Shack and soldered in 1k resistors in line and so far, very bright lighting with no burnouts.<br /><br />I understand that although this was simple for me, it may not be for everyone, or even for those that understand the repair technology used, may not want to bother with this exercise.  In any case, there's the review and the choice to purchase on this item is a personal matter because I can't pass that judgement on due to what I had to do to make the pads worth it for me.<br /><br />The way I look at it, for the money spent, if the pad lights hold out, then you're ahead of the game.  If not, then either you lose or spend a few pennies at Radio Shack and make it a product you initially liked and will then be able to keep for a very long time.  And, to boot, once modified as I did, is rebuildable for the future, which extends its lifespan even more.<br /><br />To purchase or not purchase is a very personal and subjective matter for this item, so you're not going to get that from me here on this one this time."
3.0,The colors are great but they are very stiff and don't drape/ hang well.<br />Also the rubber ends aren't very tight and glasses can't be secured even with both suggestions given in description.
3.0,"Overall I liked everything about this dress, except that the waist scooped down in the front and back, rather than being straight across. This was very unflattering for an hourglass figure and I couldn't pair any belt with it to hide it as it dipped well below my natural waistline. If that doesn't bother you, or you have a very long torso this might be right for you, but for me it wasn't flattering enough to keep.<br /><br />For reference I'm 5'4"", 175-180lbs athletic/curvy. I ordered a large (chest 43"", waist 31"", hips 44""). It was actually a little bit larger in the chest than I expected (I don't wear padded bras) and a bit tighter in the hips than I preferred, but it did fit true to size."
3.0,"Had a pair of these for a few years and loved them, until I snagged them on something, resulting in a hole. Decided to order a new pair but the material is different. It feels cheap and is starting to pill after a few wears. Plus they’re a little on the short side. Bummer."
3.0,Stylish but I had a reaction to the metal.
3.0,"Very cute. Ordered a small but it is a little big. Not so big that I need to return it, but I'll probably need a belt to give it more shape and make it less boxxy. The quality is fine. Not the best, not the worst."
3.0,"The fabric is really flimsy, but at least it does not wrinkle at all.  It is very comfortable, but needs to be worn with a belt or it just looks like a sack on my 5foot 4 inch frame. For the price, I can't complain"
3.0,"Although it is a nice material and very pretty, it is very snug.  If purchasing get a couple of sizes larger.  Due to the material, there is no give whatsoever."
3.0,"Maybe I should have gone with a bigger size, but the Briefery Men's 100% women cotton Classic Boxers seem a size too small. I like the patterns and designs of the boxers, but it's a tight fit, so tight that the fly tends to just stay open (and there are no buttons to keep it closed). The material is a bit thin as well, which isn't necessarily a deal-breaker (especially if you live in warmer climates), but it's hard to recommend anything when the sizing is off. If you must, order a size up."
3.0,Unfortunately I had to send this back. It fit tighter across the chest than anywhere else. I bought it in a medium and a large to see which one would fit and neither one did. Strange sizing
3.0,"material runs small, order a size up"
3.0,It's ok is right....not great as it does run a bit small...I am 5'8&#34; @ 120 lbs. and I ordered a large!
3.0,"The case is good at giving your Q5 key full protection. It’s a bummer the Audi logo is not embossed in the leather. The photos show that it does have it, but it actually doesn’t! It’s kind false advertising in a way... I was a bit disappointed and that’s why I am giving this product only 3 stars."
3.0,It does have the same style as the picture but the material is nothing like the one on photo. The one I got is like a stretchy material. I requested a refund and the customer service was amazing. At the end a friend loved the fit and style and decided to keep it. Will definitely try buying something else from this seller in the future.
3.0,"they are functional and a good value for the price, as you get three pair, but the material is thinner than I would like and some has started to fray up around the faces of the animals. I still wear them, and probably no one sees it but me."
3.0,Beautiful set wore it once and one of the studs came out of earring.
3.0,Diferente el diseño de la tela.
3.0,Cut is small
3.0,"My daughter picked this out. The photo on Amazon was small and she didn't realize the logo on front was in camouflage . The quality is always great with Under Armour, but we will be returning, as she does not wear camouflage!"
3.0,"Pretty good quality but as noted in headline, the hat isn't really tall enough to stay put over ears. YMMV...."
3.0,"The side of the handles seem paint came off after a few gentle use.<br />It’s a pretty purse and I like it, but this is a little disappointing."
3.0,These fell a little cheap but I guess you get what you pay for. It’s nice that the sizing can be adjusted since my husband has fat feet.
3.0,"It is nice but didn't WOW me.  It is a solid piece, with a good clasp."
3.0,They aren't as plush as my other ones. A little lighter weight than I expected...
3.0,a bit tight. possibly need size chart
3.0,Very cute and fit well but had to return because I received a deflected scratched one .otherwise I would give 5 stars .
3.0,A little large but great top.
3.0,It comes very very small!
3.0,The fabric is “Jersey fabric shirt” ...
3.0,did not do what was printed
3.0,"Neckline plunges much too deep, takes away from the look of the dress.."
3.0,"The rubber that holds the frame becomes very loose and the glasses slip off all the time. Pretty chain, but if you need it to walk around with, I'd skip this one."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but my chest are too big. I can not use"
3.0,Didn't know it was see through.
3.0,This looks exactly like its picture. Very cute.
3.0,"It's cute looking, kind of make me feel/ look rocker-ish. Only complaint would be it's pretty difficult to put the backing wings in and the wings kind of curls up than straight down. I have to look into the mirror and flip my ear and shove it in. Takes some strength and time."
3.0,Not as much glitter as picture shows. Colors are much more clear and muted.
3.0,"I had ordered several of these sweaters in different colors.<br />I am a US size S in sweaters usually, and ordered M in all colors, based on the chart given and customer reviews advising that they were Asian-sized.<br />While the quality of the item is nice, I cannot stress enough how important it is for the seller to distinguish between Asian and regular sizing among different colors. Of the 10 I bought, 4 of them were too big.<br />As much as I'd love to buy most of the other colors, AND a few crew neck cardigans by the same company, I can't afford the gamble. I live in The Bahamas, and the cost to return is not worth it. I'd advise that the seller resolve this issue."
3.0,it does the job but it is really unattractive. I dont like wearing it
3.0,"The shirt took awhile to arrive, and the front graphic was as expected but the there was no text on the back at all. I would like to return it for one with text on both sides but i haven't heard back from the seller. Thanks."
3.0,"The title says 2-piece stockings yet it just turned out to be garter belt-like stockings. The description says no garter belt included, so bit of a mixed information. I thought the description wasn't updated. For 6 bucks, it's not worth it."
3.0,"The shirt itself is cute, although a little bigger than I thought it would be. But it’s soft and comfortable. My biggest complaint is the color. It is not bright red, as pictured. It’s more of a pinkish red. I’m still planning to wear it, but I wish the color was red like the picture."
3.0,"I gave it 3 stars because the suit is very cute but I don't know what they were thinking when they created the top. I am a C-cup and the top was like an A-cup. Also, the torso area was short, so you had to really pull the top up and and the tie strings on the top and back were not long enough. The other issue is that it is lined but not correctly. You had to keep adjusting it, to make sure it didn't show, as the bottom of the suit would roll up. Sending it back ..."
3.0,"My son loves his shoes, but within a month, they've already started disintegrating! The fabric has started separating from the rubber near the toe, and they look awful. Within two months of his birthday (for which these shoes were a present), they are already trashed enough that I won't let him wear them to school... they're rough and tumble outside shoes, now. I'm disappointed."
3.0,It is as advertised; cute enough.  But pretty underwhelming in person.
3.0,"Me quedo un poco adjuntada, si calidad es ta relacionada a su precio"
3.0,"Its cute. I am usually between a medium and a large and ordered an XL and its still snug. If I lost 15lbs of my 160, 5'7&#34; frame then it would be perfect in XL. Might still get away with wearing it only to the beach or places where everyone is self conscious too..."
3.0,"Cute, but see through"
3.0,"very very snug, the material feels nice, but it digs in the pits and is very snug on my limber arms. I am 6'2&#34; 180lbs. and this large is a little overly snug. if you have a are 6'-3&#34; and are thinking Large, unless you are super skinny, I would recommend USXL"
3.0,"Very thin, transparent fabric."
3.0,"First the positives: the animal print is so cute. They are soft, kinda silky feeling.<br /><br />Now the negatives: the waist is not high enough. I think these are ok just to wear around the house but I don’t think I can work out in them. They slide down when I’m walking around so I know if I run they aren’t going to stay up.<br /><br />If you are super thin they might work. I’m curvy, 5’8”, 165 lb and they just don’t work too well for me.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. Have a great day! 😁"
3.0,"I did make another similar purchase of which I was happier with because it was double lined these caps Are not double lined.  Also the satin side is on the outside as opposed to the inside against your hair which to me defeats the purpose. Also the satin side is on the outside as opposed to the inside against your hair which to me defeats the purpose. I Do you Use a devacurl son scarf to pineapple my hair And Use this Over it to sleep.  The band is thinner,  but still stays in place."
3.0,"I'm about 5'4"" so I'm very short, but I rolled them down and...it probably didn't really look nice on me because they went up to my rear end, which was a little awkward."
3.0,I have been looking for a sweater in this shape but the material is very very stretchy which I don't actually prefer. I am going to keep it but I wish it was a bit more structured.
3.0,"I like the design and the feel, seems good quality, however it's too big for the Surface 3 I bought it for."
3.0,"If you're paying $25 for this, it's not going to look like it does in the picture. Be prepared for that. Some sellers are selling the expensive ones and they come looking right, some are selling the cheep knock off ones. The cheep ones are good for a Halloween night of fun though. Just be prepared that if you're not paying a bundle the quality will be low. Also if you're buying a cheep one up the size to be safe."
3.0,Haven't used it
3.0,The size is of the chain smaller than I expected it to be.
3.0,Very pretty but it runs small. I usually wear an xl top but I wanted it to be roomy so I went up a size.  The xxl fits like a large so it's snug.
3.0,Wayyyy to big!  Decided to donate!
3.0,I am a big fan of WWE so I am so glad I found it through amazon
3.0,Not a terrible product just not my size. I normally need a 2x but they only at xl’s so I got an xl because i figured it’d only have to sit open anyway. It didn’t work so i returned it.
3.0,"Didn't realized this is literally like a corset. Way too restricting for me but if you want something super tight, get it."
3.0,the sizes run small and I got the largest size there was . It fit a tad bit small bit very comfortable.
3.0,They were big and you couldn't adjust it. It wasn't suppose to go past my knuckle and it fit like a regular ring.
3.0,The zipper scratched my hand more than twice. It doesn't open wide enough.
3.0,The band started to break after a couple months of wearing it.
3.0,I used to Amazon size chart expecting a L(12) but the dress was too small :( The dress seems to have good quality so that is a plus
3.0,Nice but could've just got some from a local store for cheaper.
3.0,"Great look, but run small."
3.0,Had to return and order size larger.  Runs short.  Son usually wears a large.  Had to order xl and is short on his 5’11 frame.
3.0,"Too small to fit a standard folder without having to bend/curve the corners over. Cute little backpack, just wish it could hold the school supplies we need to pack for preschool."
3.0,"I'm not sure of the UV cleaning, but the power cord is way to short. The cord keeps you from putting the device where you'd like to. I know I have to keep the plug and box right next to each other. They need to add a longer power cord."
3.0,Looked much better in the picture
3.0,they are way smaller than I thought they would be.
3.0,"They're a little heavy and the clip is too loose,they would be cute if they fit right"
3.0,"A little disappointed, the material is semi-shiny and cheap looking. Mine came with a stain on it, I had only noticed it after I had installed it. And just FYI, it is not on a solid white background.<br /><br />Now...do I want to take it off or just leave it..."
3.0,Quality shirt but a little shorter than advertised.
3.0,"F it in the front, very cute, but couldn't strap it with 2 extensions on the back. I'm an average girl, wear  medium shirts and this was still too small."
3.0,Did not recive the scarf pictured. It was the colors were all very bright not vintage as shown
3.0,I would love the coat but is way to big I fit 3 times in it so I gave it to my friend she ways  twice a much as I do plus was not to keen that it buttons for a male
3.0,"The white is definitely see through. Purchased because other reviews said it wasn’t, but it shows my tattoos through the fabric and the top part has an extra layer that covers boobs only, and you can then see where it stops under the dress. Very stretchy, I’m 26 weeks pregnant and 143 lbs (5’2”) and the small fit and was flattering, but I’ll have to return since it’s so sheer. Wish it came in more color options…"
3.0,irregular size
3.0,I ordered a large size which I new the x-large was way to big. These are cut way big. I’ll try a medium
3.0,"Haven't tried these skimmers yet, quality looked great, size was way out of whack! Ordered a 14 - usually wear a 12 or 14. These must have been a 24. They were so large I could have fit into one leg. Exchanged for a 12, we'll see....."
3.0,I'm busty so having room under my arm is important. This top was washed & hung dry & arms shrunk.
3.0,"These hats are a really good price but they do look cheap and kind of corny, like they were won from some sort of game booth. But for a laugh they were worth the $12 or so I spent on them"
3.0,It's really cute but it runs small. I also didn't really like the material. It stays pretty stiff like. Not something id want to wear outside when it's hot.
3.0,Super qri keep and very hard to get out.
3.0,I had trouble zipping wallet with all my cards in it!  Then zipper does not work.  Waste of money!!
3.0,"This dress is a beautiful little white eyelet summer dress. Unfortunately, it is completely see-through so we returned it. Not lined."
3.0,"Runs a little wide for little feet, i buy a size big so my kids can grow into them, but they slip out of these easy, no way to tighten the elastic laces. Still a decent shoe"
3.0,"Pretty dress, but too small through bust and shoulders"
3.0,"It's a very pretty ring, but way too big for my liking. Also a little too costume jewelry for me as well. Started to tarnish on the bottom side of my finger but did not turn my skin green."
3.0,Like top and fabric but the sizing is seriously off.  I bought up a size.. and the shirt fit tight. If you like loose I would suggest going up two sizes
3.0,"the clips are ok, but could have been stronger."
3.0,Runs big so get a size down
3.0,Bought it for my daughter's school birthday party and everyone loves it...most of the mask was designed for boys
3.0,Great dress bad zipper
3.0,Mask is not as breathable as advertised. Can’t tell the difference between the silk mask and the regular paper ones. Not recommended
3.0,"Was ok made.  Not bad, not good"
3.0,It runs quite small - my son wears 4T and I purchased in 5T...both top and bottom are too short. Also faded quite a bit after just one wash.
3.0,"They fall out easily and are very noticeable, not inconspicuous like I had hoped."
3.0,"The material of this shirt isn't smooth at all, it is itchy and heavy! Don't wear it in the summer!"
3.0,"Fits lower on the hip for some reason, breathable, comfy fabric"
3.0,Its a cool looking credit card holder - not that functional - Wouldn't recommend for daily use.
3.0,I bought these for my daughter. She wears a size 9.5. I had to turn these because they run real small. Other than the size they are really cute.
3.0,"The shirt wasn't the material as expected. It was like a bathing suit material. The straps are slightly awkward, and it was loose, but hugged the skin at the same time. I would recommend going a size up if you want it flowy like the picture."
3.0,"I'm not sure how to rate this dress. I love the fabric, but it's not well made. Lots of unfinished and fraying edges and those pom poms are ridiculous. Very tacky, don't know why they are there. But the biggest issue is the facing around the v-neck is not sewn down so it doesn't lay flat. Fortunately I can sew, so I fixed these problems. The pom poms are gone and facing sewn in place...now I like it!"
3.0,Very pretty but too tight for my average wrist.
3.0,I liked the necklace but did not realize the letter would be quite SO small.
3.0,The dress had an overwhelmingly bad smell of plastic. I could not wear it.
3.0,Was definitely not for  me
3.0,Although I like this ring very much it’s a very small it’s a lot smaller than what’s pictured if it was the size that it was pictured it would be perfect.
3.0,"I bought these for my cheer team to wear for BCA month in Oct. They were cute and adorable when they first arrived, but after just one time wearing they pink on the ribbon began wearing off. By they end of the month, keep in mind these where only worn one day out of the week) over half the pink sparkles had come one and the bows were limp and didn't stay up :("
3.0,It's an ok shirt....ordered the deep blue color and received a sky blue color. The cut seems off/crooked...like the grain of the fabric goes a weird direction. Sizing seems fairly accurate.
3.0,Fingertips are too long for a 3 year old.  Don't see how the gloves would fit in the wrists on a much older kid
3.0,Cute dress but made for tall and slender people.
3.0,Has to return.  Holy.  Shiny....... my son was not having it. Take the pictures and imagine them sparkly allll over.  I though they were cool but my  son.  Nope lol.
3.0,Clasp is not a good design
3.0,It looks great on my 3 year old she loves the head band although I wish it wear made better looks like it might fall apart if she messes with it to much. The pants fit her perfectly and so does the top. It took about a month to get here I almost forgot I ordered it.
3.0,"HARD to rate. There was nothing wrong with the ordered item as far as I know, but it did not meet my expectations, because I ordered the wrong Item. It would have been for some other Beretta, not the one I have.<br />I modified it so it does the job as I could not, in good faith, return it.<br /><br />Charles"
3.0,"I did not have high hopes, this product is indeed cheap but looks ok. You get what you pay for. 3 stars just for the price"
3.0,This necklace is as shown. My chain was knoted though. Now it has a kink in it. Nice owl though.
3.0,As a dress it would be fine but I wanted to wear it with leggings and it was to long for that in my personal opinion.
3.0,"Didn't realize this was polyester. But, super cute and good quality for the price."
3.0,They're nice but much smaller than I expected. I knew they were only 2&#34; in length but I did expect the diameter to be larger. Perspective pictures from the buyer with a model wearing them would be great!
3.0,Wayy too big I guess my son will have to wait.
3.0,"I'm a size Large. That is what I ordered. However, this shirt is way too tight and makes me feel so uncomfortable wearing it. I'm still deciding on whether or not I want to keep it (because I am losing weight) and see if it fits better, or just donate it to the Salvation Army or something. I'd say buy it, but get a size or two larger than what you are."
3.0,Such a cute hat BUT I got a bluish grey hat but the pompom is purple and black :(
3.0,"Order a L, fit like a S/M, could not pull dress down,"
3.0,These earrings were a little larger than I thought. I didn't pay great attention to the size. Check the size instead of just the price
3.0,Next time I'll probably order a large. I don't really like how the neckline is and the material is much thinner than I expected. But overall it's cute and simple.
3.0,Black dress shoes for a toddler. style is meh. Quality is meh. Price was reasonable. We needed them for a one time formal gathering and they worked out. I wouldn't buy them if they are intended to be used on a regular basis.
3.0,"I loved this skirt but it’s a weird fit. When I had the skirt on it fit perfectly, however has the day went on the skirt started to loosen up a bit becoming a little big around my waist. I would say order a size down because of that if you don’t have a big butt. If your like me and have a big butt it is a little short on the back, so that mixed with the waist loosening is just a bad combo"
3.0,They do a good job when I use the computer
3.0,"These are super comfy, however, when I bend over the top folds down and slides. Tummy control? No. Just comfy and great pockets. As long as you don't bend over."
3.0,Sticks to everything!
3.0,Don’t love it.  Material is a little weird and not as flowy as I had hoped.  I’m 5’7”ish and about 170 and it fits pretty tight.
3.0,Fit is ok but material is too thick and not soft.<br />Not for summer jeans
3.0,"Great shoe, jus fits small. Had to go up a size"
3.0,"It's made of a very thin, cheap material. It clings to the body and is not flattering. It is however, very lightweight and comfortable, but because of the way it looks on me, I won't wear it out anywhere."
3.0,"A bit snug in the shoulders and across the chest--and this is the size I always wear!  Washed it once and it did not shrink, so hopefully it will last and wear well. Usually good quality from this company, so I was surprised by this inconsistency."
3.0,I love the color and fit of this band.  I wear it a lot.  It has not held up to frequent changing of bands as other watch bands.  I would recommend this band if you don’t switch your bands much.
3.0,I am a large and this dress fits bigger than expected a medium would fit better
3.0,this seems to e a size larger.
3.0,They're okay some of them are scratched a little bit.
3.0,"It's ok. Not as vibrant red as the picture but it looks more or less the same. The back flops a bit where it opens but its decent. I have like 0 boobs basically and a tiny butt, this dress shows all your curves and flaws so.. either wear with a slip which might be hard given the open back.. or if you got it go get it girl!! (or guy ;)<br /><br />Not bad though, just wasn't expecting such a dull red so I won't be wearing."
3.0,Product is great but the logo is a lil off. If u have ocd this would drive you crazy but well worth it.
3.0,3X fit like an XL.
3.0,My son loves the umbrella....my only complaint is that they sent me a broken one. They fixed the break with wire. Didn't notice it till now. I'm irritated they sent me a broken umbrella if it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.
3.0,A little small but look really nice for work or a night out
3.0,My son loves it! He's really a medium but we ordered a size up because of the previous reviews. A medium would've fit (he's 9 and 63 lbs) but now he can grow into it.
3.0,Okay but nothing special
3.0,Fits small by 2 sizes. Nice quality.
3.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful but the only issue with it is that the sewing on the skirt part is backward and upside down. I'm also only 4'9 so the dress goes down to my calf instead of above the knee.
3.0,"They will stay in the same spot when you have finally gitten the strap where you are able to work it. The reason they lose 2 stars is that the metal clasp can rub into the side of your leg which is extremely unpleasant. I found that if you wrap some first aid tape you get at the dollar store around them it takes care of that problem. My other issue is that the loops at the bottom are twisted and not set so there is no way to get rid of the cork screw on it. I recommend strongly that you get this compnaies shirt stays, but make sure they are the ones with the plastic adjustment. I have gotten 2 seta of those before and never had any issues. I messes up this time and got these by accident. Won't make that mistake again. Guess these would be okay for someone who only has to use them a coyole of times a month, but not great for everyday use."
3.0,I would’ve gave it 5 stars but it is thin. I ordered it in white and it was Ivory.
3.0,"Cute, but too small up top.  Had to send it back"
3.0,"You buy wool socks for one reason, really: warmth. These socks are not 100% wool, but I didn't think the small percentage of polyester would make such a huge difference. I am comparing these to 100% wool socks which are usually about twice as thick as these thin socks are.<br /><br />However, these socks not being as thick can work to their advantage as does the color. In a situation where regular wool socks would not be appropriate (i.e. with dressier shoes) then these socks are a nice compromise between really warm wool socks and just plain cotton socks.<br /><br />If you want big warmth, I suggest other socks (that are gonna cost more). If just somewhat warmer than cotton is okay with you, these socks are cheap enough to give a try.<br /><br />Warmth: Two stars.<br />Versatility: One star.<br />Total rating by me: Three stars."
3.0,"I wear 7-3/8 (23"", 59.5cm), liked the hat, just too small, gave to my 9yr old grandson, he likes it, wears it all the time."
3.0,"Just received my Capezio Women's Camisole Tank (with adjustable straps) and as soon as I took it out of the package, I became concerned about the size and fit. Extra large was the biggest size offered, so I figured that would be enough, since I am a large on most t-shirts. Although the quality is superb and the camisole does (barely) fit, I would offer additional larger sizes such as 1X and 2X--with the range of colors--because not every girl will be slim with a minimal bustline. For the larger or bustier people reading this...find something else to cover up.<br /><br />It is a fantastic product, and I'm sure if it fit better I would have given it a higher rating. I will be keeping this cami, but it is NOT something I would ever wear by itself. It will only be concealing what needs to be concealed, including itself."
3.0,Runs very small. Otherwise looks like a nice skirt.<br />Couldn't even get it over my hips. Order up 2 sizes and you might be ok.
3.0,"It is a cute hat and I love the ponytail thing, only complaint is it's cheaply made. The fabric where the ponytail holder is ripped the first time I went to put it on."
3.0,Very big for a “small.”
3.0,"Necklace is really small, quality seems decent. The box is comes in is terribly made however and uses styrofoam to keep the necklace in it. Poor, poor quality. Ruined the gift giving."
3.0,I tried this on and it's a bit too tight in the hip area I should've taken a medium. However the fabric is very thick and soft
3.0,"These definitely run small, they were a bit see through. I ordered the neon green & they were yellow not green"
3.0,"It does list the size, but it was very small - smaller than I expected. Still, a lovely sentiment."
3.0,"It was a beautiful, well made dress I  looked forward to wearing BUT after ordering two different sizes both of which were larger sizes than I normally wear, I came to the conclusion that the dress is just WAY TOO SHORT. I'm 5'5 and if it is that short on me I can't imagine how short it is on someone taller than me... I was really disappointed. This dress would've been perfect had it been made just a tad bit longer."
3.0,Zipper fell apart after second wash.
3.0,"Not the best sewing done on product, seams are coming apart."
3.0,"These are cute but the picture is kind of deceiving , they are actually very small"
3.0,Sizing in short length was not quite right. Shorter than expected.
3.0,The back on the earrings are very loose and keep falling off.
3.0,The style is nice however the fabric doesn’t look as nice as I expected.
3.0,Looks a little different in person but it was cute
3.0,The suit did not fit well. Seems a little off I am tall and slim and it felt baggie and un-tailored. Style and quality were OK but I did not think it was worth getting tailored and returned it. Fit seemed accurate using size chart
3.0,"I was disappointed that the matching shoes shown in the pic were not included, as the description clearly states that the doll is not included, but does not state that the shoes are not included. The entire reason I chose the outfit was for the shoes in the pic....I will keep the outfit because the clothes are well made and cute, but will be hesitant about future purchases"
3.0,Pants were way too long and shirt was not long enough. Great material though. I returned mine bc I am petite.
3.0,"The watch looks very nice. The detached watch band with no instruction on how the links work - well, lets say that alone cost the review 2 stars.<br /><br />Im digitally challenged as such fixing the links together is not as easy as demonstrated in the watch ads second view.<br /><br />It would be nice if the instructions came with the watch as well."
3.0,"I like the style of the shirt, but I wear a medium and the mediums were close to being a large"
3.0,"The case &#34;upper&#34; is leather, but the base is some kind of plastic. Time will tell if it holds up..."
3.0,These run small and dont stretch much - very hard elastic
3.0,One of the straps broke the first time I used it. I still love the bag because I can still use it as a backpack.
3.0,"I love the look by all means but it slides off my head and that is the worst feeling ever!!! If you do not plan on getting super sweaty, then its a great band because it doesn't slip when my hair isn't wet."
3.0,Kind of cheap looking and feeling
3.0,Got this for my son actually. Colors were vibrant just as advertised. Very cute outfit does run a little big.
3.0,"better than most reviews... they’re pretty crooked, but they look fine and they do have the nose piece 😂"
3.0,A little sharped edged and impossible to engrave on the inside which was very unfortunate but still holds an elastic well.
3.0,Shrinkage after drying
3.0,I just didn't like the belt.I donated it along with some other stuff to a charity thrift store
3.0,Súper small for large side.
3.0,"These look great! The clasps clasp that has the pin to hold the other strap seems a bit loose.  The band came rigid as expected with leather but seems to have soften up a little. The fit is a bit short for me. I'm a big guy but I don't think my wrists are that big. I wear an XL glove depending on brand. I can only comfortably (very slightly loose) leave it on the 2nd or 3rd hole. And if I try to adjust by one notch, it will be too loose or too tight.<br /><br />I have never had any time of allergic reaction to anything (medicine, food, metal, etc) but I have began to get a rash on my wrist from wearing this. The only reason I'm not blaming the watch is because I've had my LG G watch for 2 months without any incidents of rash or outbreak. Could possibly be something they used on the strap or clasp.<br /><br />Besides that and the loose clasp, I like this watch band."
3.0,Very narrow and tight fitting shoe. Had to remove inside sole in order to be able to wear. Terrible foot support.
3.0,Mesh like martial son liked it
3.0,"A gift for my 9 year old daughter for her Hermione Halloween costume. She loves it. However, the necklace chain arrived broken at the connection to the pendant on one side. I temporarily fixed it with a pair of pliers, but I do t expect it to last much past Halloween."
3.0,Cute dress and i really wanted this to work. But the bottom material was super thick and stiff. Not at all flattering.
3.0,looks kind of cheap and don't like the way it was packaged but my grandmother loves stuff like this so will give it to her.
3.0,"Absolutely LOVED these glasses,  but they fell apart. I cannot return them because the return window closed yesterday. Super sad"
3.0,I wish that the ears stood straight up. Had to tailor to fit a kid. Meant for an adult.
3.0,"For us &#34;curvy&#34; girls, this cover-up is too tight in the hips.  Still functional, but not exactly what I was hoping for."
3.0,"I haven't used it yet, but I thought it would be much larger. I will have to use it for a carryon rather than a checked bag."
3.0,I'm 6ft tall.  Ladies with long legs this will not fit like the model. It's very roomy but it fits like a shirt..<br />There is a hole in it.. not sure if it came that way or I did it.<br />Fabric is ethnic and pretty but a little thin and flimsy
3.0,"Received my glasses on time, which was nice. They are super cute on but I cannot see out of them. Everything is 10x brighter, doesn't really shade anything. Just for looks."
3.0,"I like the belts, but adjustable pieces are sharp and stick you in the back. I bent sharp edge  down ,was afraid it would poke holes in my tops.  Design needs improvement."
3.0,The elastic was bad. Cheap and thick. Had to pay to have it altered. Kept riding up and rolling. Not sure if I got a badly made one. Pretty pink color. Cost me $20 to have it altered.....
3.0,The lace on the bottom at the seam area needed repair.  I can sew so no problem for me.
3.0,Fits good but not a flattering style at all.
3.0,Pretty good quality piece for the price point. The turquoise is reconstructed and fairly cheap but it’s decently attractive for the cost. If the stones stay intact it’ll be totally satisfactory.
3.0,Thought it would be more red.
3.0,"I like that it keeps your arm tight they don't shake, but I been using it for a while n I noticed a little different when I don't wear it"
3.0,"Very short, fabric not to my taste"
3.0,"Bought these for my wife as she wanted a platform heel boot.  These are ok, but there is an area near the ankle that they pinch my wifes ankle.  Its like the leather needs to be folded a different way."
3.0,This is a pretty bracelet.  I just don't happen to love rose gold.  It is pretty cool looking though.
3.0,Not very comfortable. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"these are really cute except that they're noticeably thinner on the shoe part and thicker on the ankle part where the shoe doesn't cover it up. They're more for the style than anything else, so you can’t hike or run or go to work in them which bothers me. Like why can't I find any Gudetama merch that isn't cheap?"
3.0,"I am updating my review. After setting the time and date, the bezel does not jiggle anymore and turns like it should. This is actually a very nice watch for the money that’s for sure.<br /><br />However it’s a little small for my liking."
3.0,"This is a pretty bra and it is everything I expected in the way the fabric looks/ feels, but it is too small. I bought my size, but I could prob go 2 sizes up for it to fit right."
3.0,Not suited for my needs. Great customer service.
3.0,"This skirt is exactly what I was expecting for the price. The material is very thin but not super see-through - I could wear any color undergarments but they would have to be seamless. The fit is okay, it is definitely not a tight skirt but it accentuates curves. The downside of the skirt is the very obvious zipper on the left side. It ruins the shape of the skirt because it doesn’t lay flat and the only way I can fix it is by rolling the top. Overall, I’m a server so I needed an easy skirt for work and this fits the bill, not great but not terrible either."
3.0,Good fit and quality hat for a low price. The writing and logo looks like a decal so I am a bit skeptical how it will hold up to laundry washings. I will let you know and possibly upgrade my review.
3.0,Liked style but the crotch was to low.
3.0,Beautiful shirt but I'm tall and slim and it's a bit short.  I'm 6'-3&#34; tall.
3.0,Came with no instructions on how to assemble. Had to return
3.0,There's a side tie on top of the dress that adjusts the dress. It's weird and awkward. I haven't really adjusted the dress yet with the tie. The dress seems fine once i can perfect the tie.
3.0,Honestly was expecting better quality and fit because I had a cheap pair of guess different than these that I loved. Still good shades with a nice case that work well. My heads also larger which could explain my fitting issue
3.0,I didn’t realize the arms are separate detached sleeves 😩
3.0,One bracelet broke right away 😔 but the other my son gave to his girlfriend and it hasn’t broke and she loves it.
3.0,"I like the Colorado scene, but I was looking for something to fit my Pandora bracelet. I had to make adjustments to make it fit."
3.0,"The material is not at all as described. The dress is very clingy and leaves nothing to the imagination. It can be worn out, if you're into exhibitionism. This is another summer dress that has been relegated to Long Pajama usage."
3.0,Love this  got lots of comments but once I washed it is started to slowly fall apart
3.0,The style is exactly what I wanted but the material is very poorest of quality.
3.0,5’10” / 150lbs / 36c / ordered a large<br /><br />Ordered this suit for myself and for a friend: it was awful on me and fit her great bit the cups are VERY far apart so she had to mess with it all night to avoid a nip slip. Not practical at all but the top was super cute on her.
3.0,Will fit up to size 6-7 but really not for plus size women.
3.0,Runs really small. I ordered one size larger than I usually wear and wish I had gone a size larger. Nice fabric. Looks as shown. Great price!
3.0,"I ordered a large, which I normally wear.  It's too small. An xlarge would even be too small for me I think. Definitely order a few sizes up.  I should have returned it. Other than that I love the style and color!"
3.0,"This was a cute sweater and very soft, but I was expecting it to be longer. I am short, 5’1, and it cannot be considered a tunic style. At best, just oversized.  I returned it."
3.0,"Love the color, love the style, love the look - BUT they were crazy too small! I fluctuate between sizes 25/26 and I bought the 25, wanting a more form fitting look. I figured if they are high-rise, they'll tuck me in a bit if needed. The waist hit a bit below my belly button (not as high-rise as I wanted) and gave Major muffin top and the thighs felt like they'd rip if I bent my knees Lol. I'm returning, BUT going to try a size 27 because I do really want them to fit and I need them in my life! They are darling and stylie, but run small... at least for me (5'3"", 118lbs)."
3.0,"Shipping was pretty quick, it arrived as pictured. As soon as I used it I knew that it has a major flaw. Maybe it was just the one that I got, but I noticed right away that the spring for the clip was somewhat weak. And of course when I use it for my tie it doesn't have nearly enough grip to keep itself horizontal. The clip kept sitting with a slant and every time I would fix it few moments later and it starts to slant again. I would recommend trying elsewhere for a tie clip. This one may be disappointing."
3.0,"Although, I have purchased other shorts by the same company for some reason there’s definitely ran small. Overall, the quality seems fine but the fit is off.  Also, these do not have pockets which I’m not sure was made abundantly clear."
3.0,"I gave only 3 stars because I like a larger earring and it was hard to tell from the picture. They are very pretty and delicate, so maybe I will find another top to go with them. Good price."
3.0,"The watch itself appears to be a very nice piece but there are some inconsistencies. The package had been opened and there was a corner of the tag torn off. Not even neatly cut, just torn. Also the warranty card that came with the watch indicates a one year warranty. If I go to Citizen's site they show a 5 year warranty on the watch. You can draw your own conclusions, I am just reporting the facts."
3.0,"It's okay, but cuter in the photos."
3.0,Remove pubes completely or you’ll have the Epilady treatment. Not what we were going for right before intimate time.
3.0,"Cannot use it, it runs small.."
3.0,I really like the material and how soft these pajamas are.  I have 2 pairs. The elastic waist band is a bit tight.  :-(  I wish there was just a draw string option
3.0,"Dress is cute and fits well, but the design doesn't pop as well as I had hoped. Alice in Wonderland elements are a bit obscure unless you closely study the dress."
3.0,Like except it's hard to release
3.0,Be careful! The pictures displayed for the blue and light grey are switched so I thought I ordered a light grey but wound up with a blue 😢
3.0,"If you have curves, these shorts will not work. I wear a large in these types of shorts and these were so tight. The material seemed as if they would be comfortable if they did fit."
3.0,Basic slides that would not be good for any distance walking.
3.0,These shorts are completely see through.  make sure your son has a long top on!
3.0,"Although the product says plus, it is not for heavy breasted women, unless you are using it for coverage with your bra."
3.0,"They are super comfy but to tight for my liking but, does work better as a undershirt in my oppinion."
3.0,"This is very nice - but not as a pendant.  More like for a keychain, which is what I will use it for.  Little too large and bulky for a pendant."
3.0,its nice but runs tight i even got a size bigger than i wear it doesn't come up as high as it shows in the picture it is crotch-less and the way it opens in the back down there is weird its like one side is tighter and the other loose it has hooks like a bra hook all down the front with 2 settings and then a zipper and another hook the straps come off but wouldn't recommend it because it wont stay up also sitting down can be painful like youre losing your breath just fair warning it also shows like it has butt enhancement but it does not
3.0,I take great care of all my handbags and loved this one. The bag is in immaculate condition however the handles have disintegrated. I have a number of Scarleton bags and they are still perfect.
3.0,The pockets on the hip are not flattering
3.0,"I Purchased 2 of these watchbands, one  brown, and one grey. The quality is acceptable for the price. The clasp feels sturdy and the band feels solid. Compared to the original band though, these are much worse in quality. They are much stiffer, not as soft, and i highly doubt they are made of genuine leather. The smell is something i would describe as &#34;plastic & paint&#34; unlike the original band which smelled of quality leather. Thankfully, the smell dissipates after a few days and the band softens up. The reason(s) i took off stars are due to the smell and initial stiffness of the band, and due to the pins not being as secure(when changing the strap, it is possible to push the pin out of the strap with little resistance) as the factory included strap. I have also noticed that the color seems to be rubbing off the inside of the band after wearing it daily for about a week."
3.0,"I like the coat because it has zippers for the wings making it easier to wear together. The rest of the outfit was all over the place size wise. Gloves too small, pants way too large. Shirt kinda baggy... It was lacking, plus I had ordered a L and received XL so that didn't help! A good cosplay, but maybe shop around a bit before committing..."
3.0,Comfy but the neckline is a bit to snug for my tastes. Pockets are really just for decoration. Love the blue color. A little worried about the hem since its not finished. I'm hoping it won't fray.
3.0,"Ok quality  I ordered h, l, c and got h, l, a"
3.0,Runs small need to return .
3.0,These are very pretty. I haven't had them ling so I don't no how long they will hold up but there very pretty. Lil smaller than what I had expected. But still great for the price
3.0,Fades very quickly
3.0,Not as long as advertised
3.0,Gave to a friend and lasted for a couple of weeks. Not the best but does an okay job. If you use these for dancer heels be prepared to buy more.
3.0,"The boots were very nice but I was very let down when I realized that they didn’t make a shoe wide enough to fit me. I wear a New Balance D well and though the M Olukai boot said it would fit similarly, the two different pairs that I order, tried, and returned were like wearing ice skates. My foot hung over the edge on sides of my foot I wasn’t aware even existed. Means I can’t even wear one of the few brands that makes a casual boot worth wearing. TL:DR I loved the look in the pics and the materials and craftsmanship were top notch but the fit was horrible on a moderately wider foot and they don’t even make one wide enough and that just sucks."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:f152ba3c22111e2442ac77bdc5709c25]] One pocket is upside down!!!!!!!!!
3.0,"I really like these dresses, I have 2, but the pictures are nothing like the color you get. The dark red is more of a dusty rose color and the gray with palm leaves is light blue. The style is great for pear shapes, however. I'm 5'9"" & 160lbs and the large is great."
3.0,"The backpack is cute but it is NOt the dimensions it says there: ""Approximate dimensions: H:16 x W:12 x D:6in"". I will be returning it since it does not fit the things I need."
3.0,Too small for a man or women  OK for a child
3.0,I am 5 feet 2 inches tall and i wear a size 12 dress. This dress fits fine. The problem is it has blackish stains on the liner underneath and the bottom is NOT scalloped as the picture shows. Not the best quality but it only cost $33 what was I to expect. I don't have time to send it back and get another before the event I am wearing it to so I  will wear it anyways the sequins somewhat hide the stains and as a night event I think I can get away with it. Overall it is a very pretty dress. Sequins are a bit itchy on sleeves.
3.0,Was smaller than indicated
3.0,Nice and soft but loosing its shape already
3.0,Is such a cute dress but had to return. The straps were not adjustable and were only about 4 inches. I wish it would have fit :(
3.0,Very pricey for socks
3.0,"I'm 5'5 and weigh about 155lbs.  I bought a large and the three I bought fit fine but all are way too long. In the photo it looks as though it hits right below your bottom but these came halfway down my leg and I could have worn them for a dress so I'm returning. Also, one of them was sewn incorrectly on the arm and extra material was showing at the seam."
3.0,"I liked it, a little short but cute!"
3.0,"I was looking for cardigans for a wedding, and loved this sweater!  I got it very quickly, and the material was great.  I had to return if because I ordered a medium and XL, and the XL that came was a different brand and color.  Sad I had to return this one."
3.0,I choose the wrong color but decided to keep it. Very comfortable.
3.0,Didn’t look at size before I ordered
3.0,I have a rather large tummy and this dress made me look pregnant because of the waistband.  Am returning.
3.0,"If you are petite with small breasts and narrow shoulders, this may not fit well."
3.0,Within days it turned my neck green. 😒
3.0,"Looks great but looks are deceiving. Bag doesn't hold items,  it collapses.  Cooler pours melted ice water out of all four corners,  leakes all over your feet while walking.  Material mark's easily,  it would need to be washed every use.<br />I never leave bad reviews but quality just was not there at all. I am still a loyal Amazon customer,  bound to get a bad egg every now and again."
3.0,It is a nice bag. Looks like it is made well. The one thing that was disappointing to me was the fact that it does actually zip closed. It has a nice pocket inside that zips and a magnet closer at the top. I was really looking for a bag that zipped/completely closed.
3.0,"Es de origen chino. Es imposible encontrar la dirección electrónica del fabricante, que se anuncia en el empaque. Es un pulso bueno, pero demasiado caro."
3.0,"it is okay, but still not that easy"
3.0,decent but I'm not so sure about one-size-fits-all if it's a little tight on my head
3.0,Easy install and good protection for the watch but it scratches easily. I guess I'lll just have to buy several and plan to change them when necessary.
3.0,Honestly a get what you pay for situation kinda tough to adjust  and leaves a black ring on your finger where the actual ring was
3.0,I washed these a couple times before the ankle cuffs started sagging and the waist band is starting to fray.
3.0,"The blouse is nice however, the Wine Red color is really a bright Red color.  It lacks the darker tones you see in the picture."
3.0,"Cute dress, size runs small, had to give it to my daughter"
3.0,These grey Nike pants size S runs large.
3.0,One size and they didn't always fit me
3.0,"The material is comfortable and has a nice stretch. BUT the sleeves are much shorter, than they appeared on the model. So that part is disappointing. Overall a good product though. Just wish the sleeves were closer to the elbow."
3.0,"The length is fine, but the width is a bit narrow.  My little toes are on the trim piece and not inside, making them less than an ideal fit.  None  the less, as slippers go, these do have more overall padding in the foot bed, so they still feel good to my feet.  There is no true arch support."
3.0,I love how they look. Very tiny. I have a double piercing so I needed a very small stud for next to a hoop. It definitely marks that box. They keep falling out though. I’m already on my 3rd one and it’s only been a few weeks lol but they do come with a bunch for a very reasonable price so when one falls out I just pop a new one in.
3.0,"It looks like the picture, the cuff needs to be a little tight or it slides down, a bit longer than I expected but that’s okay"
3.0,As of 6/9/17...Still stinks. I worry that people around me think it's me and not my purse.
3.0,Description is accurate. Light weight.
3.0,I really like this cold but the measurements are really off. I bought a large as I have thick wrist. This is no way a large by their size chart.
3.0,"I had to give this product a 3. While I love the color the product is not the quality I expected. It looks as if someone took a piece of jersey material and sewed it together to give it the infinite look. The other sides aren't even sewn, which makes it look somewhat tacky. When you put it on you can't really tell because the edges kind of curl up, but it could stand to look a little better considering the reputation of the company. I really hope it doesn't unravel.<br /><br />I bought the mint green and the grey. I have worn both a couple of times at this point and wanted to purchase other colors, but I think I should first see how the ones I have hold up. Truth be told, I could actually make this scarf myself!"
3.0,no connectors were enclosed to connect it to the badge
3.0,THe earrings are pretty but backs aren't long enough to grab with fingernails
3.0,Nicely styled. Size smaller than expected.
3.0,"These are so cute but they do run small and are slightly tight on my average-sized wrist.  Also, some of the enamel is missing on a couple pieces.  They look like I didn't spend a lot on them if you look at them closely.  But they are fun."
3.0,Dress felt comfy but the top was a little see through
3.0,It doesn’t have the ear hooks the package said it came with but it did come with small scuff mark on a lens .  A corner of foam is pressed in and nothing I can do about it. Overall I’d return it if I didn’t need them immediately. I might of gotten a fluke pair who knows. It will still work just not happy about the condition of item.
3.0,"It’s okay, ordered black in small, fits a little bigger than expected."
3.0,The frame is rather heavy.I bought this frame and had the lens fixed. My spectacles drop down my nose bridge and I have to push them up repeatedly. I suggest you buy your frames locally from a physical store where to can try them for comfort. A lesson well learnt.
3.0,"This piece was cute, but the 5 came off before I opened the package"
3.0,My son walks on the side of the rubber and they don't stay on his feet well.
3.0,Nice bikini. I ordered a small but it was still very large on me. Be careful when ordering.
3.0,"Ordered medium. I like the color and fit, mostly, but dress was shorter than I was hoping. It barely covers my knees in the front and comes above on the sides. I'm 5'6"", 140 lbs."
3.0,Looks great but you can not tumble dry .  Must hang to dry .
3.0,"After reading other reviews I went a size up from what I normally buy. Even that was way too small for me. The large could not even cover my chest (38 C); my boobs were hanging out of the bottom of the bra. The material is actually very nice and the bra has a nice look to it, but the sizing is extremely off. I can't imagine how small an actual small is."
3.0,"very short, hits mid calf and i am returning it.  material was very nice. returning was very simple!"
3.0,Definitely needed to go up in band size. I usually wear 38 in sports bras and the 40 fit well.  The wires in the middle come up very high on the chest and I didn't find that the bra separated enough to keep the wires from just sticking up and out from my chest.  I had to return this even though it looks really cool in the pink color.
3.0,It's  a little cheesy but it works.
3.0,Looks good but the heart is larger than we expected and it turned my wife's ankle green.
3.0,I got a bigger size and it's just too loose and makes my chest look strange.
3.0,Just too small. I would order one size up at least
3.0,"I have purchased other socks from Bamboo sports in the past, and I have loved them (low cut ankle socks in white).  However these Bamboo Sport Crew Work Socks were too tight in the middle of the sock.  I returned them right away.  I did like the crew top, as it was very soft and easy to wear, but unfortunately the middle of the sock squeezed my foot too much when just trying it on.  I like that these are made from Bamboo, and will reduce germs and odor, but I will have to look for another more suitable style."
3.0,The fabric quality wasn't the best but it sure is a cute dress
3.0,"DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER. Follow washing directions - delicate or hand wash, line dry. Good news is, they dry fast."
3.0,It's dificult to order without trying but the reviews were. Very helpful
3.0,They are just a half a handkerchief and half paper that will definitely not wipe anything for you. A bit disappointing but still will do the trick for if you just want looks.
3.0,Bought for my 6yo she is tall but the swimsuit is not long enough. Ends up going up her booty pretty bad. She is 4 feet tall
3.0,This shirt is smaller than expected and somewhat oddly shaped but it is also very cheap so I guess I got what I paid for
3.0,Nice statement choker but it did not come with the advertised matching bracelet.
3.0,"clips break easily,"
3.0,Quality of material not as good as I expected. Shrinks a lot once dried in dryer.
3.0,"The white button down shirt was too tight around the neck, we had to go buy another shirt but the rest of the suit was great for the money"
3.0,"Cute, but too small. I had to return them. Fergalicious brand seems to run small; these were the second boots I had to return. Recommend sizing up. Return process with Amazon was easy and customer service was great."
3.0,"I tried another brand and returned them.  These are somewhat better; they turn white lights yellow; not much change of red tail lights.  The yellow color helps some with extremely bright lights head on, like when turning left at a signal. They really do not increase clarity like all of the ads portray."
3.0,Pretty but handle is too short and it is meant for a very young woman
3.0,"I normally wear large sunglasses. With a large head and face size, still the sides of the frame Is loose. Otherwise the quality is good, considering the price."
3.0,"size too large,"
3.0,"The holographic bag is pretty good quality for what it is but is much smaller than what I expected. There's a lot of wrinkling that doesn't phase me too much and dings that look that it's been punctured on the actually bag. Also, the inner lining smells strongly like fish and I can't seem to make it go away."
3.0,"I am 5'6, 150 pounds and I normally get size small sweatshirts so I was assuming a small would be appropriate. However, the small fit more like a medium so I'm just going to try to shrink it, although I'm not sure how well that will work out since its 50-50 poly cotton."
3.0,"I am short so this was quite long on me.  The elastic in the waist is quite tight, and by the end of the day I was ready to change out of it.  Material is nice - on the thicker side.  However, the back of the material is white, and when stretched over the bust (even with a dark bra) it looked like my bra was white.  I wore a jacket over it so ot was fine.  I have several other dresses by the same company that fit fine.  This one is snug on the top."
3.0,"Runs a little small, not for the very curvy among us"
3.0,Kind of bigger than expected as I wear a 38DD
3.0,Very cute style.  The sleeves are almost like a see thru cheetah print.  They are ADORABLE!  I ordered an XL from previous reviews (since I normally wear a L) and it is too baggy on me.  I do not like the way that it fits.  I would order this true to size.
3.0,The knots come undone after wearing it for a couple of days.
3.0,Nice product but really big and i thought i liked big earrings. Not for me. Had to return.
3.0,My 5 1/2 year old granddaughter has had these for less then a month and they're already bent out of shape and loose.  She's only worn them in the car 4 or 5 times and takes them off before going inside so it's not like she plays with them all the time.  A little disappointed.
3.0,"The sweater is nice and of good quality.  HOWEVER, I had read all the comments and purchased a sweater 2 sizes UP from my normal size and when I put it on it is  VERY SMALL!  Sad really.  These companies need to keep sizing the same."
3.0,Love the concept but hate getting cards out of the wallet. It’s exactly what I’m looking for as far as size is concerned but definitely needs a money strap instead of a money clip.
3.0,Hard for me to see out of - a bit cloudy but not too bad in the light
3.0,"I wear a size 9 in men's and these did not fit,they were more Like a size 7 in Mens<br />I order a Large,I still gave it 3 stars,because my Wife likes them"
3.0,Not too bad. Better than other online jewelry for cheap price. Doable and you can dress the dress up to look more expensive.
3.0,This item did not fit .  It was two small and did not fit a plus size W22!!!
3.0,"a little wide and her foot is a little too small all around other than length, but the shoes themselves are just adorable!!!! i think with some thick socks next time she will be good to go:)"
3.0,"Width was as expected but these are REALLY long. I am short but my figure looks better with longer shirts. This was way too long for me (they stop at the widest part of my hips). Also, the loop in the back cut into my shoulder throughout the day. Overall, I had to return them."
3.0,These are way bigger than I thought they would be
3.0,"It is small .The nose bridge part is very painful no matter how small your nose isIf like me you already cut the chin strap thinking it will fit less painful but it did not or just don't have the time to wait for another mask ,don't worry you have not completely wasted money. If it does not fit you can cut and alter it or if nothing is working it and you it can be made in to the dc comic version of cat woman especially if you all ready have glasses."
3.0,Love the buckle its heavy duty nylone is decent the only reason i couldnt give it 5 stars is that it doesnt have valcro to keep extra nylon strapped down but i soed my own on making it better
3.0,"This is NOT a maroon dress. It's completely red. Other than that, it's great."
3.0,It fits because it stretch but it shows all the flabs
3.0,"Definitely thin and low quality but adequate for wearing a few times a year.  Too short for 6' hubby to wear but fit boys ages 5, 8 &12 though had to double Windsor tie for 5 year old."
3.0,"Aprons for grandsons.  Material catches everything .  Have not washed them yet, but hoping that changes the texture a little."
3.0,"The fabric is super soft and the fit is just as expected. It can shrink if you throw it in the dryer, as did mine but it still fit since the fabric is light and stretchy."
3.0,The arms and legs were not long enough.
3.0,"Cute but the dye from the outfit got on skin, towels, roller seat, ect. Won't purchase again."
3.0,Nice graphic
3.0,Ear pieces kept coming off. Had to glue them.  Easily Scratched
3.0,If you are a true medium and sway to the small side order your true size. I am 5'7 150lbs. and based off of the reviews I ordered a LG because everyone commented to go up a size. I am usually in between a small/medium so the Lg was too big! The waistline is not tapered as shown in the picture. It's like a barrel. It's hard to tell but I would probably re ordered a med. on a positive note I do like the fact that you can roll this up and tuck it into the bag provided. This is a plus if you are looking for a easy travel jacket.
3.0,Set is cute and decently comfortable but is see through on bottom. Runs slightly small as well.
3.0,"Nice dress, nice fabric. I am typically a size extra small. I ordered their smallest size and it was still too big. In guess it's just not for me."
3.0,Wasn't the color I needed. They are bright fluorescent orange :(
3.0,This is so narrow in the toe box they physically hurt to wear. Luckily I own a shoe stretcher and that made them bearable. They still require some breaking in which is understandable but I really should have just returned them. I’m worried that the stretching may result in compromised longevity. I was really expecting more here.
3.0,It's just OK.  I'm only 5'2 and short-waisted but the torso part is still somehow too short and it drags my boobs down a little.  I get compliments on it but it doesn't fit well and I'm not comfortable in it.
3.0,"Longer than in the pictures, thin material, threading in the design were snagged and pulled out in three different areas"
3.0,"Nice style, great color. It is a little snug and I probably would have sent it back but the free return expired the day before it was delivered to me. That timing seems a bit off to me. It happened on two orders."
3.0,"These boots are good for the price, but they have no arch support.  They do not have solid soles and you can bruise your feet on hard objects.  I find them comfortable because i prefer to walk barefoot and these boots are like walking barefoot."
3.0,Batman hush?! What does that even mean?! Not as pictured.
3.0,So nice .well
3.0,"Sizing was a little off and the fabric was very very sheer. Cute dress and great style, but didn’t fit me well. I ended up returning it."
3.0,The Outdoor Research masks work better for my larger-than-average face/head.
3.0,it wasn't long enough to go around my neck. if ur bbw this will not fit! seems to have been made for a little girl
3.0,"Nice belt but not 2 inches wide, only 1 1/2 inches wide. Had to return and reorder."
3.0,Way to big for my 6 month old
3.0,Nice dress. Good quality material. Color purple not as pictured; looks much lighter. Not flattering on me because of the pockets sticking out and making my hip area look wider. Returned.
3.0,Shorts are too high waisted. Soft and true to size just made xx high rise
3.0,Did not look quite as flowing as photo and runs a little small. My sister still loved it.
3.0,Product ran smaller then expected.
3.0,"I've tried several body shapers and usually go down a size because I work out and have found that's what I need to get the body shaping results I desire. This shaper was no exception. I weigh 160 lbs. and wear an 8/10 and ordered a S.<br /><br />It was fairly easy to get on without help.<br /><br />What I found interesting about this body shaper is that it had a tendency to bunch at the waist--even after pulling it both up and down. I've never had a problem with this in any of the several body shapers I've purchased before. For reference: I am tall: 5'10"", and have a longer body than most women, so there should be no reason for the bunching. It may be that I have a very small waist. This shaper emphasized my small waist to make it look extremely small--even with the bunching fabric.<br /><br />It does a wonderful job of lifting the bottom, but it did nothing to slim my thighs--which I find annoying. Who wants bulging thighs? (If you do, this body shaper is for you! ;-) Although, I must say: It definitely gave an hour-glass shape."
3.0,"This is a lovely blouse. It fits me down to the waist, below the waist it's way too small. Don't want to return it because it's so pretty. I think I have a friend it may fit or I may use it as a scarf or make slits at the sides. It should be worn with a came since the material is thin."
3.0,I returned my large for a medium and I like it better and it is still plenty big.  I usually wear either a med or a large.  It would like more finished if it had trim down the front.
3.0,"I wear a size 7 all day long, so I ordered a 7. I was surprised that they were somewhat tight. After wearing for a while, they have slightly stretched out, but had I known then what I know now, I would have ordered a size larger. Also, this &#34;Michelle&#34; style is a little more tapered than the regular Ugg style, so it looks not quite so clunky."
3.0,"I like the fact that these mask are well made and cute when I wear them I get a lot of compliments,  but what I don't like about them is they are hot and they fog up and condensation accumulates in the clear part and wet your face up."
3.0,The material is very soft and great quality but I have a long torso & the cut of this is definitely for a shorter torso
3.0,Was a little snug for my taste. Gave me incentive to go back to the gym ;)
3.0,Feels cheap and hard to put on
3.0,The material is not sweatshirt material it's more silky. Not what I want in a sweatshirt.
3.0,"It is nice, but very small."
3.0,"It would some times turn upside down, so make sure you have it zipped up at all times that you're not getting it putting some thing in it-otherwise Thomas will fall out. But still it's so cute and looked good wearing it.  I'd recommended it."
3.0,"Very cute, haven’t used them yet but I was so sad to find out that they were not magnetic!!!!"
3.0,Shape is ugly and it’s a very stretchy material so it just kind of hangs there very heavily. Not impressed
3.0,"I bought the medium because the sizing looked small. It fits like a glove, but the description says the jacket is 70% cotton and 30% spandex. NOT true!  It is 97% polyester and 3% spandex. I never buy anything with more than 35% polyester because polyester does not breathe. The only reason I'm keeping it is because I MUST have a suit jacket for a trip I'm taking and have no time to shop further. Disappointed in the fabric, especially since it fits so nicely."
3.0,"Runs way big. Size down if you can. Especially if you like a slimmer fit. I got Small and I normally wear a 30x30 and they were far too big. Wish there was a smaller size available, because I really like the material and style."
3.0,"Received on time like said it would. Have used it for month now. So far ok holding up very well. Reason for three stars, is that’s credit card pockets are really tight and my iPhone7 doesn’t fit in it."
3.0,"The drawstring waist is functional, but it is made very poorly and it does not line up with the seams properly.  I use them as workout shorts and they are fine for a cheap short option, but not well made."
3.0,"These earrings are cute, but are not made well.  Maybe three out of the nine pairs did not have defects."
3.0,"I like the bag only thing is it’s not very big at all. I use it for swimming, I don’t think it would be the best beach bag IF you are packing for 2 maybe for 1 depending on what you bring. Two towels would fit but that’s it."
3.0,its small then expected
3.0,"I followed the measurements before ordering, but the large size is too narrow around my palm. Yet, the finger length is a tad too long. Seems these are made for women. They are hard to get on, and super uncomfortable to wear. My wife will adopt these as I look for a more comfortable brand."
3.0,"I look like Humpty Dumpty in it, but may that's a personal problem. (?) I just think this style will only be flattering to very thin people. I was expecting a t-shirt material for summer, but what I got was more of a &#34;jersey&#34; material.  It does seem well made, though.  I am normally a size 6-8 (leaning on 8 currently) and I bought a small, which I shouldn't have.  I really don't think this could look good on me even if I had sized it appropriately.  I may be too old for this style - it's so cute in the pictures!"
3.0,This piece is beautiful but it is soooo hard to read!
3.0,It's a cute bag not so durable stitching. Plan on going at it with a thread and needle . I'm a pack it all in type so it may last someone one who doesn't pack it all to go. Good pockets and side bottle holder seems to be holding.2 weeks of use .
3.0,"This dress took a long time to get to me, and when it did it was way too large. It's a very good quality dress, and I'm sad it didn't work out. It's also hard to do returns so if you buy please know your size so you don't have to deal with the return process."
3.0,I returned this shirt because it felt cheap and really even the logo looked like it was a lower quality.
3.0,It generally fits but the band width ( rib cage area) is very tight. Not an under wire bra but it feels like one. May return it for this reason alone.
3.0,"Great value and really cute. I ordered larger than I needed so that it would fit (based on prior reviews). Unfortunately,  there is a flaw in the material that shows on my shoulder blade so I can't wear it (unless a blue marker covers it).... I need to return it."
3.0,"item ok, looks better on website"
3.0,It fits your body good so make sure you are in good shape but it is comfortable
3.0,Not too happy<br />Not work for me this great<br />Ty MP🙃
3.0,I like the skirt but preferred the patterned skirts as compared to the solid.  It was alittle sheer
3.0,"The bra was super soft and I kept debating, but in the end it was just not supportive enough for me. The thin steaps seemed to just dig in a bit no matter how I adjusted it. But I really wanted to love it because it was so soft!"
3.0,Cheap material and not quite like the pic. But nice enough for casual resort wear.
3.0,"I ordered the Xtra large which is usually sufficient, but this is a bit tight in my upper arms. I was surprised because it was supposed to be generously​ sized. It's also a bit tight across the shoulders. The garment seems to adjust itself to my body as I wear it. With all the negatives, it surprisingly​ drapes nicely over my bust ( F cup). It's cute and I'll wear it, just not regularly."
3.0,Sizing is inconsistent buying multiple of the same dress. I wear a 1X to a 2X. Purchased the first two dresses in the XXL and they fit great were loose and roomy then I bought several others and they were all way too tight across the middle. The problem is some of these dresses have different fabrics but they look the same. The solid colors have like a shiny sheen fabric that shows all your lumps and bumps and it’s super thin and tight and some of them have a thicker material that you can’t see through and it’s more loose and flowing. These need to be consistent please. The one I bought that was loose and flowing is the one that is orange and black and turquoise and looks Hawaiian. all the others went back
3.0,"The tote bag seems sturdy, but it’s a tight fit for a standard quad set of LDS scriptures.  I bought it for an 8-yr old and it’s not easy for him to manage."
3.0,"Got these as a gift and was really excited about them. The color was a little more red then I expected, but the fit great. I had them for about 6 months and they were my go to sunglasses until 1 day I left them on the back of a boat and my daughter stepped on them climbing over the seat. These things shattered like no glasses I'd ever seen before. There was no chance of fixing them, there were pieces everywhere. She's pretty small and didn't even put all of her weight on them, but these things had no durability when it came to having some pressure put on them. Not sure I'd buy these again. I definitely want Wood sunglasses, but not sure these are the one's to go for."
3.0,Seems to be a little stiff.  Better with wear I suppose.
3.0,I was expecting a better tummy control against the breast cups that got tight.
3.0,They were nice but I have a big face so they were too small for my face. I've given them away.
3.0,"I have a 30 inch waist and 45 inch hips. So I ordered an XL and it’s too big on my waist. I also made the mistake of trying to step INTO my dress instead of putting it on over my head and it popped the stitching at the neck trim- so beware. If you have bigger hips put it on over the head.<br />I also ordered the dark green, and it’s actually a very bright green.<br />Overall a very pretty dress but not quite what a ordered."
3.0,They run small and material is quite thin.  I ordered a size up from my usual & kept what was delivered.
3.0,It is still a cute necklace but definitely  does not match the picture.
3.0,"I ordered one in white and one in gray, both smalls. The white one has significantly shorter sleeves than the gray one which fits perfectly. Inconsistent sizing."
3.0,"Nice color, and the material felt smooth, but it was thin and it didn't seem like it would hold up very well in the washing machine. I would not recommend this product unless u wanted thinner material."
3.0,Ordered 8 got 7 way too small
3.0,It's pretty small.
3.0,Very high waisted and large not tapered.. very ugly fit
3.0,"I’m 200lbs, 5’5 and prego. It ran pretty big on me. I bought a large. Usually a large fits perfect on me"
3.0,The tunnels do not work very well.
3.0,Kinda cheaply made .
3.0,"Very cute but even if you don't put much in, it's too much. Inside started to fray within weeks.<br />I don't like shopping for myself. My last purse lasted years. Just wanted something different for once."
3.0,"The shoe was somewhat small for a 9. So, if you want it to fit comfortably you should get a size above."
3.0,This particular one is a favorite of my daughters ballet program so I was forced to buy this brand. However my purpose was to get the next size up and that was not accomplished. I would suggest sizing up one more than you think you should.
3.0,I bought these for my 5 year old niece & they were way too big. They were so big they actually fit her mom perfectly.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:7f31e9d7445287da160a73f69f4e2912]] Most of the bangles were out of shape - oval in shape not perfect circle difficult to wear.<br />To be replaced
3.0,"The doughnuts fall off too easy, other than that they are greaf!"
3.0,I just didn’t like the fit of this product so I returned it.
3.0,These cargo pants wrinkle very easily. They’re long and skinny not suitable for average size boys.  We’re not happy with them but for a slender kiddo they might look just fine.
3.0,The lenses are fantastic.  The frames are large though.  I have a slim face and they are on the big side.  They are also too loose.  I have to tighten them up too frequently.
3.0,Good for look but can not use for a Covid19 face cover which is what I purchased them for. Very thin and can see through fabric when stretched.  Otherwise cute.
3.0,"I like the soft material and colors are great. This babydoll cut is very loose. If your not rail thin can make you look huge. It is cute and pretty pullover V-Neck babydoll top. But very unflattering for me and my body type, my chest is too big for this. Lightweight, would be a good summer top. Cotton, Polyester, Spandex."
3.0,"3 stars for the product fitting well, looking good, and shipping quickly. Minus two stars because the fit and length aren't as advertised and the color isn't what I ordered. The pictures show the striped portion hitting at the waist and the hem of the dress at or above the knee. But this is almost an empire waist, hitting 2-3 inches above my natural waist. And the skirt hangs a couple of inches past my knees. Also, I ordered green but what I received is clearly teal. I will still keep the dress because it fits well and looks good and I don't mind teal, but I already have several blue dresses and was looking forward to the green. I also am able to hem the dress, otherwise I probably would return it given the awkward length."
3.0,Ordered a 2X since i knew it was going to run small. I usually wear a Large or XL.. but this fit like a medium.
3.0,"This sweater is not too heavy and not too thin. Great for autumn, not for winter. The white is slightly sheer- I can see my nude colored bra through it. Love the functioning buttons. Great length on waist and sleeves. The only reason it isn’t a 5 star is because of being able to see my bra."
3.0,It Fit as expected.....Having said that after I read most of the reviews stating it ran small. I order an XL instead of my normal L. So it fit as expected knowing you need to order one size larger then needed.
3.0,I love this jacket. But the zipper broke only after wearing it a few times
3.0,"Somewhat small in the upper area - I am a little disappointed, and have returned a few dresses because of this issue. It's perfect other than I feel that if I stretched my arms too much to the front the dress will rip. I don't get it. I see other woman on here who are much bigger than me saying how wonderful the X-Large dress is, but here I am with a XX-Large dress that is still tight in the lace section. confusing... Might be returning!"
3.0,bought them for my nephew...seemed good quality but I don't know if he liked them yet since I had to ship them to him.
3.0,"Did not fit like adult glasses.  End up giving them to my daughter, who loves them."
3.0,"Very long.  My mother needed a short bib for when she sleeps.  She takes medication that causes her to drool, so she doesn't need a long bib.  These are for dinner time.  They cover someone's entire torso and lap.  Had to return them.  Not good for us"
3.0,"Lets start off with first impressions these boots look very decent and I am not a fan of synthetic leather footwear. They seem to be well stitched and I found no signs of oozing adhesives. The lacing hardware seem to be well constructed and the way to many zippers seem robust enough.<br /><br />Would I wear these as a daily driver, most likely not as I said they are a completely synthetic boot with a thin black foam on the inside. They would most likely be very hot in the middle of summer. They have two vents near the sole which is good but also may let moisture into the boot. These would be fine cosplay boots, or steam punk fashion for cons and events but I do not think the boots are a daily driver. I purchased them as a close analogous to the Army 1930 calvary lace up I was looking for. J75 made a better analog to that boot but they do not do long runs of boots so once a run is out of stock that boot is gone.<br /><br />The devil is in the details when it comes to a well designed piece of foot wear. As a said previously these are an all synthetic boot from the uppers all the way to the toe. The synthetic leather looks well made and a decent imitation of a true leather product but software to the touch. The upper looks canvas but is a solid synthetic material meant to imitate a canvas material. The sole is a one piece semi soft light grey rubber material which is glued to the boot. the black looking vibram sole is actually a sprayed on black to the one piece rubber sole with the same for the heel. There is the look of a stitched on sole impressed into the sole as well as the look of a layered heel. The glueing seems on these pair of boots to be well done but with time I will see if barge cement has to be used.  Also it is not a heavy boot compared to a similar boot made in leather.<br /><br />So how do they fit? Well they are a half size large, I wear a 10.5 EE and I purchased the size 10 and the front to back was acceptable for a mass built but no half sizes are available. The side to side was a bit tight but with wear that may be okay as they are synthetic and may stretch when worn, but unlike leather will not conform properly.<br /><br />Would I buy again, that is a toss up. This is my first time buying foot wear from this company. I am impressed in the rapid response to questions I had via email. and the boot itself does not look like a cheap mass market chinese boot.  I can purchase an all leather tall cowboy boot with a real vibram sole and true stitching for about 35 dollars more. It of course does not have the lacing and its hardware. I can get a replica of the 1930 boot I want built for me but it is several hundred dollars in all leather with proper stitching which would last me into retirement. I have to say they have some interesting styles that warrant watching this companies designs."
3.0,"The shirt was a little to small, but my husband  loved it anyway. I wore it June 4th on our anniversary. Overall it is nice,but  if you are going to get it buy it one size larger then your regular size."
3.0,The pants are paper thin but they’re still really comfortable and look cute.
3.0,"It's a small cut 2x, the arms are really tight. The quality of the shirt is really good, heavier than a normal tee. It will withstand some wear."
3.0,Bought to tie dye.  Does not take the ink.  Shirt a bit small
3.0,The poker dots are larger than I wanted. They looked small in the picture. Otherwise it is fine.
3.0,"The bottoms are great and fit perfectly, but the top is made for someone with a much bigger chest.  I can wear the top at all unless I feel like flashing everyone at the beach. Itty-bitty committee need not apply."
3.0,"Very good, but the cuff link are oriented vertically what make the somewhat uncomfortable."
3.0,returned... cut for a child yo have to be a very small person to wear this. ordered a xl. not anything what the picture shows. very cheaply made.
3.0,Not as good as other brand I purchased before. This one is even more expensive. Definitely switch back.<br />Give it 3 stars since it still a mask. Not comfortable if I put it on more than 30 minutes
3.0,They had nickel in them so I wasn't able to wear them. they are super cute though!
3.0,Very small and flimsy but for the price its good for disposable  party hats
3.0,"Not so bad, but it’s very big"
3.0,"The slip is a little too short for me, personally, to consider decent. The waist is not stable - just a string to tie it on. I could only wear it with leggings underneath. I haven't decided yet if I'll return it or not. I'm not comfortable wearing it, so I probably should."
3.0,"It's alright, nothing too fancy. I feel it's overpriced. On a positive note - it looks cool hanging on my range bag!"
3.0,"Upon opening the box, you're immediately assaulted by the awful smell of the boots. I understand that the smell will go away with time, not a big deal but definitely unpleasant. You'll make a grand entrance when breaking these puppies in.<br /><br />The style and color are really nice and true to the picture. However, the fit was terrible. Now, I don't have tree trunks for legs. I'd say my calves are pretty average, I wear a size 7 jeans (that might give you an idea of what I mean when I say average). The top of the boots we're cutting off my circulation. I'm pretty sure I was tourniqueting myself from my knee on down. As far as my foot, I should have ordered a whole size down, maybe even a size and a half. I wear a size 8, ordered a 7.5. The boots fit my sister instead, who has canoes for feet at a size 9 (no offense to any size 9 folks. My sister walks around clumsily as if she was wearing canoes on her feet). The boots fit her perfectly so it works out because now she has to deal with smell."
3.0,The product is beautiful but the band and the extra accessory they give with it doesn’t match. One is light gold and the other is a different shade of gold which make the accessory look cheap. I was disappointed.
3.0,"The suspenders themselves looked wonderful and my partner was happy to receive them! However, the buckle on one side is defective and won't &#34;lock&#34; into place which means that side cannot be adjusted to anything but the largest it goes. So disappointed that we couldn't get any use out of these."
3.0,"The boots are comfortable and easy zipper side but the silver cross that I assumed was jewels are a cheaply made fake glued on patch and is already coming off and I only wore the boots for a couple of hours.. I am going to try and glue the peices back on, and thats all I can say"
3.0,Neckline area is a bit tight
3.0,Fits perfectly and the material is nice but it would’ve been better if it had cotton lining.
3.0,"The bottom half of the dress looks odd, with the part that ties."
3.0,Nice but meterial is a bit cheap and it runs small I oder one size bigger and it was to small...overall it ok
3.0,"I liked the product, but it runs large by about 1/2 to 1 inch. The plastic is cheap, there are some areas with extra flash."
3.0,cute for the beach
3.0,I'm returning this shoe.  I wear a 9 d.  I order U.S. 9. The toe box is large and my feet slide front to back the shoe to big.
3.0,Really comfortable dress. I ordered a large and it fits as expected. The black part is a soft jersey material and the skirt is cotton but thick - ish. It is not sheer and cannot be seen through.<br />Part of the seam between the black top and skirt is slightly damaged. It's frayed and the reason for the 3 star rating. Overall - good dress
3.0,"The inseam is 32”. I’m 5’11, 180#. I purchased a large in the royal blue but they’re too short.  Cute pants so I’ll be giving them to a friend."
3.0,"Got this for my husband because the reviews said it was big enough to comfortably fit a 8"" wrist. Either that was a lie or sizing is VERY inconsistent. Edges of the leather didn't even touch on my husband's wrist. Im an extremely small boned woman (4'11"") and it fits me perfectly on the 3rd largest setting, the 3 tightest sweetings are too tight for me. I cant believe this is marketed for men when men typically have larger wrists. Also the leather lacing isn't even adhered so it would easily slip out. Im keeping it for my own pirate weekend costume to avoid the hassle of returning."
3.0,They came just as exspected.
3.0,My aunt had to take darts on sides and
3.0,Some what small if you order get one size bigger. Good klooking.
3.0,Had to return. Run smsll.
3.0,They are much thinner and tighter than advertised. I am a women’s 7.5 size and you can see thru them when on. They do stay up nicely though.
3.0,My son loves these masks. They do stretch after a year.  I bought 2 of the 4-pk pictured and received an 8 pack that included orange and green masks. I was hoping to have less of those this year. Otherwise I would have given a 5 star rating.
3.0,"I really loved this and used it to carry my laptop to and from work.  I used the cross-body strap.  However, the metal hardware of the strap broke after three months, and the stitching where the cross-body strap attached to the purse ripped off the same week.  Love this ourselves but the handles are too short for me to wear comfortably without the cross body strap."
3.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, easy to read but won't last long..poor quality"
3.0,It is cute and fits very comfortably but material was thin so you can see through the skirt. Will wear over a bathing suit or around the house.
3.0,My daughter is a 2t in all her other clothes but this was very snug around her waist and has zero stretch. Not very comfortable at all. Definitely size up!
3.0,"this is the third one of these i have tried to get the size right.  was sent a (i had ordered a large)small, maybe for a baby's christening dress; large - like very small small.  i finally ordered an xxxl and finally it fit.  don't know how it will hold up, but just know this is sized very, very small."
3.0,Cute dress but buy a size up
3.0,It fits OK - doesn't look very nice though - kind of hangs on the body; material is dumpy
3.0,"I really wanted to like these but the long metal part at the end of the threader was very bent, on both. I thought at first it was part of the look, but nah... they were each bent in different ways that really stood out. I have some jewelry tools and tried to straighten this out, but they still looked ""meh."" The threader part was, additionally, thicker than I am used to. Instead, I removed the centerpiece of these -- the coins and quartz tassel part -- and put this bit on some regular fishhook earrings. They're still cute this way, but not really what I was hoping to end up with."
3.0,item was too small and i ordered the size suggested. i am very large chested (32/34 H) so any bra is hit or miss. definitely good quality for the price.
3.0,"It was smaller than I expected it to be, but other than that I liked the feeling of it. On the outside it’s more smooth, and on the inside it’s nice and soft. It’s made of a thin material so it’s not too hot either."
3.0,had to alter it with safety pins
3.0,"I ordered a medium instead of a large and it fit. I usually wear a size 12 and a 36B bra. I'm 5'4&#34; and this is flowy ,but not too long. It has adjustable straps which I like. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is a little too sheer so I need to wear a bra unless I wear it over my bathing suit. It would be awesome if a liner was put into the bra area."
3.0,They kept falling out
3.0,"I love these. I worked at Chili's and made them into a necklace. Only problem is that some of them were broken and the sizing of the holes at the top are inconsistent. If you need this specific number, just order two. Totes cute."
3.0,this dress runs a bit small and is in a very lightweight material  the neckline is extremely low
3.0,nice piece for the price.  Kind of small though.
3.0,Looked cheap not well made but for the price ok.
3.0,I did not realize how small the Kestrel would be on the hat. It can be covered by the tip of my pinky. The hat looks distressed but is still a decent hat. The Kestrel is just super small and looks like an old style iron on transfer and as mine was put on right over the seam on the hat I am afraid it will peel soon.
3.0,"The color was rich and I ordered a size larger and it fit nicely.  The edge of the lace in the front was cut a little crooked, so I had to trim it to make it match, but for the price it is cute."
3.0,"The earrings are large. They are good quality, but they were a lot bigger than what I was expecting."
3.0,"Very pretty, the stones are real. Although the stones being real makes them heavy. So I wish the gauges part it's self was just slightly bigger or that the back part you swist on to keep them in was wider. If I move around a lot it will come right out if my ear with the backing screwed on."
3.0,"The size are really off. In real life I am not a 4xl but, I am a 16/18.this was off on the proportions. Long in the torso, wide in the hip, nothing for bust and the cups in the thing where like for a b cup and moved around the whole suit. It's a cute suit but it's just not made to proportions. It works for my aqua zumba class but the other one by this company is out of the clue. I will spend a little more money for a hopefully better made fitting suit."
3.0,"I loved the color of this band when it first arrived, but after wearing for about a month, it was pretty much a yellow gold color."
3.0,cheapish
3.0,Very cute but runs small on bottoms.
3.0,Not at all what I was expecting.  The fabric is VERY VERY sheer/thin and EXTREMELY see through.  Length was as expected and fit was as expected just disappointed with the quality.  I bought this skirt as part of my Halloween costume and thinking now I'll have to buy something else to put under it.  Price was good considering the  quality.
3.0,The 3-6m fit my 4monther good except in the ankles. It’s very tight to get over foot. Once on its very fitting on ankle if he was “chunky” no chance it would fit. Not sure why they are so tight and not much stretch there.
3.0,I ordered a size up and it’s still too small but my daughter loves it
3.0,"I got the first pair I ordered and I ordered a size 7 for my niece, but when I got them, they said size 7 but it was a very small and very tight size 7! I ordered a size 10 and the pants are just a little long but they fit her perfectly and she’s normally a size 7."
3.0,"I like the watch, but the clip to open it broke the first time I opened it to see the face."
3.0,"This skirt is cute and great for the price. The only I thing I don't like is that the lining on the inside is shorter than the actual skirt and tends to ride up. Also, the skirt runs a little bit small. I ordered an XS and typically wear a 0 or 00, but it was a little snug around the hips."
3.0,"I've was looking for a pair of affordable, low-rise denim pants that look good but are also tough enough to wear while doing yard work.  If you are looking for pants that stretch a lot these are not for you. Personally I don't like stretchy jeans so these were perfect for me. These pants are made of a sturdy but comfortable denim.  According to the tag they are 52% cotton, 48% polyester.. I also like that it has actual working pockets (as all jeans should!) not fake ones.<br />I tried both the 5/6's and 4/3's and the 4/3's fit best for me. I am about 36"" at the hips. I had no issues returning the 5/6's.<br />The only complaints I have is that I did have to hem these pants to make them fit the length (I'm 5'4"" and had to take about 4 inches off the length). Also the 4/3 pants I got were both the same color (the lighter of the two blues shown in the picture). I did not have this issue with the 5/6's.  It would have been nice to have two different colors, but the ones I got are still a nice shade.  I paid a little less for the 4/3 pants so maybe that was why."
3.0,These look nice however some of the holes are not open so you can’t string them and the color is off they don’t look gold more brassy colored
3.0,easily comes a loose and has to constantly be retightened or it comes apart
3.0,Too small for a double wide foot.
3.0,Measurements aren't accurate. It's not bad material but it's shorter than it says.
3.0,Even if it says xxl.  That means size 10-12.
3.0,"Good quality, the problem was with the folded metal at the ends coming loose and scratching and snagging. Still retains good color and I've worn it several times."
3.0,This product hurts my fingers and broke very easily. I first lost the red gem and then it broke completely. I would only buy it for a few times use around Halloween time.
3.0,"The product description claims these are polarized, but they definitely aren't. I wasn't expecting that to be true given the low price but be warned if you buy these expecting polarized lenses for $5 you'll be disappointed."
3.0,Still puzzled with the price differences from M to L as 50% more. It doesn't make any sense. $ 20.00 for M and $ 30.00 for L :-( The M was returned and purchased the L
3.0,"Way too wide for my feet, and I tend to run average width in most shoes."
3.0,Once of the straps was missing
3.0,"Although these clip sunglasses fit my prescription glasses fairly well, there is no top part so you can flip them up while still wearing them, like the pair I had previously.  This means that you have to either take them off when entering a store or leave them on, which is unacceptable.  I'm sorry I bought them & will replace them w/ a pair of clip-ons that has the needed flip-up feature."
3.0,"Does its job, but not very well made."
3.0,"Unfortunately, The items delivered to me brocken before I use it as shown in the photos. Moreover, the size is not accurate as descriped. I am very disappointed of the product quality. I need my money back."
3.0,"They fit my face well and are comfortable, but they are a matte black instead of a gloss black which would make them nicer.  They feel cheap like gas station $5 glasses.  They are OK at best."
3.0,"These are nice for a holiday surprise.  I would probably add a ""Merry"" to the top or just before the ""Christmas"".  Polyester design.  Stay away from flames :)"
3.0,"These weren't terrible, but I ended up returning because A. the check print didn't line up on the front or back seams which was bothersome (btw there is no way to tell which side is the front/back) and B. they didn't lay flat and were a big poofy. I probably could have made them work but I didn't know if it was worth taking the risk."
3.0,They are a nice thick socks. Just a few thing I wasn't satisfied with I wear a eight inch boot and they don't come to the top and the size runs on the smaller than stated and that might have caused one pair to already have a hole in them.
3.0,Many arrived not working.
3.0,only adds a little room. a bit tight to put on the button. it does give you a little more room
3.0,It’s just a hat nothing special about it. Wasted my money
3.0,very cute but tiny but exactly what i wanted. the only prob is that one of the earrings the post is very loose and defective. should be checked for quality control before shipping out. returning.
3.0,The finishing isn’t great. It will do for home use
3.0,"Cute 3 stars, size is really small compared to 🇺🇸 sizes. I ordered xl they were more like a medium"
3.0,"Beautiful patterned shirt, but unfortunately upon opening had a stain on it. Got it out by scrubbing with a rag thankfully."
3.0,it was smaller than expected but its still cool
3.0,it protects the phone basically but the edges of the tempered glass chips and cracks easily
3.0,It’s an alright jacket but more like sweatshirt material. Definitely not something you want to wear in the cold cold. It is stylish good for like 40-50 degree weather. Big Downside is the pocket lining is white on my black jacket and it stands out. Also the pockets run super high up so hard to get ur hands in them... but stylish so 3 stars
3.0,"Great Fitting Belt!!  Only problem is I have to do a hand stand every time I want to open a beer.  Fun, but hard."
3.0,"The sweater is really cheap looking and feeling. It has more of a yellow tinge to it so it is not a true khaki. The buttons are smaller than pictured as well. The sizing is as expected, somewhat large. Ok for the price to wear on an inside on the couch by the fire kind of day."
3.0,"This sweater is nice and comfy. The only problem is that I have had it a short time (less than 2 months) with not a lot of wear, and the threads are starting to get loose and poke out."
3.0,I like the actual cross. The chain was cheap looking and would have like better if the chain went through the cross
3.0,"They sent me the wrong color. They are soft, warm.<br />Run big."
3.0,"This jacket is fine and comfortable. I considered sending it back because the buttons make a lot of noise which makes it seem lower quality. My biggest complaint is that the shirt was caught in the packaging and has plastic heat pressed on to the lower seam from where it was caught in the package sealing process, that will not come off. You get what you pay for. Still versatile and looks very cute on."
3.0,I love Fila!  I am a hair stylist and stand all day on my feet. The Dashtech was prefect how I can not longer fine them. I am trying these for the 1st time. They seem to run a little on the small side. I wear a 7 in a normal shoe and an 8 in tennis shoes. Looks like I will need an 8 1/2 in this one.
3.0,To long. I’m only 5’10”. 194 lbs. They are very comfortable though. Going to buy large instead of xl
3.0,I ordered multi color but only got black and gray.
3.0,This is VERY thin material.  Expect your bra to show through.
3.0,"Material is overall thicker than expected - due to inside surplus seams. However, now it's a little cooler nice with sneakers"
3.0,Just a standard crappy ring. You're getting what you pay for.
3.0,"A little flimsy, a little cheap. But made my daughters heart happy. Better suited to hang from a mirror and warm your heart upon noticing each time you pass it than wearing."
3.0,Completely wrong size when arrived. I chose not to exchange because internal padding was thin and did not appear supportive. Zero arch support.
3.0,Upper sleeves are small
3.0,Hell I'm grown and I can wear the size 4 myself and I wear a 8 in women😡
3.0,"Nice size and weight. Shiny gold, not matte.<br />Perfect for every day."
3.0,"One of my earrings appears to be constructed so that it is upside down.  For me, it is not worth returning, but I would say that it can't be depended on to be correctly put together.  They are pretty, however, and do not look cheap.  They look like a nice piece of fashion jewelry, and I will probably wear them once in a while."
3.0,I like this but I have to baby them because of the substandard stitching. I have to put them on very carefully and slowly to ensure that I do no over stretch the stitching which could go any day now. Other wise I like them and I think for the price you get a decent set of pants.
3.0,"I got the Lilac dress, it ended up being quite sheer, I wish the fabric was made up of better quality material, also I’m normally a medium in dressed and I found this dress to be quite right around my chest (I’m roughly a Gcup) but I’m also 4’11, I’m just curve for my size lol so if you are short and a bit thick per say, maybe go up a size. But sizing up would be a bit of an issue because the waist line is a bit baggy 😅 tight on my burst and back side but baggier on my waist."
3.0,Shirt was too short and way too small
3.0,"The print was pretty illegible on this mask type and the blacks were pretty spotty. The mask itself passes the candle blow test without the included filters, which is nice, and the fit is good but the print was deeply underwhelming."
3.0,"Perfect for business casual. The black strip lining the buttons looks cute but really stands out. I didn't love the look of it. I tried a few sizes, and the one that fit best in the chest was very baggy everywhere else. Didn't love it but if it fits you well, it's cute enough. Just not short professional looking."
3.0,This suit is very cute but the fit was wrong.  I am 5'6 and 168 pounds.  I wear a size 10 and a 38 D bra.  I ordered the XL and the top was too small.  The bottoms were almost too big and I am afraid if I ordered a size up the bottoms would not fit at all.
3.0,"5’7.5”, 135lbs and they are a bit too short in size M. I’d like were they longer.  Pants can be hemmed, but not extended. They should have cut longer. Planning to sew into pencil/ankle pants. They will then lose the 70’s look, and have more of a golden era 40’s look, worn with a crisp white tailored look shirt, with rolled cuffs. Or, at least I “think” will be end result. I like the idea of placing hook & eye at top of zipper, to keep it up,  another reviewer gave. Will do that while at it. Will post."
3.0,"It's nice, just like the picture except I only got the shirt. For $9 it's okay and I would have kept it but it was a bit tight in the stomach area so I returned it and am going to order a size bigger. I normally wear l/xl and I purchased an xl. Otherwise I really like it. Feels nice and I love the lace parts and it's super cheap! Win win"
3.0,More purple than burgundy.<br />Beautiful tie.
3.0,"Construction was great, unfortunately the upper section isn’t simply clear so my vision was made worse. The up close/reading section was perfect."
3.0,"I have several stretch bangle gemstone bracelets of varying types. The one I received is a light green-slightly blue in appearance. I was looking for one to match a necklace I bought. I admit this is a very difficult thing to do on line.<br /><br />In the past, I have been very happy with the pieces of jewelry that have come from Gem Stone King. This is the only one I am not too crazy about. It is a good size, and has a good stretch. I have to say, it doesn't look like howlite to me, but I am not an expert. It looks like resin. Some of the elastic is somewhat sloppy, and not cut well, with elastic string showing.<br /><br />It has a dull appearance. Perhaps, I am most disappointed that the color is not as pictured. If you are more open about the color selection, this could work for you."
3.0,"These were awesome just to stand in. Not to walk around in. You definitely can bend over or your butt will hangout. Also, sequence will rub off between your legs. Did great for one-time kinda thing.<br />I'm also only 5'2 and they came above my ankles."
3.0,"Loved the pattern, which is why I ordered in the first place. Very disappointing, the size was way too small,  even using their size charts."
3.0,"They get uncomfortable behind the ears after some time, and they leave a red mark on the bridge of my nose. They came with a blue light and reactive paper to prove they work, so that was pretty cool."
3.0,Not really sure if it did anything positive but discontinued because of a strange headache I was waking up with.  Stopped the supplement and the headache went away.
3.0,"Runs small so size up for a relaxed, cozy fit. Not the softest material but hoping it softens in the wash."
3.0,Come super wrinkle and it took us some washing and drying to get the brim just right. It does offer a lot of sun protection.
3.0,Pretty but not great quality.
3.0,"Expected tight wrist band to hold on hand, doesn't so well.  Also top of sleeve doesn't tighten with pull string or anything, so not really flush to prevent snow from getting in.  But it is long enough that even if snow gets in, it won't get to hand.  The slipping off is the bigger issue.  Anything smaller and we wouldn't have been able to get 3 yr old's hand in the glove, so not a size issue."
3.0,These are really cute earrings but I should have known they could have been difficult for  me to put on and take off.  The earrings are easy enough to put on but the clear disk backing for the posts are difficult for me to use.
3.0,It's very soft but for it to be oversized like the picture I should have gone up 2 or 3 sizes. I wanted it to be like it picture. I did keep it though bc it's cute just not what I was wanting.
3.0,"This bralette does not have adjustable straps and was too big, even though I’m busty. Returning."
3.0,"This shirt is so cute! I just wish it fit better. I ordered one size up because it looked like the rayon type material that shrinks in the wash, and it’s still a little snug. After washing I’m not sure it would even fit at all. I would recommend ordering at least 1-2 sizes bigger than normal."
3.0,"It’s a basic dress. The pockets are nice, the fabric is soft, and the blue was a vibrant color. I bought it to wear as part of my costume, so I can’t say whether it will hold up to multiple washings.<br />My husband wasn’t impressed—he didn’t think it was flattering (it clings to my midsection easily)."
3.0,"Has it for a month, showing a little wear on the back.  Overall not a bad band."
3.0,I ordered a size XL and were too small.  My waist is a 40 so I ordered an XXL and they also were too small.
3.0,"I purchased this about 2-3 yrs ago, recently we noticed that 2 of the bottom winders stopped working... I wonder how we can fix this or how long is the warranty?  It’s little<br />Disappointing how this winder is not working after couple years... I would appreciate it if some contact me and direct us to next step and fix this issue.."
3.0,One of the buttons fell off on the second time she wore them.  These are jean type buttons so I had to buy a replacement kit.
3.0,"5'3&#34; 32c, 125lbs size small Disclaimer: this isn't a bad dress, it just wasn't what I expected. I have a lot of off the shoulder dresses but what caught my eye about this one was how cute and bouncy the ruffles looked. The dress I got just didn't have that bounce at all and just kind of fell flat. I looked at other reviews in the different colors and the frills still looked bouncy but for whatever reason mine just didn't. The price point is good but I do know that for this type of item, for a few dollars more, I can get something that just has a little more life. The fabric was thin but not bad, that part is how I expected it to be. I just have too many that do a similar thing so I'm returning this one but, again, it's definitely not a bad dress, just was hoping for something a little closer to the photo. See pics to judge for yourself :)"
3.0,"This sports bra by Everrywell is too small.<br />I tried to put it on and I couldn’t.<br />I wear a 34D bra.  According to the Size Chart I should wear a Large, so that’s what I bought.  After seeing the note that the model’s Chest is 35.4” (according to the size chart she should wear a Medium) and is wearing a Small, I was a little afraid it would be too big.  I was very wrong.<br />It is so small when I tried to put it on, I couldn’t.<br /><br />It does feel well made.<br />The pads are not removeable, so I’m a little afraid they will roll up during washing, as can happen with this type of bra.<br />The straps are not adjustable, that could be a problem.<br /><br />I give this 3 starts because the size chart is wrong, the straps could be a big problem, and the inner pads feel like they are going to roll around."
3.0,it's pretty thin but it does what i bought it for
3.0,Cute on...wore ...for one event and it broke
3.0,Made me look like I worked at Sephora
3.0,Sizes doesn't Match at all
3.0,She couldn't handle the tight fit so she had to go one size then it was fine.
3.0,"Shirt looks great, until it is washed. The black bleeds easily onto the yellow, even when washed as instructed."
3.0,Easy to replace.  Clipped securely into frame.  Cheaper than replacing sunglasses.  Works as it should.
3.0,Material and size are fine  but the white zipper makes the “secret compartment” really stand out.  Not good.
3.0,"Cute dress<br />Nylon type material<br />Does not shrink<br />Tight In chest as it’s form fitting .<br />But my “overall view” of “all” the swing dresses is...<br />They look cute on looking straight into mirror.<br />And, they feel good on (right now) not summer months but, ... if you were to video or film yourself in this dress you’d notice it does absolutely nothing for your backside buttocks. (That’s if you’re more flat back there)<br />I saw this “only” after using a phone tripod . It was not appealing . Not appealing at all & to much material in the swing. Who knew, besides a phone tripod!<br />I ordered medium swing dresses. M. were tight in the chest so I went to large (my bust size is 38) Weight is 128-130 . I noted a difference in the Large being a bit more room (at the top) but still.. these dresses are tight no matter what size you choose In the bust area especially if you have “the girls” sitting up firm & high (to quote a old song)<br />I Suggest/ wear a bra. I just happen to be a older, young at heart, gal who is of the flower child generation... refusing to give into age."
3.0,"Dress is comfortable and easy to wear. The skirt is more sheer than I expected and is unlined, so a slip is necessary."
3.0,Not a bad hat but the logo is simply printed on and not stitched or anything. Not an expensive hat though so overall worth it. Unfortunately it doesn’t fit my big head but if you have an average size hat it’ll probably fit you fine.
3.0,I have a small wrist.  I ordered a number of these and they almost fit for children.
3.0,Perfect fit when I got them getting larger the more I wear them
3.0,Fun costume junk to mess around with while considering a fitting for the real deal.
3.0,SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASURES
3.0,The light feature is the worst!
3.0,"Nice looking, but is very large, not for a man with small wrists.  It's now my desk clock."
3.0,"I really liked the way the back of this romper looks. The one size fit okay but, could've been a little tighter. I didn't like the shoulder area because it was not very snug. This made it a little difficult to stay on my shoulders. Plus, the romper came with 2 holes in the sleeves. Therefore, I am returning it."
3.0,The material was very thick and nice 👍The dress appeared to be very nice for a formal affair. It ran much bigger than I expected. Wish I would have bought the right size.
3.0,"It was pretty, but not the quality I expected with other dress makers. Returned and bought from another seller"
3.0,The sizing was really small. The ties for the back were really short for ordering a large. Fyi: you need a lot of assistance putting it on and adjusting the back.
3.0,"I love these pants. They are absolutely gorgeous and stylish. But they run very small. I can get them closed, but they're not comfortable when they're fully zipped, despite following the sizing chart. I am reluctant to exchange them because I'm on the short side of average and I'd be worried a larger size would be longer. I'm going to see if I can make them work bc other than being a bit tight they are perfect."
3.0,"Runs super small! I got size large and they are bearly even small. If you order, order 2 sizer larger then normal! The material is nice and feels like it would be warm."
3.0,The chain that came with it is very thin the clasp already broke. the diamond itself is very beautiful
3.0,This is cute but the gold looks very fake.
3.0,Little to small for me.
3.0,"The colors are gorgeous and bright. It is a soft fabric and fits well. It slides down but I expected this with the scrunchie top. My only  problem is the dress is not centered!!!! In the picture you can see the the birds coming together in the middle, its off to the side on my dress. Even so, I still get a lot of compliments on the dress and I think I'll just re-center it myself."
3.0,Ok so I bought 2 of these vest one for myself the other for my girlfriend. The heated back panel works great but the front panels barely work. The vest take a couple mins to warm up but on the highest setting (red) and on for 30mins and the front panel still ain’t giving out any heat I thought it might have just been my vest but the 2nd one same thing. I don’t think I’d buy this vest again and I wouldn’t recommend it to any friends or family.
3.0,For the price it looks pretty good. Though the dial is little big for my wrist. I replaced the leather band with another light weight steel band and it looks good.
3.0,ordered a medium pair of pants. The pants were to short and to small around the waist.
3.0,Its okay i liked the material of the top but the bottom is not long its three quarters and of a very different material overall an ok outfit
3.0,Falls a couple of inches above ankles for a person 5’3” must have it himmed.
3.0,I received a top that was pre warn as the label in the top was cut out. I purchased a new top to be disappointed that someone wore it first then returned it to Amazon. Amazon sold it to name as a new top. Unacceptable!
3.0,I'm a 1x or 2xl in clothes and this is way to tight and not comfortable. The back zipper is almost impossible especially on something that is this tight. The white is very cute but I'm going to have to alter it to wear it. I'm 5'6 200lbs
3.0,Super cute! But the material has no barring on my body makeup. It had my chest looking like a flat pancake and I am only a 36B. Maybe a larger size would fix that but then the bottom would fit differently.
3.0,This top is a bit large at the waist line... It doesn't have the waist line cut properly.
3.0,"I thought I should let other buyers know I'm a (size 12) just average, and would like to share how this &#34;bra&#34; fits me.<br />The shoulder straps are comfortable, the back is comfortable, although they should have made this garment TAG-LESS, since there are two tags hanging in the inside back,,,uncomfortable and scratchy.<br />The problem with this &#34;bra&#34; is the bottom band rolls up and no matter how much you adjust it it stills wants to ROLL UP under the girls,  constantly pulling it down..ugh!!! and the straps are one piece so you can't adjust it there.<br /> BECAUSE of this, I will not order again, If they modified the bottom part of the garment it would be an excellent choice."
3.0,"These are ok. When I first took them out of the package they seemed great. But when you put them on they are not as soft as you'd expect or want and then when you put shoes on, they rub the already rough material against your toes and the bottom of your foot. Not comfy. I can wear thin liner socks underneath and they don't bother me as much. But I was disappointed."
3.0,"Super cute, but stretchy and tighter fit so order up! I am usually a large, but really glad that I got an xxL."
3.0,I usually wear a medium in almost everything but this brand in particular runs quite small even for compression gear. Everything hugs in the right places and the fabric quality is very good but make sure you order a size up. For ref i am 5ft7 155lbs Athletic build. I would need a Large for this instead of medium as they run small.
3.0,"Saw this shirt on someone else and thought it was so cute, but I have a larger chest size (36 DD) and it just felt a snag too tight, and the material didn’t sit correctly because of my larger breasts. The material wasn’t too bad (not see through) and I love the tie in the back/backless effect. Sad I have to return this."
3.0,It is s pretty cool purse
3.0,"The end cap does NOT close properly and opens at unexpected times on its own, it therefore can easily be lost."
3.0,"For USA size, it's to small, does not fit I ordered a 2x still too small."
3.0,A bit bulky and the strings can be annoying. Cute though
3.0,"I've purchased several of the &#34;Catit&#34; products for my cat. I was impressed with this fountain for it's water filtration properties. My cat took to it immediately, but after having it a week now, he's lost interest. I tried it with and without the flower. No luck.  He's returned to preferring to drink water from his water dish or the kitchen sink faucet."
3.0,Overall. They do the job and they're better than the cheap ones i find at Ross. I usually wear a 36D but have been realizing that I might be wearing them too big. I ordered a 36D and had to return because they were way too big. I then re-ordered a 34D and they find good except that it gives me a huge gap when i'm sitting normally. not even squishing my boobs. I can easily give everyone a show.
3.0,The PJs are comfy but the bottoms bled during wash so some parts look a little blended on the stripes.
3.0,"I so wanted to love these but, after ordering 3 pair in small, medium, and large, I can't find a fit I like. They are well made and toasty warm and the colors are great. However, there is no real difference in length. The large size had a HUGE waist. I could barely get into the small. The medium size was okay but just fit oddly being on the short side. I am 5'8"", 137lbs, 27"" waist, 38"" hips, and 32"" inseam. Perhaps it matters which color you get? I got the pink in sm and lg and the tan in medium."
3.0,Material not thick enough
3.0,"I bought the white dress and it was super cute, but kind of see-through. Ended up having to send it back. Also, the package and the dress reeked of garlic when I got it. Washed twice with no luck getting the scent out."
3.0,Pretty dress but not flattering for my larger figure
3.0,The color is not as vibrant as the the picture. The material doesn’t feel soft it’s too much polyester.
3.0,"Dress was a bit too short, hits right at my ankles. I am 5'5 and bought a large. It's a bit see through and the material is clingy."
3.0,I think you have to have a super flat stomach to pull off this fit. Quality was OK but not for me.
3.0,"This is just okay. I think I will be sending mine back. The stones a glued on, and couple of them on mine a crooked. Also, one of the stones has glue on the front. The design and materials are good, but it is not executed well. Perhaps mine was the only one with a problem? I am not sure I will re-order. I need to think about it."
3.0,Fits sort of large. Thought it might fit tight so I ordered a medium I'm 6'1 150 b cup. So consider me slim. I'm normally a 6 depending on style<br />And cut but this medium is more of a 7 I believe.
3.0,I really like the design but it runs large could of gotten a size or two smaller.
3.0,I am 57 and weigh about 200 I am bigger from the waist up so I wear like a one next to a 2X top but I wear a 14 jeans what size Lulu row leggings do I need
3.0,I thought they had a cap
3.0,"No era lo que queria pues la queria de hilo, mas no la Halle. pero por lo de mas leg antes de Tiempo, y lo que no me gusto fue que la compare para regalo y no fue empaquetada para regalo."
3.0,I ordered a LG and had to give them to my daughter who is a Sm. They are cute though just for smaller women for sure.
3.0,"I wear a xl in all shirts. I ordered an xl in this shirt and the arms and chest area are way too tight. I’m in a 40 D.<br />But it is a super cute shirt. I’m hoping the xxl fits better.<br />Also I bought a black one exactly like it from the same company, same listing and it’s different material and fits great ."
3.0,I think they these are girl sized and not baby or toddler as they suggest. They are very big around.rose is cute though. The seller contacted me and sent me some smaller ones however.
3.0,"This purse is very cute but too small. Would be good for a teen or someone who doesn't carry much in their purse, & only likes to carry it on their arm. Straps not long enough for your shoulder."
3.0,"This is a little duffle bag, not as large as the photos make it appear. It's not large enough for a weekend trip by any stretch. It's best suited as a gym bag perhaps or to carry electronic stuff with your clothing in a different bag. The leather is ok, not high quality, but not thin garbage either. This won't be my go to bag or replace my good leather luggage, but it's fine as a back up in a pinch."
3.0,"The fit was a little weird for me.  The neck and shoulders just didn't lay right as pictured.  The wide band at the bottom hugged my bottom tightly, but if I wore it lower it looked like and 80's dress.  Thin fabric, I will probably just wear around the house."
3.0,It's okay for a throwaway watch.  The good is it is solar powered. The bad the instruction sheet is wrong and as of yet I can't shut the alarm off permanently.
3.0,"I'm 5'4 and about 160lbs. I'm small chested and carry most of my weight in my thighs. I typically wear medium or large in maxi dresses. Based on the reviews I ordered a medium. I could have gone with a small for this dress. Also, the fabric is not how it looks in the photo. If I came across this dress in a store I'm not sure I would have purchased it."
3.0,Good for the cost I guess actually you get more than you paid for just not t what I was expecting as far as the slight differences in pictures
3.0,"Nice material, but they fit a little snug in the waist and thighs with little give."
3.0,Kids liked them. The noise it makes is pretty annoying.
3.0,"it was ok, the color looked like Pepto-Bismol kind of pink, rather than the pastel ballet pink on my screen."
3.0,"This apron traps hair on the stomach. It gets itchy. I’m going to have it altered so the button down area is sewn shut to see if that helps. As far as looks and fit, I love it."
3.0,It ripped and ran bigger
3.0,"At 5'3&#34;  145, this shirt shows my middle roll.  Period.  I ordered size large (12/14) based on others' comments.  It fits through shoulders and bust.  I think it is a very nice shirt, love the material, love the &#34;cuff&#34; at the end of longer sleeves,  Love the fabric color and feel, but it is too small for me through the middle, and next size would be too big.  It is fitted over the hips, which is OK, as not every thing has to be full and floaty.  It would fit a taller person nicely too.  I'm going to see if my daughter-in-law would like it.  She is tall and thin.  Also, I usually find the henley look a little to masculine on me.  This is not.  It's pretty, it just does not take well to a 34&#34; waist and what goes with it."
3.0,I was so excited to get this Dr. Fauci mask but I can’t wear it. It’s too small.
3.0,No stretch if you have larger breasts and smaller waist may be hard to fit
3.0,"Cheap, it consumes itself... Have it foe 3 months just ordered one of silicone. Loved the color!!! but this is recyclable... Material not for lastin time"
3.0,"These did not work for me at all, I guess my calfs are too big but gave them to a family member who has a foot 3 sizes smaller and smaller calfs and they felt they were tight also."
3.0,Super cute shirts but way too small. Definitely order a size or 2 up. My daughter normally wears a size 10 and we ordered the size 12 and it is way too small. The size 12 fit more like a size 7/8.
3.0,"Beautiful earring, got a lot of compliments on these! Sparkly and perfect for christmas season. However they broke after 4 times of wearing them. Did not wear to bed or in the shower. But stones all came out of one earring after the 4th use. Really sad, these were perfect"
3.0,"I got this for a trip to an amusement park, as I wanted to keep my phone and money with me without placing them in my pockets, (I've lost things this way!) or lugging around a purse.  It did its job, but was very flimsy, breaking my the end of the second day.  The colors were cute and the see through pocket feature worked to some extent, but I mainly just removed the phone when I needed it.  I was not rough on it at all, just wore it for two days on a slow paced trip around Epcot- no big rides or situations that would have put undue stress on it.  I didn't expect it to last too long, just maybe more than one trip."
3.0,"Really cute and I like it BUT,  I work in an office and 1st time having it on the stones (several stones fall off). I ordered 2 one for me and one for a friend.  I don't think I will give the other one to anyone.  Worried it will fall apart like mine is after only wareing 1 time."
3.0,"Ordered and received my watch band in a timely manner, however the band was defective. The problem was with the mechanism that slides into the watch itself. One side was broken which would cause it to get stuck and or pop apart, making it unusable. I would have gave the company a second chance but there was no option to be sent a new one, so I annoyingly had to return and buy from another company."
3.0,"I have a big head... and I knew that going in; it &#34;fits&#34; but doesn't really stay on well.  I also find it to be a bit TOO floppy (though I know it's supposed to be) or maybe it's floppy in the wrong place; if I wear it front-ways, with the tag in the back, it pretty much covers my eyes.  One feature that I was really thankful for, is that it had loops to be able to put a drawstring through, so at least when it falls off my head, or the wind blows it backwards, it's still around my neck.  I purchased it for fishing, and found that I had to take it off to cast and reel in, but again, with a drawstring, that was alright."
3.0,It rides up and the lace is scratchy!
3.0,Cute and simple rose ... Great with black and white outfit.
3.0,"It's a nice kippa, but the picture is slightly misleading. The actual product has much larger spaces between material"
3.0,This is the first collar I bought for my mature girlfriend. A little on the cheap side and the heart is not to sturdy. Still does the job though when my girlfriend is dressed as a slave maid for role play. It's small enough that she has even worn it out in public.
3.0,Am an XS in most department stores. This fit great. The only thing is the bottom is little lopsided looking but not noticeable too much on mine. Fabric is better than expected.
3.0,El color es diferente al que se muestra. Pensé que era original
3.0,I like it but the hangers are breaking after a while. I don’t think I’m putting much weight on them for this to happen. I just put one purse on each.
3.0,The bottoms fit great but the top is a bit short and cuts weirdly on me. I returned it.
3.0,"Fit & look good, help with night driving but not as much as hoped., would not purchase again."
3.0,"It's okay, not at all what I expected, on model it looks very wide which it isn't at all even after you fold the figure 8  and wrap it 2 or 3 times."
3.0,"The bifocal “stickers” aren’t even on both lenses. It’s not by much, a couple millimeters, but makes a huge difference when you have them on your face and you’re trying to look thru the edge of a sticker with one eye. Stickers can’t be repositioned without ruining them. Why the sticker can’t go edge to edge along the whole bottom of the lenses in these bifocals is a mystery to me. I probably looked at 1000 pairs on amazon before purchasing these. I write this with my head cocked to the left to get a clear view through both stickers. Not for all day all around wear. These are a small lens pair of glasses. I would recommend larger lenses glasses with more clear view area for all day wear. But, for sitting still to read and also look up to watch tv, they’re fine. Won’t be buying again. They’re not serving the purpose of all day wear, which is what I was shopping for,  without having to take them on and off to see both close and far away as I did anyways with my dollar store cheaters."
3.0,"too small, and the came with a broken zipper.  super cute, though"
3.0,quite a few imperfections on this A line dress due to the hook and eye closure.
3.0,"BEAUTIFUL earrings however, there isn't a hole for studs to go into."
3.0,DOES THE JOB BUT I WOULD NOT TRUST THEM WEARING A TOOL BELT WORKS GOOD WITH A PAIR OF SHORTS
3.0,These are okay! Cute except some wings came out crooked and lots were “dirty” looking
3.0,"Its very flimsy, its not worth the money."
3.0,They are not purple.  They are clear but very pretty.
3.0,"It's pretty, but smaller than I thought. The price was the attraction. A cute and fun little bit of jewelry."
3.0,I like it but it's missing a stone. I will have to wear it like that because I have a deadline
3.0,"It’s cute and I really liked it but it’s too small. My iPhone 8 Plus took up all of the room on the inside pocket. Also, no individual credit card and ID slots-just a little pocket that is bigger than and credit card and ID slot to hold that, some cash and maybe a thin tube of lip gloss. Super cute and a beautiful bag but way too small. 😢"
3.0,beautiful but way too long and a bit wider than expected. I'm in between sizes so that's understandable but still super long
3.0,"It's okay, too big for my toes and it doesn't adjust very much. Very pretty though!"
3.0,ITS BIGGER THAN ME
3.0,The pockets are odd and don't flow well with the shirt.
3.0,My skinny little twig 6 year old barely fits in here. She’s maybe 43 lbs & this is skin tight on her. I’m afraid she will only be able to wear it this year until recital then done.
3.0,I usually wear a medium. Even the large is too small.
3.0,"The colors are great, material , silkey and on the thin side."
3.0,"Honestly...very cute, but it doesn't stay on the finger. Comes off very easy. It was okay."
3.0,Nowhere nearly as vivid as the photo showed - very washed-out looking.
3.0,"I ordered two of these. They're cute, but I don't particularly enjoy the fit and the material is pretty rough. I don't mind owning them, but I probably wouldn't order again."
3.0,Cute but runs very small. Also the color was supposed to be beige but it was very yellow.
3.0,they are decent but only for not really cold weather . they are very thin boots but for show they work  the price. Id buy them again but I do live in Florida! Not really boot weather
3.0,Glasses are fine but strap/cord attached is cumbersome. The strap does keep me from dropping glasses but not very practical for everyday use.
3.0,The wheels on these tend to get stuck in the extended position and/or the door to the wheel doesn't close.
3.0,"It is what it says, does what it says, but not a great device. It should do enough slow down a determined crook or at least make them look for an easier target.  For whatever it's worth, it fits on both my small equipment trailer and my golf cart with over-sized tires."
3.0,It fits tight in the arms unlike the first and third ones I purchased and it has a strong chemical smell to it unlike the other two I've purchased.
3.0,"Horse figure looks a little cartoonish. Other than that, for the price it is fine."
3.0,Love the pattern. Would have preferred the earring to sit on the earlobe rather than off it.
3.0,Jackets good really about 2 smaller sizes than american sizes good when paired with a coat over it.
3.0,"While I am not as skinny as the model pictured, the dress didn't fit as loosely as I anticipated. For someone just a hair on the short side (5'4&quot;), the dress was a bit too long to wear with flats. To me it wasn't terrible, but not great either."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this coat! Problem was, the zipper broke in the middle and I literally had to take the coat off by sliding it down off me. I was surprised because it has a great metal zipper. I ordered another one, the next size larger cause I tend to wear bulky sweaters in the winter and maybe it was too bulky for the zipper?"
3.0,Didn't look as cute as it did in the picture. Ran so big I end up giving it away to my best friend.
3.0,"Really cute dress for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She’s a little below average for her age and had to reorder the 6T for her and that just fits. It’s also not sewn real well. The first time she wore it, 2 seams came apart so had to sew both spots."
3.0,Just average flip flops.
3.0,Very wonderful material however mine came with neck like poped and a bit too latge but it will cost too much to send it back so im just stuck with it
3.0,"good thing they shipped 2, because the first one broke after 3 weeks, I like where they were going with the mechanism but they used inferior materials for the buckle. there is a small pin in the sizing clamp that tore the mount holes out one morning.<br />the quick release is nice, but the male side doesn't fit through any of my belt loops so I have to click the belt together and release the sizing lever every time I change pants out which, to me defeats the purpose of the quick release mechanism.<br />also, being a rather large man, the release levers dig into my gut whenever I sit down which gets uncomfortable quickly.<br />they could have put the adjustment on the same side as the female end, and drastically reduced the size of the male end so that it would fit through the belt loops without having to change the length position every time I thread it onto a new pair of pants."
3.0,Beautiful dress but fits 2 sizes too small. So disappointed. The spandex material is very tight so you will need to go up a couple sizes.
3.0,"Loose and comfortable, but unflattering. I will wait until I can wear it with tights and a fitted jacket over it."
3.0,"Not the best quality. Very sparse feathers, can see the rope hanging out, and feathers fell out very very easily. However it gets 3 stars for being inexpensive compared elsewhere, which is great since we only needed it Halloween night."
3.0,"Wig is styled (instead of made permanently) in this fashion. It comes undone very easily. If you don't know how to style wig, find something that comes set."
3.0,The dress is really cute but it's sheer and the neckline is too low
3.0,Lens fell out first day
3.0,Neck seams frayed from piping.
3.0,"Beautiful shoes. However, they are not true to size. Not even close."
3.0,Its a little thin and somewhat see through. The slit is quite high I wish it was a little lower and on both sides.
3.0,Cute. Runs small. Fabric was nice and the colors were pretty. I ended up giving it to my daughter as it was too small for me.
3.0,"The fit runs small.  I’m 5’10” and 180 pounds.  The 2x fits snug but has great shape.  It hits below the belt line so if you like your jackets long, you may not like this one.  It’s on the short side."
3.0,"I bought this for my son who is a vet tech. He loved it.  However it is too short. He is 5'5"" and if he raises his arms, his belly sticks out. I have worn scrubs all my life and never seen a top made so short. Think I will just buy a plain one and make another on with my cricket that FITS him cuz he really liked it.  Disappointed."
3.0,"I wish the socks came in a large size, say 11-12.  Then, I would have a little more comfort.  Also, the toe area should be made a little stronger, instead of looking like a tear is about to happen."
3.0,Giving these 3 stars only because they don't go over the knee. You have to be a rather short person for these to make it that far up your leg. They are very cute otherwise and they come just under my knee but I bought them to go with over the knee boots. So sad and I'm only 5'4&#34;. Not particularly tall. The material is nice and they are not overly thick. Good quality.
3.0,"Kind of cheap material, but it looks better on.  It's kind of sexy with the high slit.  For the price I can't complain."
3.0,Much shorter then expected. I have to use it as a tunic but works well for that function. Material same as rularow.
3.0,"Like this dress, but a bit to big"
3.0,"This was cute, but wasn't what I was looking for. May be a fit for someone else though."
3.0,"Ok, but would be nicer if they were smaller"
3.0,"it doesn’t have paws 🐾 for the feet area as shown in the picture. Otherwise it seems warm, however I returned mine."
3.0,"This dress is super cute and really soft, but the top is tiny. I’m pregnant and thought this would make a great dress to wear throughout my pregnancy. My bust is a 36B/C. I am a pre-pregnancy size10/12. I bought a large and the top is soooooo small. With the help of unbuttoning a few of the top buttons, the dress fits and still looks cute without exposing my chest. Gonna keep it but wish the top was a bit bigger."
3.0,don't like how the socks curl down...colors are great but they are thin.<br />They are okay and I will wear them but was less of what I expected.
3.0,"The product is pretty nice, but I was expecting the grass green color I ordered. Instead I got a lime green."
3.0,Cute top but is that jersey material that is more clingy and runs a bit large. I am 5'4 140 lbs and got this in a size Small which was too big for me! I would need an XS but it won't be in stock until July so I'm debating rebuying. Definitely comfortable though but the material is just not my thing although I like the style.
3.0,I thought it would be like the picture display but it was much smaller than I expected and it didn't fix any chain or the bracelet I wanted it to go on so I couldn't use them but I didn't discard them either. So I wasn't totally please
3.0,The masks are just like what was supposed to come! They were late by a day but worked out.
3.0,"After having cataract surgery in both eyes a few years ago, I find that I need readers in a variety of strengths for different activities:  computer work, reading printed books, needlework, etc.  So I tend to purchase a lot of readers and I'm always on the lookout for styles/designs that will work in a variety of settings including outdoors.  So readers combined with sunglasses are a definite plus for me.  Even more attractive are bifocal readers that allow me to look up from reading and still focus on the scenery around me (I do a lot of cruise travel in balcony cabins ... )<br /><br />These are nearly perfect as bifocal sunglass readers go.  I love the shape, the frame, the fit, the case -- everything.  There's one flaw, however:  the bifocal ""line"" -- that actual cut in the lens below which the bifocal ""reading"" lens is placed -- is just a little too low for these to work comfortably ""as is.""  In order to see clearly through the reader lens portion, I have to tilt my head back -- and this is after pushing the nose piece as high as I can.  I can manage that tilt for awhile, but eventually my neck gets tired.<br /><br />This would be so easy to fix -- just raise that bifocal line 1-2 millimeters, and the placement would be perfect.  I can get them to work by attaching adhesive nose piece pads that will raise the level enough so that I can read comfortably, but I really shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />As is, as much as I'd love to love these, I can only say ""they're OK."""
3.0,"Very cute but made of thin material , see through in the sun.  Good thing that they have the short inside."
3.0,"The design/shape is good but the XS is crumpled and not tight looking. Item came in a package for a different product (a &#34;sunbib&#34; for the neck/chest). Limited colors for XS. Tan color is dark tan, almost brown. Seems like the material will block uv though."
3.0,Material is a little too thin!!!😔
3.0,"I bought these, needing some masks, come to find out they are very small. Luckily for my, I was able to give them to my 7 year old, and they fit him perfectly.  They look awesome as well, and was well."
3.0,"Nice pennant, but the chain turned color quickly.  Gonna have to hunt for a better one.  Sad that it was a birthday gift and now I'm a little embarrassed."
3.0,"When I opened the package one of the crystals were missing from the necklace, so disappointing! I planned to give it as a gift to my friend's 5 year old this weekend."
3.0,the seams were too long covered belly button
3.0,"I find the style of the bag and material fairly attractive.  However, this three-in-one bag has a design flaw. The zipper on the outer bag is a good two inches shorter than the inside bag, on both side! Other bags I have bought from different sources don't use a zipper there. A magnetic snap or turning clasp works much better. Also, the seam on one side of the bag got turned inside, so the bag doesn't look right. I assume that that's a packaging issue. I probably won't send it back, since it's not a Prime item and I will have to pay shipping, but that's a note to self to stick to Prime."
3.0,The sleeves were too long and the sweatshirt too short. I gave it away. However  for the price it wasn't bad.
3.0,Love the saying. But WAY too big. I made it work....
3.0,To large and need to be altered in the length but good quality
3.0,"I haven’t wore it yet, but it looks nice."
3.0,I did not like the washing instructions
3.0,slips less than some of the other nonslip socks i've tried. it shrunk a bit after a couple of washes though so now it's a bit too small. I'm a size 9 though so it might still fit better for someone with a smaller shoe size
3.0,It didn't quite lay properly in the chest area.  The material was comfortable.  I couldn't wear it because it just didn't look right so I gave it to a friend.
3.0,"I just received my black glasses after waiting a few wks for backorder. The glasses themselves seem to fit fine, they are light and don't sit on my cheeks which I hate, but they were smudged up as if returned  AND I did not receive any of the accessories that are advertised to come with it. No case, cloth or screwdriver to maintain them. I'm alright with the glasses, so I'll keep them rather than the hassle of exchange, but still feel ripped off I didn't receive my entire purchase."
3.0,"They look cute, but they kind of mess with my eyes when looking around. I may have to get use to it."
3.0,"As many other reviews mentioned, these shoes run quite narrow.  I know Merrell's run small as a brand. I also wear stiff custom orthotic inserts so I have to leave room for those too.  I've been able to make this work in the 5 other pairs of Merrell's I own but ordering a half size up from what I wear in Nikes.  Didn't work with these.  I could live with the narrow width since the sides of the shoe have a lot of stretch and you can adjust the bungee laces in many different ways but I cannot get past the fact that my heel slips out with every step.  I tried using thinner liners under my orthotics or no liner at all but the back of the shoe is cut so low I could not stop the slipping.  I'm printing the return label right now.  Sad because these shoes are very stylish in appearance and seem like they'd fit like slippers but fall far short in reality."
3.0,"I saw reviews about how they were too long on some customers, so I purchased a pair as I have long legs, and have difficulty time finding long enough lengths. I wish that had been a couple inches longer, the aren't as long on me as the photo they show (my ideal inseam would be 33&#34;-34&#34;). that said, they fit ok otherwise, the fabric is a bit on the thin side, but not see-thru..."
3.0,Fit comfortably but the grommets holding the metal plate broke and fell of the first time wearing for all three I purchased.
3.0,"(the wife) bought this to replace my actual wedding ring, I didn't want to ruin it, but it immediately turned my finger green. I coated in in clear nail polish after and it seems to be working"
3.0,"bigger than i expected, but cute"
3.0,beautiful but really small
3.0,"I ordered this to go with my Fossil Unisex 44MM Gen 5 Carlyle HR- and yes, it fits and it looks good.<br />My negative is that I didn't read the fine print, and realize that its not a true chain band.<br />It is just that stretchy elastic that comes in bracelet making kits, that is holding the beads and ""metal"" -looking- pcs of the 'chain' together.  I did purchase it thinking it was a true chain band- so I'm a little disappointed with that, but after re-reading the description  I do see that it does say 'elastic' - so just make sure you know that when purchasing.  Price is ok for a plastic and elastic band- and it does look really nice.  I'll have to see how it holds up long term- but I won't expect durability.  I'm a little nervous that it will break at the wrong time and I'll lose the watch itself (the most important part).  So, maybe not something to be worn for daily use.<br />Also note-<br />The rings around each bead are plastic as well- not metal.  The only thing that is metal on this  band are the pins to attach to the watch, the 'rings' that attach the bands to the clasp (I don't even think the clasp is metal)  Not even that dangly chain at the end that adjusts the size... that seems to be plastic as well.  At least, I  couldn't get a magnet to attract to anything but the 3 small jump rings."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress.  The fabric is really pretty, and it is well made.  The problem is the sizing - the way it is cut. For referance,  I am 5'7&#34; tall, a B cup, and about 150 lbs, so typically a size 10. I bought a large.  The waist sits way too high- like a good 2 or 3 inches higher than my natural waist - so the skirt part starts too high on me. The &#34;waist&#34; starts just below my bust and is a little tight on my ribs, but doesn't actually come down to my actual waist before it flares out.  On the other hand, the bodice is way too big, gaping open in fact. It is like someone took a petite dress and just made it wider, without out thought to height and proportion.  I think this dress would look good on someone who is short and very curvy.  If you are maybe 5'5&#34; oo shorter and big busted, this dress would probably look great on you.  For someone tall and long waisted, with average bust, it just looks awkward."
3.0,Ok so the frames are really big which I liked.  The lenses are to tall and sit on my cheeks and move every time that my cheeks move.  The nose piece is not adjustable and never touched my nose.  Sorry to say they are going back.
3.0,I ordered a 2XL because I have thick legs but the pants was definitely too big. I should have ordered the large. I am 5'11 185 pounds athletic built.
3.0,"VERY SMALL, I JUST DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO AD"
3.0,"I really don't know yet this is a present that I'm going to give in June so I'll let you know them, again thanks."
3.0,large is not large enough and it is close to transparent on the thickness side. These are not the t-shirts you are looking for.... move along
3.0,"I love Patty Boutik and own many of her sweaters. I really wanted to love this sweater but it just didn't work for me. I found the color to look drab on me and maybe because I'm very large chested, but I felt this just wasn't as flattering on me as the other sweaters in this line. I think the pattern made my chest look so large I looked a bit disproportional. For reference I'm 34ddd and 125 pounds and 5'4''. I think someone with a smaller chest might really like this sweater more than I did. I will say the sweater was very warm and nice quality!"
3.0,These are a good pair. They look exactly as the picture. My shoe size (flat heels) is normally 7. But the panda sandals tore in about 3 weeks of delicate indoor use on hardfloor. So I do not know if it is quality or the show size but they look incredibly cute and feel really warm.
3.0,Well made and it fits my body perfectly but the length was lacking. Ass was out ..... literally.  5'9..... I gifted it to a short friend.
3.0,"The shirts were great, took too long for shipping"
3.0,"I ordered a GREEN one and got a black and white one. Very nice material, we'll constructed.  Only disappointment is the color"
3.0,I like em and I keep ordering them. But the Stem breaks off easily so I have to keep buying them
3.0,"I bought this to wear with leggings and based on the picture, it looked as though it was longer in length.<br />The quality of the shirt itself is nice but it isn’t as long as the picture and seems to be shorter in the back ie less coverage. (I’m a short person so I would have thought it would have been even longer for me but it fell just below the waist which to me is a normal tshirt, not a tunic.<br />I like the style but since it’s not as long as in the picture, it’s not what I need."
3.0,Product was delivered quickly. Three of the four pairs of glasses needed the lenses popped back in which was a pain because they are very thin.
3.0,I was disappointed in these sun glasses.  They are huge.  I didn't realize how big they are but the sun glasses are oversize.
3.0,not better than pathfinder as mentioned
3.0,"this would be five stars except that the belt slides a bit so it gets loose. otherwise perfect, 3 compartments are great, perfect size (not too big, not too small). great price."
3.0,I love the print on this dress and it fits ok - the top is a bit large
3.0,"the hat is too small, for the labeled size. I have a similar group of hats from 4hats and they fit fine. The xl size should be equivalent to a 59cm<br />euro hat. liked the hat. disappointed that, not even my stretcher will help me with it."
3.0,I would have loved to have used this product but it runs really small. was a true waste of my money cus I cant use it!
3.0,Looks great - feels great - seems quality - the Skeleton back is a bnice touch. I really like the coin bezel - keep good time when  it IS running. I loved it all except one flaw. The automatic  movement is designed for an active user ONLY!  Mine would constantly stop some time during the night even though i usually do not sleep more than 8 hours.  I really like the idea of not having to depend on batteries for power - but in this case  it was unusable for me - probably because i now lead a more sedentary life at my age. The undependability to hold enough energy to go through my average 24 hour day made it unsatisfactory.  If it were NOT for this issue - i would have given it 5 stars. An excellent quality watch - just not right for my current lifestyle. If you lead an  average active life - GO FOR IT. A very cool watch..
3.0,"Cheaply made, but you do have a ton of them so who cares if you lose one! No stud at bottom to keep them from coming out of nose, but easily bendable to leave small bend in nose to stay."
3.0,"When the unit arrived I needed to remove some links.  The first time I used the link remover, it worked ok.  After trying on the watch, I still found the band too large - requiring extra links to be removed.  When using the remover a second time it broke.  Ultimately I went to a watch repair and had them do it.  With all of that said and the band fitting well, it was a good value.  It looks good as well."
3.0,"We ordered these as part of a gift package to an overseas soldier.  They are fun but you cannot really see clearly through them, you see the lines somewhat."
3.0,"fits smaller than normal, it's actually stretchy, not a tshirt like I expected."
3.0,"Some of the parts seem to be cheaply made and not gonna last. The tazer or stun gun seem to be very fragile, when I plugged it in the charge it. The plug in was very unsecured and no way to tell if it was charging or not."
3.0,After one wash it came out with a whole where the stitching had come undone. I love it though. It's very comfortable.
3.0,"It is how it looks in the picture, Just that I realized it is not my style. The tissue is light"
3.0,This sweater looks in the picture like it's tucked into the jeans and looks much longer than it actually is.  It actually only came to my waist providing I did not life my arms and there is no way I could get it tucked into my jeans.
3.0,"They're ok. They are cute and color exact, but I'm having a hard time wearing them as leg warmers as opposed to long socks."
3.0,Dress is thicker than I anticipated. Dress is very beautiful on though. Floor length. Comfortable fit.
3.0,Like the logo but the mask is way to big.
3.0,I love the way the dress fit (might go with a medium next time-top was a little big) BUT zipper was not functional. It would zip all the way up but open towards midway (it was not tight fitting in that area so it wasn’t because of that) really sad zipper didn’t work because I really liked the dress
3.0,"The blouse is thinner than I expected. The body of the blouse fits well, but the sleeves are  much narrower where they connect to the bodice than would be expected of a batwing blouse, making for an uncomfortable fit. It will be an okay blouse for moderate weather, but I don't expect I'll wear it as often as I had planned when I purchased, simply because I don't like sleeves that bind."
3.0,"Ok for the price. Bought Jan 2017 and strap broke Sept 2018. Decent for basic uses: time, alarm, stop watch & light."
3.0,Not s good purchase but it will do for now.
3.0,Ordered the white one with buttons and bows. What came wasn’t as pictured. Zipper was almost impossible to operate. Sent it back.
3.0,"On the cheap side, but adorable. Can’t withstand anything heavy. I got it for beach towels in my trunk. Works perfect for that."
3.0,Nope. Too heavy. Too big. Mainly I didn’t like it because it was too big and the material is way to heavy.
3.0,very streatchy. a little see through
3.0,"It's okay. The material isn't horrible. The size is way too large though. I ordered a medium. I am 130 lbs, 5' 7&#34; and it fits like a dress."
3.0,"Loose, large, and too long. Small is not a small, more like Long medium"
3.0,"These glasses do a decent job of blocking sun glare, EXCEPT that they only cover the top half of my field of vision and there is no way to adjust them to improve that. The lack of adjustability is the big downside, despite the generally good quality of the product."
3.0,"It was Too Big, So I Tried To Return It. I Was Told To Keep It. Now, A Recent Email wants Me to Return it. Do Better🤨"
3.0,Got them for my son. He love them especially the pot leaf ones.
3.0,pretty but took forever to arrive
3.0,The jumper fits nicely but is definitely not denim. It's more like cotton with spandex blend.
3.0,"One of the sliver buttons has broken off.  Have to manually shake watrch for 20 to 30 minutes to obtain continuos running.  But other tha that, it's a great looking watch."
3.0,"Really cute dress, nice material, enough coverage on the bust.  However, there isn't enough material to truly wrap around, so you end up with more of a robe effect, where the two layers barely meet, and when you take a step your entire thigh shows.  If a strong wind blew, it would literally blow this dress open.  I ended up pinning it together to it stays shut."
3.0,pros: nice compact design<br />  plenty of power<br />  attractive price<br /><br />cons: extremely hard to turn off once it is running. push....push...push harder...harder. Could use a new switch design.
3.0,Eye Glass Lanyard
3.0,good service.  did not like them for cycling class.  too much bulk - made them feel uncomfortable
3.0,Tent
3.0,"I would give 5 stars for this beautiful robe, except its falling apart at the hood. Loive the feel of it, but it's way too early for it to be falling apart."
3.0,Leather looks nice however where the strap meets the frame (where pin goes through leather) is a weak point of this strap. Mine only lasted almost a month and a half before it broke at this point.
3.0,It is a beautiful watch but the picture on the band is fading.
3.0,This necklace and bar focal piece was longer than expected.
3.0,I normally wear size s or m shirts so I bought the s/m sleeves. They are much too big. They won't even stay up for 10 seconds before starting to slide down my arms. These are listed in the &#34;women's&#34; category but I suspect it is actually men's sizing.
3.0,Pants have fly with minimal fabric overlap. You probably won’t want to wear these in public — something might just pop out. About a 32-33” inseam and baggy in the knees and calves.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5119fe860d109bffdb75a032e7fb3dd8]] My thighs feel tight and I can’t even button my top :’)) If you have thick thighs, size up-"
3.0,Beautiful dress! Great quality too! I ordered a size large. I usually am a large or 10-12 in dresses. Dress fir insanely big on me especially the shoulder and chest area. Would fall off. Size down
3.0,This wig was ok... a one hit wonder.  He was loosing beads all night. The wig was pretty thin but it did cover his entire head.
3.0,this item runs every small i say it large is a 7-8 not a 10
3.0,"The fabric does look the same as the picture. I odered the blue dress. The fabric is stiff, no stretch what so ever. The sleeves have to stretch either.<br /><br />The center cinched seam looks pretty bad on me. I am 5'8"" and weigh 140 but my bust is 38 inches so I'm top heavy. This style of dress is not a good cut for my body type.<br /><br />I have not worn this dress once. I think if you are more petite it might look good. However, I would not buy again."
3.0,"I love the way these earrings look! I loved them so much that I bought two more pairs to give as gifts. The only reason I'm leaving a three star rating instead of five is that this; when I tried to remove the earrings from my ears, the little bit of pressure on the penny proved too much and it popped off of the stud. Very sad. It looks like they are only attached with epoxy or something not quite suited for metal jewelry. I'll try to fix them, but I'm not sure how to remove them without breaking them."
3.0,"The earrings are designed very well but ubfortunately, they are too big. They are also a bit heavy which isn't a problem."
3.0,I think for the price its worth it.  I was really hoping for a higher quality material.  I will use this set twice this year and then put it away for awhile.
3.0,"looks baby blue in the listing, but what arrived was more turquoise.  great dress, just not what I needed."
3.0,"Very cute but threw them away , they broke when putting them on"
3.0,"Super cute hat but bit small on my head.  Probably best for smaller Gal or Medium size guy..  I'll give to my Niece, in style for younger gals so I know she'll like it."
3.0,"This is really cute but it's a bit snug. I generally wear a medium in everything and I'd say this shirt fits more like a small. I'm 5'-5"" and about 150lbs.<br />The material is really comfortable though, not too thick but not too thin. Just wish I would've bought a large!"
3.0,the lace arms turned my skin a darker color. hope it doesnt keep doing that. bought according to the size chart and it was a little large. hoping it shrinks over time in the dryer
3.0,I really like these.. the only thing is they run really small.. I wear a med. I should have ordered a lg or lx. But the are very cute.
3.0,"Great bag other than a couple of minor details. I love the size. When I first got it I was afraid it was going to be too small, but all of my things fit in it easily. The red color is beautiful and the leather is soft.<br />The things I have an issue with:<br />1. The lining is cheap and it SMELLS TERRIBLE! I've had the bag for a few weeks now and is getting better. Smells kind of like gasoline.<br />2. The tassel charm looks tacky. I thought it was really cute in the picture online and was one of the reasons I chose this bag but up close...NO. I put it on my cat's tree house and she loves it! ;)<br />3. The zippered side pocket is not deep enough for my iPhone plus, which had I known that prior to ordering it would have been a deal breaker.<br />4. The shoulder strap is weird. One side is leather, the other is fabric. What's with that?<br />Overall, I am not sure I would order the bag again but like it enough to keep it."
3.0,"I really like the designs, but the color looked a little too fake though. I couldn't bring myself to wear them all together like I wanted."
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress but was disappointed when I tried it on and found it was about 4"" too long. I liked the color and comfort of it that I hated to send it back so I gave it to my daughter-in-law.<br />  If you're on the tall side, I'd highly recommend this as one of your summer staples."
3.0,"Bag was just poorly packed: it arrived smushed and with a strong odor. I normally don't complain about those things because you can usually get rid of an odor with spray or something, but it also wasn't big enough to hold my laptop and work supplies, which is what I was hoping to use it for. I ended up returning this."
3.0,My weight is primarily between my backside & stomach. I ordered the plus size 12-22. These leggings don't accommodate the stomach area at all. I'm sending these back for a refund.
3.0,"I don’t hate them but I’m not sure if I love them either. I took pics of different views because when I was ordering I wished I had a better idea of size and color of what I was getting. I chose orange because I have a dress with orange flowers and I’m happy that they match it. However, I’m a bit disappointed in the weight, I think they’re a little bit heavy. And you can see in my picture of the pair alone that the earring on the left is perfect in shape, it matches the stock photo, but the earring on the right looks a bit defected, it’s not shaped perfectly like the other."
3.0,I received the item dirty there were a few bits of green cloth on it and it appeared to have been a used and returned item.
3.0,"If it wasn't for the small size, I would give it 5 stars! But the 12-24 description is misleading"
3.0,Fabric is a little thin. I will definitely have to suck in. Haha. The pockets seem weird after you take your hands out. For the money it was a deal. I am 5ft 6.5 inches tall and the dress came right to the floor.
3.0,"I bought this dress to wear to a family reunion and chose this design specifically to accomodate a ribcage tattoo I had recently gotten. The overall impression of the dress is nice. It's flowy and whatnot. But the second time I wore it the piece that ties behind the neck just broke off. The craftsmanship and sewing on this is poor. Nothing a quick hand stitch can't fix, but that's not why you buy clothing."
3.0,"It is a cute suit, but the fit of the bust area is off. When I tightened the top tight enough it bothered my neck. When I left it looser, it did not fit properly in the chest area."
3.0,too see through
3.0,"The charm is a darling addition to my bracelet for a great price. However, I am sad to say that the gold color has already started to fade after only a week. It is still a nice charm for the price, but now you know."
3.0,I considered this rating of 3 stars because.<br /><br />1. I measured my hand to be 8.5 so I ordered a 9 but the thumbs of the glove were 1/3 of an inch longer.<br />2. The remaining 4 fingers were loose.<br />3. The wrist snap closures were too tight.<br />4. I ordered the similar driving gloves from BMW and they were waaaay better.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />1. Excellent quality leather.<br />2. Very classy looking.<br />3. Will stretch over time but won't solve the problem of the thumb being too long or the remaining fingers being too loose width-wise.
3.0,"Per reviews, I ordered up 1 size, when I tried it on it was extremely tight, felt like it was 2-3 sizes too small."
3.0,The finishing wasnt good enough bt nice though.
3.0,"Really pretty really bracelet. Unfortunately, it gets caught on clothing very easily. My UNC charm fell off because of this."
3.0,"Really cute top but the arm holes are TINY. I’m 5’4” 145 pounds. A size medium in just about everything. I got a size large just to be safe and it’s tight on my arms…not so tight that I can’t wear it, but clearly quite tight. I’m a size 6 or 8 in clothes so according to the size chart for this suit I should be a medium. The bottoms are not high waisted and are basically a wide thong. Not at all flattering, but for the price I’m fine with just the top."
3.0,"So excited to get this bag but in the photo it looked more silver.  When it arrived it was tan/taupe (as described) and the accents were gold, not silver as was reflected in the picture.  Still a huge bag and Big Buddha Bags are great.  Just wish that it had been the color I had thought."
3.0,"I got the mask with the bendy thing at the top/ by the nose. This mask is way too big for me! I should have looked at the measurements before ordering! (Note that I usually wear smaller face masks for kids) Thin material. It’s not cotton, it’s more of a sporty and kind of itchy material. The nose bender thing is stiff and not very bendable. Easy to breathe through, probably because it doesn’t fit my face."
3.0,"Hoodie came relatively quick, feels just like you would expect with polyester.<br />I bought a MEDIUM, I am 170 pounds at about 5.9"" tall and this fits more like a SMALL."
3.0,"Fits good however colors dont like anything like pictures, looks very discolored."
3.0,The dress overall is ok hi ver where it may stretch on your body you’re going to lose color saturation. I’m a 42D and a size 16/18 and sadly wherever the stretching goes on my body it does not look as red.<br /><br />It’s a bit frustrating.<br />Maybe if it was a simple black dress.<br />I just don’t think I’ll wear this because of the lack of color and where it changes where it stretches.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
3.0,I purchased these to wear at work because I stand for long periods of time.  I based the size on my shoe size and purchased the medium.  It was not as tight as I had hoped.  I had to return it.
3.0,"Small. The 2x fits like a 1x.  If you can, go a couple of sizes up.  It's good quality and sexy though.  I'm keeping mine.  I have a goal to fit into it by New Year's Eve 2019."
3.0,"The design on this ring is reallly beautiful.  It is also very comfortable.  After wearing it a day or two each week for a few months, a few of the stones fell out.  I liked the design so much, I ordered another one.  I hope to have better luck with the 2nd one.  The price is very good so I don't mind ordering a new one."
3.0,"good quality, very heavy, did not realize there was a cross inlayed, should have looked at detail more carefully, my mistake."
3.0,I'm upset I got mine today they fit well but theres a hole in the seams I ordered them for a trip but they have a hole in the crotch so I cant wear them now :(
3.0,"It's not super slouchy, fits me like a regular sock hat. Smelled funny when I got it."
3.0,"It’s ok, serves a purpose, but the back straps are way too short to actually use it as a backpack. I’m 6’4 and it is just was too small to use as a backpack.<br /><br />Quality is ok, not the best, but not the worst."
3.0,"Still trying to decide if I like this or should return it. I'm 5'6'' and 145lbs, I ordered a medium. The shirt is rather wide and does not look very flattering. It's a very cute too otherwise!"
3.0,"These are super comfortable and fit well. I am 5'7"" and 160lbs. But these are not fleece lined. When I walk around I can feel the air come right through them. Good though if you just want regular leggings for fair weather."
3.0,Smaller and not enough stretch
3.0,For the most part it is cute is dropdead gorgeous but I am a little short. I feel like I didn’t fit in my stomach area it will be better for a taller woman still in my size and I ordered a medium I believe
3.0,"It is an overall nice bag, with plenty of pockets. However, not very well made. The cross body strap hardware failed the very first time I used it. Very disappointed."
3.0,"I wear a 10 and have wide-ish feet.  These felt a full size larger.  I actually checked the label in them a couple times because I couldn't believe they were really 10's.  They're very cute: a little Victorian without getting costume-y.  If they'd fit, I would have kept them."
3.0,"Not exactly what is in the picture, but the wife liked it so we kept it."
3.0,Very comfortable but magnet a little weak and opens unexpectedly. Watch fell off my arm a couple of times
3.0,"Maybe this is my fault for not reading the description completely. But, I did not realize this tie cannot be tied. It comes instead with an elastic band to secure it.It looks like it's tied, unless someone tugs at it and sees it has elastic. This is for me nephew in high school, where kids tug at your ties."
3.0,It's very thin and that's the only reason why it that was given a 3.
3.0,"I'll always go for polarized lenses; the lens is great for driving. After owning a pair for about a year, I've noticed the rubber padding on the arms is starting to unattach itself, and the rubber also gets very soft on hot days when left in the car. Where the arms fold in, they have [slightly] worn away the polarizing film over time. For the price though, and knowing I sometimes lose a pair l, I'd buy these again."
3.0,somewhat cheap looking. I didn't wear it for what I ordered it for.
3.0,I’m 5’9” 150 lbs and I ordered a large. The top is too big.<br /><br />The insert pads have a lot of room to move around which makes it look funny.
3.0,The fabric is too soft and doesn’t look as good as it should
3.0,"I loved the look of these, but they kept falling off and never stayed on well.<br /><br />I returned for another brand."
3.0,"I get this set to use for Christmas Day, I was satisfied for the price I paid."
3.0,"These shorts are cut sort of strangely, with a longer than normal rise, meaning you'll have some extra fabric hanging down between your legs. They also have a built-in panty which is not my favorite thing. They're serviceable enough and true to size, so I'm sure I'll wear them, but they're not going to be my go-to shorts on summer days. This is the pair I'll wear when all my others are in the laundry basket waiting to be washed."
3.0,The beads feel like plastic and I doubt they are real amber.
3.0,Nice and thick but the zipper often gets stuck where the waist is sewn about an inch from the top. (Even when I'm not wearing it.)
3.0,this is ok eyegasses case.
3.0,"Update.  Excellent customer service. The company contacted me and shipped a different model of goggles which work fine, and are very stylish.  Apparently, they have different designs for diffferent nose bridge sizes.  So choose carefully when buying.<br /><br />Goggles are unwearable.  There are four sharp pieces of plastic on the nose bridge that rip into your nose.  I bought five pairs to give to underpriviliged chiildren at our community pool, and I will have to find another product.  These I am throwing in trash because the return period expired."
3.0,"The description listed ""tie"" at the waist so I thought the pants could be tightened on my petite daughter. That is not the case. The tie is purely decorative. She can not wear the pants as the waist is not adjustable and they won't stay up. I find the description misleading."
3.0,Cute shoes but they are incredibly large.  I got them for my 2 year old and they probably won't fit until she is 7.  They are waaayyy off from normal sizing standards.  I am keeping them as I'm sure she'll fit them eventually but just don't expect to use them right away.
3.0,"Only one size. Okay it, wouldn't buy again. Very simple. More for style rather than a necessity of what a belt is for."
3.0,Very bad quality the watch don't resist the water
3.0,"Love it, I wear it to work as much as possible it soft but not too cheap material is cool on a hot day,,,,, enjoy,,,,,"
3.0,The color was not as advertised. Shows a very bright blue but when it arrived it was a very dark blue. Otherwise it was a nice bracelet.
3.0,"Very cute, I ordered a large, when I usually wear a small in US clothing. The back is almost thong style so I won't be wearing it to the beach but it is very cute! I wear a 32 D and the top JUST fits..."
3.0,Very cool looking but it's very large in size
3.0,Cute bag but the side busted on the first wear. Thumbs down
3.0,I bought this and the moon came broken so I had to send it back. When the new one came I realized the diamonds on the star aren't even visible like the one on the moon and the clip is very hard to open when you try to take them off. I give them the benefit of the doubt for being 10 dollars.
3.0,they look cute and perfect. very comfortable once its in place. Getting it in and clicking it closed took 10 min because it was so small.
3.0,"Bought two pairs of this brand, and one was extremely big while this one was too small."
3.0,Was more orange than red with spots that didn’t have crisp edges. It felt almost like you doll clothing material to me than what I wanted - bright side? Probably dries fast
3.0,"I ordered the plus-size XXL after reading the reviews. I am a petite 5'2&#34; hourglass, size Medium or Large with a 36DD chest, 30 inch waist, and 43 inch hip. It is still a little tight on the bust but still works. The colors are a little bit more muted than pictured. I love the sleeves though. This is more of an empire waist if you are C-cup or larger, so that is something to keep in mind since it doesn't state that in the description and it's not reflected in the pictures."
3.0,"Beautiful dress. Fits somewhat small. Had to return, returned weeks ago and still NO REFUND."
3.0,"Soft material, but the picture is a little muted by the black stripes in the shirt. People don’t notice it’s a Fall shirt. Runs really big. I ordered a small for my 12 year old and a large for me. She is able to tie a knot in the side of her shirt. I actually need a small instead of a large."
3.0,I love the shirt the silhouettes are not the exact same color or order but it looks awesome. What did suck was the fact that my shirt began to un-sew at the shoulder after I wore it once or twice. Bummer since I had declared it my favorite shirt.
3.0,Its not good quality and stretches out to big .
3.0,"I liked how lightweight this is, perfect for a hot day to throw over the suit.  But it is not long.  It is about hip length and I am only 5'4"" with a short torso."
3.0,The hat is nice but runs small and had to return it.  My grandson is 2 years old and it was too small.  Would be suitable for a 1 year old.
3.0,Doesn't grip super but seems to stay in place.  There are not a lot of options for wider headbands like this so this was what I settled on.
3.0,Product came jus alil longer to my waste as I'm 5&#34;5..&220 lbs.. But cute and very up to date looking very 2016 ish!
3.0,"These are very warm gloves with a cute decoration at the wrist.  The touch screen fingers work well.  They can be worn for all occasions.  However, mine were too small. I always order M for gloves.  If I were to order again, I would order a large."
3.0,"Love the shirt and the loose flowy fit of the shirt. Make sure to size down one or even 2 sizes. And, the green is NOT green, it's brown. A little disappointed in the color but again, love the shirt."
3.0,Was a little small but still cute and comfy
3.0,It was what it was for a glow hoodie
3.0,"Cute, but smaller than expected"
3.0,"It's beautiful but, it did not come with a bow as shown in the picture ...."
3.0,A lot of extra material...if you going for a fuller/ bloated look. Will return thus item
3.0,"Supposed to be 14k plated but it's not stamped. Looks okay but it has a lot of flaws that give away that it is cheap. For the price it's not too bad, but that's not saying much."
3.0,they get holes in them too easily.  NOt as durable as WigWam (but a lot less money too)
3.0,"Seemed ok was smaller than expected, but still fit"
3.0,"I loved the all the bling, but there was a big gap at the end of the belt where there wasn't any of the jewels and it didn't look right. You would have to buy an extra big belt so that the belt could overlap itself and cover up the empty spot."
3.0,"Like the fit of the neoprene foot.  They need more belt loops.  They won't stay up, I have the standard American dad bod, a gut and no butt.<br /><br />Maybe some suspenders attachment points would be good."
3.0,"My first use: cple of articles of clothing, 1.5 full liter of water.. running through Penn  Station and the shoulder handle snaps & breaks. Thank the good Lord that the shoulder straps themselves kept the bag on my shoulder. Fits a decent amount although I wish it were a little bigger, at least for city living."
3.0,"It's okay. I got an ex large since a review said they run small... But now it's too big. It kind of looks like a scrub with a tie in the front, but that may possibly be because of the size"
3.0,"It's a cute shirt but I never wear it unless it's to sleep in. It fits like a tent. If you are small framed, this is not a flattering shirt."
3.0,"The sweatshirt looks exactly how it does in the image. However, the neck is extremely small. It busted open as soon as I tried the sweatshirt on."
3.0,"I loved the suit in many ways, but it was just too low cut. If I bent over just a little bit, you could see all the way down to my stomach. The padding also was very loose, but could have easily been remedied with thread and needle. Sadly, it had to go back."
3.0,"This fit pretty odd on my. I believe this may be best for people with a certain torso length/shape. It was frumpy on me. The fabric was pretty thin as well, not see through for the burgundy though."
3.0,Was my daughter would see this on her key ring and call me more often…but she don’t lol. It’s a good buy to make you kid laugh
3.0,"It's the right color, but the wing size. It's the right material, but without any lining. So it's OK."
3.0,Button fell off as soon as I opened the package.  Poorer quality than my prior purchases with this company
3.0,"The color, fabric, and overall quality was pretty decent. The style itself was just not me."
3.0,The fabric is a little flimsy but it is a cute design.
3.0,"This shirt is cute, but the sizing is off. I ordered my bigger ""normal"" size in ladies because I knew the sizing could be an issue and it was still too small. The material is soft and stretchy, but not the flattering stretch more like bouncy stretch if that makes sense. I returned this shirt."
3.0,Does not offer as much compression as I expected.
3.0,So I bought a medium after reading reviews and hearing it runs small but I don’t think that at all!!! Medium is waaayyy too large for me and hangs off my shoulders in an 80s kinda way. It’s constantly falling down and it just looks big and frumpy. I gave it away
3.0,They don't come in sizes. They fit snuggly. What will happen after being laundered?
3.0,They're cute. I recommend it if you're looking for white gold on a budget. The hoops are a bit smaller than a quarter. They are hollow and feel easily bendable. You have to be extra careful with them.
3.0,"I had to get the straps altered, but all in all, it is a flattering dress--wish they had this in silver!"
3.0,"I'm not sure if Haix has changed how they make these shoes or went with new materials.  I've been buying this same style shoe every year for the last four years, and this is the first pair that my feet hurt after the initial wearing.  I don't think the vendor will take them back, so I didn't even try, sadly I'm out the money and the shoe definitely isn't the same as previous years."
3.0,I loved the cut of the dress but the material is sort of nylon-ish and very see-through and thin.  It also runs about a size too small.  Definitely order up a size.  I would love this dress if it were cotton!
3.0,This shirt was a bit snug~it was ordered a size larger than normal.
3.0,"The CZ lost the shine in the first week, but it certainly is cheap buy tho"
3.0,"Beautiful fabric, color, design. I really wanted to love this dress . But the sleeves  are too long, I’m 5.2. The chest is very open , looks like a bag  :( Shoulders out of place."
3.0,Was a little bit big. Looks great though.
3.0,Too tight on my leg... Leg must be too big for these
3.0,"I really wanted to like this bag based on the photo and its outward appearance. However, it's a little small for carrying more than a laptop and a few other items.  It also doesn't offer much protection for a laptop. All in all, I think I'll stick with my current messenger bag and eiehter keep this as a backup or use it for something else."
3.0,Thin socks cute design
3.0,It fits pretty goid
3.0,I really love it I barely use it thou! 😊 but u should buy it. I feel like everyone looks at me like I'm crazy lol
3.0,"Very pretty, but if you are average in the chest this will be huge on you there. I'm a size 18 and wear a Christmas cup. I would have needed about a DD to fill this out."
3.0,It's like cardboard? like printed cardboard earrings. I was expecting plastic tbh but I'm not rly complaining. they are definitely cute and festive. only reason im giving 3 stars is because it got lost and arrived pretty late.
3.0,"Love the pockets! However, the bosom triangles are too small to provide any real coverage for curves."
3.0,Every picture of this watch doesn't show how thick it really is.  It looks like a thin bracelet but the actual watch is three times as thick as the watch band.  This makes it top heavy and ruins the look it is trying to go for.
3.0,"La camisa es bonita, pero la calidad en la tela y las costuras no es muy buena"
3.0,"There's a couple of things I dislike about this shirt...it's too flimsy!!! Moreover, the material is of poor quality. I don't recommend people buy this shirt."
3.0,Me parece que la calidad del material no era lo que esperaba por el precio
3.0,"It’s a nice shirt, but the seam on the right side is already.coming apart, about 2 inch hole now in the middle of the seam."
3.0,In person this is even a slouchier fit than the picture.  The facings show.  It is comfy.  I kept it and have used it quite a bit.
3.0,"In the past I have used towels, hankeys, and diapers for this task.  Nothing special here except the color matches the hat.  Personally, after use in a hot climate, I'll keep my bandanna and use other things as this is a one purpose thing.  It's nice, but not special.  I've found things that work better in summer Florida sun.  But it is cool looking so if that's your goal, do it."
3.0,"Not as pictured.  I recently bought a lot of what they call barefoot sandals, and every single company sends you two pieces, one for each foot even though yours is pictured like everyone else’s, I only received one piece. It’s pictured showing one on each foot the same as the other items I’ve bought from your company  but for some reason I only have one of the blue  sandal"
3.0,"I got this shirt in an XL but I normally wear a medium and should have gotten a medium.<br />This shirt is made from cheap material and has loose threads.<br />The whole thing - the packaging, material, sewing - all scream Made In China.<br />This is a shirt I’d only recommend to someone wanting to wear for a season or just a few times a year.<br />I wouldn’t recommend this for someone as a closet staple.<br /><br />**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below."
3.0,"66% of the time it'll work every time<br />On the whole this was an okay purchase. The concept was fun and I wasn't disappointed when I opened the package until I got to the hat. Smashed flat by the square packaging this hat now dwells in Davey Jones' locker known as my children's play clothes box. I do love the layered design with the belt and jacket combo with a laced shirt and the pants that came with. I'm 6'3 and 260 lbs of ex-football player and even on me the shirt was a deep V design almost to my tummy-button. Thank You layered jacket. I am most curious about the ""mask and tube attached to an airbag"". It is in there but I don't know why. There is also one glove and an arm brace I can only assume was intended to be a landing place for a parrot I didnt purchase. I had to mangle the glove to even get it on and the bracer didnt even make it around my fore arm. But the plus side was the jacket and pants being big enough for Andre the Giant and a friend. The belt was almost functional and I tested every fiber of the velcro holding up the handmade sword I attached to it.<br /><br />All in all it was exceedingly average albut not overly expensive. If I could have given it 5.5 stars out if 10 I would have."
3.0,"Love the hoodie! Fits great but after washing the length of the hoodie shrunk so it is shorter in the front, thats the only down fall."
3.0,I love it but I recommend getting a size up it runs small but it's very nice and soft worth the price just get a size up
3.0,"small, thin, not really a large enough scarf to accommodate all the figures and colors...kinda boring in my opinion.<br />perhaps would work as a headband, but I don't really do headbands!!!"
3.0,"If you are looking for an inexpensive tie, for occasional use or for a specific event, this tie is fine.  But it is not a tie you would wear many times, as it is only moderate quality."
3.0,colours are good. But this falls down my daughters shoulder.
3.0,Okay !!
3.0,Everything about this slipper we loved . Except the fact right side slipper didn’t fit . It came off  if my little one is running or climbing onto something
3.0,Came so wrinkled it was hard to even see how the shirt fit
3.0,Item arrived on time and just as described.
3.0,You get what you pay for and I'm not mad about it. I ordered a large thinking the dress would run small {I'm 5'7 and 140lbs}. The length is great but it's kind of baggy. I could return it and get a size smaller but then I'd be afraid that it wouldn't be long enough.
3.0,"the elastic waistband is too small for the way the rest of the skirt is cut. the fabric is good, nice color, they just need to use st chief elastic so it doesn't cut in. it's that really rigid thick elastic"
3.0,"These are very sexy under wear and are totally cute on, although just a tad snug.  I love the lace...seems to be soft and high quality as apposed to underwear or panties one might buy at a large chain store...I would order at least a size or two larger than what you wear so that they are not so snug and you get the full benefit out of them...its a great color black....not off color or faded....so it is easy to match it with a black bra or sexy top.  I did receive these panties at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  I would like to see some more products from this seller keeping in mind to order larger than normal...They really are super cute"
3.0,This was a disappointment.  Its a mask and can take a filter.  The printing is blurry and too big to read all the words.
3.0,Color fades quickly. Great fit though.
3.0,They are OK for what I bought them for; a high school dance but I don't think they would withstand a lot of wear.
3.0,La utilice para mí trabajo y es muy incómoda porque me quedo grande y me tapa los ojos y tengo que estarla acomodando a cada momento
3.0,This is not a great hoodie to wear if you are only going to use it as a winter hoodie. It's best to wear this underneath another jacket
3.0,"I purchased Frogglez for both my son (7) and daughter (4).  They both loved them and found them extremely easy to put on and take off.  They were a perfect fit for both my kids.  I would have given this product five stars at the point of purchase, but five months in they are starting to fray at the straps and let in water.  Maybe I'm expecting too much for the longevity of these goggles.  But as a testament to the product, even with the issues I am having now, I am still considering purchasing this product again to replace the defunct ones."
3.0,"I have small wrists and this did not fit without the bottom strap going underneath the watch, preventing proper function as the back of the watch needs to be on skin."
3.0,I dig the jacket but it is tight thru the shoulders in size XL.  I have another fleece from Helikon that fits more roomy across the shoulder. I don't know if it is just the one that I got or what but they are both XL and they fit very differently.
3.0,This should not be called mastectomy tankini top because it doesn’t have a pocket for the prosthesis. This is a wrong description of the item.
3.0,"It's cool. My second month with it. It is not the right color, though. Mine came with an error. Right next to the Hammer & Sickle, there is a small sploche without any paint."
3.0,No where close to as full as it looks on mannequin.
3.0,"Padded more than expected.  Comfortable but don't seem to stay in place as well as others.  Wire already poking through underarm on one.  A great deal, but not my favorites."
3.0,"I was hoping that the shirt was softer, or had a &#34;broken in&#34; feel. It was very stiff and was tight in the bust and hips"
3.0,The chain itself is a rusty bronze color not rose gold colored or silver. I bought for my wedding and plan to return.
3.0,It shrank after I put in the dryer. The size tends to be on the smaller side.
3.0,Cute. Son likes it. The good part is stiff. The whole shirt is kind of stiff even after many washes. Lots of fabric around the neck with the hood.
3.0,"It is a very nice looking dress, but it is not true to size.  I wear a size 18.  I ordered a 2X, and it was a bit too small, and much too short.  I did not return it, I gave it to a friend.  I would give this a dress 3 stars."
3.0,The pocket was not sewn but it looks great at
3.0,"To fitted around legs!  Great quality, but didn’t fit well."
3.0,Just so everyone knows this ugly Christmas sweater is silky.
3.0,It is really cute but too small about 2 sizes off from measurements.
3.0,"I've always been pleased with their clothing. Their sizing is usually on point, but someone must have switched out their sizing chart. These shorts come in Asian sizes. Meaning a 2xl, (what I wear) is actually a small when it comes to these shorts. I mean, I'm fat, but I'm not THAT fat!"
3.0,"Big, shapeless, tent of a shirt... Makes you look bigger than you are, not as long as I had hoped..."
3.0,"The description was correct, however the band on the bicep part was too large. I bought these to cover my sleeves at work. The part that was covered masked the tattoo; but I did have to keep pulling the band up repeatedly throughout the day."
3.0,If you’re long waisted this suit is very difficult to get on
3.0,"Honestly, this thing fits my Gunpla PERFECTLY! It fits the hands better than most of the weapons included with their original kits. That said, it's all one, dark grey color, even though it's advertised as having at least 3 colors. Also, it's a pain to cut out, as the bits stick with each part and are hard af to scrape off or remove without leaving anything behind.<br /><br />All in all, a good one to get if you're building a custom, but just know what you're in for."
3.0,Not what I expected.  Wrinkles very easily.  Does not iron very well.  I was expecting that the spandex would help keep it wrinkle free. Sleeves are too long.  Otherwise I like the fit.
3.0,"I am so disappointed, couldn't wait to get these. They must run VERY Small. Put them up to her size 6, at least a 1/2 inch off. They look like maybe a size 5. I am bummed.."
3.0,lace at bottom feels like cotton lace which is different from the silky feeling lace at the top.  Top fits tight.
3.0,"The dress was nice, really not as expected. It is more of a chiffon/silky material. And the blue is really dark blue. Would had been nicer if of a cotton based material and if the blue resembled more of denim blue. I returned it."
3.0,A nice wooden necklace for my African attire but I wanted all black necklace. This necklace was mixed with gray and black
3.0,"This face mask was very tight on me. I do not really know why. I dont have a huge head. It did feel sleek. I liked that about it. It was breathable but I prefer something loose fitting. It is much easier to handle, by simply putting it around your neck, up and down."
3.0,This skirt is way too cute.  I do agree it is thick but I wanted for a wedding and it seems like a great choice. I went by the measurements given and it was way too big for me. I will be returning this and considering reordering 2 sizes smaller. I would say go 1 size up. I went by the reviews and orders 3 sizes up (didn't go too well).
3.0,nice but front way too big.
3.0,Very pretty. The choker needs a little more length though
3.0,Wish they were a little longer.
3.0,Was made with the clear stretchy elastic for bead. Did take much to break
3.0,"Arrived scratched.  I had to buff it out, and there is still a slight mark on it."
3.0,The coat was damaged when received. Part of the inseam was not sewn together at all. Part of snap missing from last button. See photos attached. So that’s unusable.  Otherwise I love it. Keeps me warm and is lightweight and easy to wear.
3.0,"The dress is more like a tall shirt I have to wear it with a leggings,I am 5,7 and I order xl"
3.0,Picture is a better quality. The cardigan is very thin and poor quality
3.0,I would not call it a dress. More like a shpeless xl pj's ;) but the material is soft and nice. Therefore - 3 stars.
3.0,"I just want to find a hot pink dress, why is this so hard ?! 😟 This dress fit me good in the body but the arms were extremely tight and the dress was pretty short. The cut out design makes it even shorter because you lose that ""coverage"". I'm 5'3 with an average torso and just average legs for reference."
3.0,"These are cute, but I won't be ordering from this seller again. They arrived with one post bent, most likely due to cheap packaging (a small Ziploc-type baggie inside a little drawstring pouch). I was able to straighten the post, but I'm afraid it might break off at the setting when I wear them."
3.0,"Not as big as I thought, and it looks a little cheaply made. For the price though, not bad."
3.0,"ive been a 00 for 10 years and when i got these they seemed like i was sizing up. unfinished, you can feel them scrape around because they are not smooth. they look good tho lol"
3.0,"I bought this for my son.  He has a fairly large head, but this beanie barely even fit my grandson...it is nice looking but VERY small!"
3.0,"I really liked the outside!  The quality was nice and the size was perfect.  However, I returned the bag because of the lining.  The lining was not secured down in any way so that when you went in and out of the bag, the lining would pull out."
3.0,"At first we thought they sent an extra large or large instead of medium. But its marked as medium. This is not your typical sweater, its super oversized. At just over $30 for this, this is also an oversized price. Does not look like the picture at all aside from maybe the color? Aside from the super oversizing, the sweater is well made and decent for a waffle-like sweater. I still chose to give 3 stars as I will try to find a way to wear this but I am not sure yet. Unfortunately I cannot recommend unless you want to try ordering a size or two down."
3.0,"I like wearing over-sized sweaters even though I'm a size Medium. This XL went down to my knees. It's ok to wear at home still, and comfortable. However, I was expecting it to be much softer and feel better from the picture. The fabric was a bit uncomfortable and wasn't soft like a teddy bear. Needless to say, it really does look like a big potato sack bag as a dress. It's too bad that the the material wasn't more Sherpa like and didn't have any cuteness on the hood like bear ears."
3.0,"Thinner than expected and difficult to put on but works, should have a hook on both ends."
3.0,"I love them, but they are small which is obviously expected so it's hard to work with."
3.0,Kinda too big in the hip line and small in the waste
3.0,Fabric pattern slants toward a manly design. Color isn’t very attractive either. Value was quite reasonable.
3.0,Top is really cute. Bottoms are cute very small. I will not be wearing the bottoms at all.
3.0,"The pendant is very attractive and holds the tracker securely. Since I’ve already lost one tracker (in a magnetic clip attached to my pant leg), I’ll need to be careful opening this to recharge the tracker and closing it tightly after replacing the tracker. The chain, unfortunately, as others have mentioned, is VERY light and twists and tangles so  much that I’m going to have to get a better chain. I reported this to the seller who offered to send me a new chain, but why would I want a new one that also tangles?? So 5 stars for the pendant but 1 star for the chain equals my 3-star review."
3.0,You get what you pay for but for how cheap they were I guess these are better than nothing
3.0,I got this for a coworker when we were were wearing animal print for a day at work.
3.0,These seem to be quite a bit smaller than other safety glasses of the same style. These didn't fit when wearing small frame regular glasses underneath.
3.0,The pink is actually a lot lighter than the picture shows. I was wanting a darker color but over all im happy with it and most of all my daughter loves it.
3.0,I like being able to change the snaps depending on the color of my outfit (I bought extra snaps that I like better than those that are included). Chain seems cheaply made but I will keep it and try it out for the price.
3.0,Only came with one lacing string.  No easy way to request a second sting or contact seller without requesting a return/refund. Fit is great! Just doesn't have the second string.
3.0,"The material on the wallet is wierd but cool. It has been used to replace my hubby's old one. I like it for the most part. There is plenty of space and pockets for cards. The only thing I think would add value to this product is a sleeve for pictures, if you're into have them inside your wallet."
3.0,Not super impressed with this.  Was going to give it as a gift to my niece but it seemed kind of cheap and tacky.  Will hold onto it and give it to my daughter eventually and see if she likes it.
3.0,"I really miss the previous cotton type fabric. It draped so much better on the body and made the booty look great!  I own 6 shirts of the previous. I hate this one. This new fabric doesn’t drape well at all, is shorter, and makes you look wide.<br />Please go back to previous fabric!"
3.0,The aren't as pictured
3.0,Not a bad cheap wig. Looks better after you trim up the bangs and etc
3.0,I order a love heart pendant with julys birthstone and received a love heart pendant with Februarys birthstone.
3.0,I thought I was going to love this shirt. The material is scratchy and the sleeve cuff holder JINGLES if you don't have the sleeves cuffed up. It's a disappointment but hey - the perils of shopping online. . .
3.0,thinner than expected. A little clingy
3.0,This product seems to run about 2 sizes smaller.  I am a fan of Spence brand and never had a problem with my other selections so this one may have been marked wrong.
3.0,Wish there was a better color selection
3.0,"Well I'm 6'5"" tall and ordered the 3xl. Ad stated that they run on size. I wanted extra room for a knee replacement brace.<br />Even without the brace on, these Chinese made pants are short and only about 1xl in U.S. size.  So be cautious about them. I will be returning the 2 pair as they are too small."
3.0,Too small around the upper arm
3.0,I thought there were decent looking online but now that I see them I wont be wearing in public...lol<br />Only to drive...<br />Sun shades seem pretty good for the light. Havent tried the others yet
3.0,"It's just okay. It's as described, but the 'fabric' feels almost like foam; there isn't a nice drape to it. I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"Ran a little small, weird material"
3.0,I purchased these for my grandkids for basketball and they loved them!
3.0,"Very cute, but way too small for the price. Will be sending back."
3.0,"The fig is not like model's they are not tapered like the model's. I usually wear a 3X and ordered a 3X. They fit but are larger from the knee down, which looks odd. I had to take them for alterations"
3.0,The quartz was ok but the chain necklace sent to me was not the one shown in the pictures.
3.0,"Disappointed in this product. I like the color, but the shape makes you look wider than what you really are. I think the pockets gives that illusion. It’s not that flattering and I am sending back."
3.0,I guess because I have a lotta junk in the trunk the dress is very very short on me. I'm not happy because the event is tomorrow.
3.0,"Excellent grip when dry. I use them to walk down to my waterfall. If I step into therm while my feet are wet, they become unusable walking back up my hill. It's like I have lotion on the bottom of my feet, and I slip and slide all over the place until I just take them off.<br /><br />5 Stars when dry<br />0 Stars when wet"
3.0,This holds a lot of drinks. Great for parents going to their kids sporting events.
3.0,Product ok but son only wanted one to practice with.  I would not get this for actual use.  The package cardboard marked the tie and would need dry cleaning out of the box.  I have no idea if the marking will come out but have to assume they would.  But it fit the purpose of son practicing tying a bow.
3.0,"I'm a bit torn on these because the pants have some amazing features that I love but also some issues.<br /><br />What I love: The softness and stretchiness of the fabric is hands down amazing. For anyone who hates their waistband digging in at work or the hassle of unbuttoning and unzipping a million things just to go the bathroom, they are a game-changer - honestly it felt like wearing yoga pants to work. I also think the zipping feature for the legs is a super cool idea in theory. It's definitely nice to be able to switch depending on what shoes I'm wearing.<br /><br />What could be better: Overall, the construction on these was pretty poor. Threads hanging out everywhere and a seam started unraveling during the first day of wear. Also, when the legs are zipped down they look pretty good, but when you open them up the zippered parts are pretty obvious and to me that made them feel really unprofessional. I also found the pockets to stick out quite a bit and I had to shove them back in frequently.<br /><br />Overall I think these are a great pant concept and if they were higher quality and addressed some of the issues I mentioned in future iterations I'd be interested in purchasing them again. Otherwise, right now I think they're more of a novelty than really useful as professional wear."
3.0,I was disappointed that the gloves didn't let out my moisture. I used the gloves and got water inside. Days later there was still moisture in the glove. I also used the gloves today on a 4 wheeler driving kids on a sled for an hour or two and my hands were freezing. I wasn't sure if that was because of the prior moisture or if the glove just didn't do well. The temperature was around 15-18 F.
3.0,I'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and the medium fits perfect! The leggings are good quality for the price and we'll made. I'm giving three stars because they have a horrible fishy smell when you open the package. I'm gonna try to air them out because I don't want to have to return them.
3.0,I Love Peacocks And The Feather Is Beautiful...I Like It But Thought It Would Be A Little Better Quality. I Would Not Purchase Again.
3.0,They are cute but not as shinny as shown. Now like a nickle color.
3.0,Adequate but not much support.  Good for sleeping but wouldn’t recommend for larger cup sizes
3.0,"I bought this for my wife because it looks very pretty. She said it’s a little clingy so she won’t wear it because it shows to many curves, LOL  I think there should be photos of large women wearing large  so I guy can get the proper visual !  Deceptive  when you have a sexy woman in a photo !"
3.0,"Malita calidad , doy 3 porque no estaba tan caro"
3.0,Pretty but too small . Need to return for refund. N d a return label.
3.0,The material was awful. Not a sweater at all. Very clingy.
3.0,"I’m 5’6”, 188lbs got for the size 16. It runs large because both the top and bottom were a good bit loose on me when normally 14/16 fits me well. It gave the appearance of a diaper on the bottom which isn’t the best look."
3.0,"I am probably going to exchange this for a smaller size as its a bit too big for me. I'm 5'8, wear a size 38 DD and typically a US size 16. The length came to my knees with the petticoat underneath it. I'll see if a smaller size fit better for me in the chest area than the XXL that I ordered."
3.0,Too much give in material
3.0,I’ve ordered this brand previously and loved the comfort and fit. This one was much smaller!  I’m disappointed and would send back if I hadn’t assume it was also the right size and washed it.
3.0,Great dress except if you have a belly it accentuates it as the black part ends at the top of belly.
3.0,"Color and material is gorgeous. Weird looking around waist as skirt consists of tulle strips tied around a rope, that the sash isn't able to cover. Ok for dress up but wish I hadn't spent this much on a dress that looks too awkward for a feative occasion!"
3.0,The product came a lot earlier than expected would not recommend you are expecting slow rising squishes.
3.0,I bought 4 of these and 1 was not locking. I'm keeping for myself I can fix it.
3.0,The size is an issue.  I originally ordered an extra large and that was way too big.  I exchanged it for a large and that is a bit too small.
3.0,"These were smaller than expected, but the pearls and embellishments were lovely."
3.0,"These are beautiful. But they were a little too big. They kept slipping off my toes. I bought them for a show I was performing in, but I couldn't wear them for it because of that reason 😔"
3.0,the material was not what i expected but the fit was perfect.
3.0,Fit everywhere except my arms- there it was too small.
3.0,"you get what you pay for.. the material is cheap, and somehow, the picture shows that it's a dress, but it isn't, it's really shorter than pictured (I'm 174 cm tall, 55kg weight)"
3.0,I really like this a lot and was sad and yet happy it was too big. As you can see on the top it did not tighten and lift my breasts as it should. I went based on the measurements stated and ordered a 6x and it was too big. I am able to return for a refund but will get a 5x possibly a 4x.
3.0,The shoes are adorable but some how within the first week my daughter found a way to put a hole in the heel part (on the inside of the shoe) and pulled the thread so that the sole of the shoe is no longer attached. I will have to buy more slippers.
3.0,"ordered medium base on the size chart and review, but was way too big. Returned and reordered small, but still a little big and too long. But I like the design."
3.0,"I really like them at first, but after repeated use they became very lopsided on my face and now I can't get them on without looking silly."
3.0,"I bought this in red, but  actually it's more of a pink watermelon color.  not a bad dress for the price, just really wanted a true red.  may return it and if I do, I will review that process then.  The material is nice and thick, stretchy and the dress fits perfect.  Looks like a wrap dress but isn't. I'm 5'6&#34;, 140 pounds, and a 36 DD.  The Medium fits perfect and covers the girls. Flattering style,  Length is to the floor, and long enough to wear with a heel."
3.0,Like I said in my heading....eh! Meaning it's just okay...I prefer the flat cable chain that I bought from them. It has a much better look and finish.
3.0,"The design of the elephant on this ring is very nice.  The elephant is elevated and in silver while the background he is on is red.  The entire design is trimmed in decorative silver.  The problem with this ring is the design of the band.  It is an adjustable band which is supposed to be sized by squeezing the band tighter, but there really isn't a good way to do this.  When squeezed, the band no longer remains circular but becomes a weird oblong shape that is no longer comfortable on the finger.  If this ring came in various sizes it would be much more functional and usable."
3.0,"It sits weird on my arm and my arm is normal size. For the price though, it was no love lost. If you have a smaller size wrist, the bracelet wouldn't work."
3.0,It's a cute dress - red/style 3 - but I had to send it back. It was way too small in the shoulders and bust. I tried a medium as the measurements should have worked. May try a large.
3.0,Filled the bottle. Was fine then the Bottle cap broke first day and it was leaking out everywhere. I need to find a new bottle that will fit.
3.0,"Not heavy duty cord wise which is the most important part, but the clip part is good metal build. If i could return it i would but id have to pay return shipping which is basically the price of the item so im dealing with it"
3.0,"These are made to seem like you could lounge/sleep in them, but the material is that rough, cheap, plasticky fast-fashion material. There is no way I would ever be able to comfortably sleep or lounge around in anything made out of this material. They are true to size, and I like the sheerness.  Nice concept, poor execution."
3.0,"The pad chafes along the inner thigh at the groin because it is too large for me.  Otherwise, these are comfortable shorts for cycling.  I am 5'9"", 155lb."
3.0,"I'm usually wearing an xl in women's clothing and I'm swimming in it. Or at least my chest is.  Hemmed it up a bit.<br />Now that it fits, it's gone through the wash a couple of times and the fabric is still stiff."
3.0,"Dress seemed well made; however, the lining did not go to the floor as pictured, so part of it was see through and did not look good. Unfortunately returned. Maybe mine was just defective?"
3.0,"Cheap quality,rusted from the first three days of wearing it don't waist your money on it i regret this sale lots of better items on Amazon for the same price with much better quality of this one."
3.0,The dress itself is gorgeous.....I would order a bigger size than you are.....and the zipper is not the best qualitly
3.0,The clip was scuffed.
3.0,Fast shipping however material isn’t the best
3.0,"I thought the blouse would be white with flower designs on top, but it's actually a pastel green color. Not soft."
3.0,I wish the slip underneath was closer to the same length as the dress.  It would look a lot better and more put together. It’s way to short and doesn’t look right.
3.0,"No stretch in the waist.<br />If you’ve got any curves, definitely size up by two sizes.<br />If they don’t have your two sizes up then girl don’t waste your time. Lol I still tried, and I wasted my time and feelings."
3.0,"I would love to love this shirt but I cannot. Well constructed but way too small and tight. I followed the size chart but when the item arrived, the label does not say what the size is, and a label on the bag says 3XL. However when I put it one the short sleeves barely passed my shoulders and I felt like I had a girdle on."
3.0,I have a few pendants that I needed a chain for and this one worked. I probably could have bought one at Target or Kohl’s for the same price and maybe better quality but all in all I was going ok with the purchase.
3.0,They are a nice quality but definitely smaller than my normal 2g size and by no means are they the true to listed size. Order up a gauge size if you want them to fit
3.0,To snug on my toes.  Plus not crazy how my toes feel.  Quality was just ok.
3.0,"This is a lovely dress, but the fit on the bottom is not what I expected based on the pictures of the model. On my body, this dress style is not as A-line as the model photos. It is more of a straight fit, there is not much flaring/floating away from the body in the skirt which is not flattering for me. I'm disappointed because it looked so good on so many of the customer review pictures! Will have to return but I wanted to love it :( good quality dress and cute print though"
3.0,Not the best. Not the worst. A little big for me. I am a medium sized 32 A. I already have little clevage. I am bottom heavy in the breast area. Hope this helps.
3.0,"I listened to other women who order the dress and bought the L, wish I had the XL. I am a US 4-6 and wear 34C. I am 5’6. I was able to ge the dress on me but it’s snug and the top will show side boob. Too bad I didn’t know I should have ordered two sizes bigger. Usually the L fits like a M not this time. I felt it’s more on the snug side."
3.0,Masks are too big
3.0,"Love the charm, but the chain left a green ring around the neck."
3.0,These are nice gloves at a good price. The reason I gave them 3 stars is that they stained my hands bright beet pink when I used them in the yard for a full day pulling up ivy. They did it again when I got them wet though I only used them for only a few minutes. My spouse has the brown gloves and the didn't stain his hands at all.
3.0,"Shorter than expected, but I really like it."
3.0,These bras are nice enough. They are pretty and are a good price for three but they have a few drawbacks. They don't seem to stay in place and bunch up some between the ribs and the bottom of the breasts. This causes them to feel like they are pinching a bit and make you want to adjust yourself a lot. Granted some issues could be body shape and might fit one more than another more comfortably.<br />All in all these are very reasonably priced and will do what they are meant to but you do sacrifice a bit of comfort.
3.0,"Fits nice...but my teen girls said I look like a bee (5'7, 135) so its still hanging in the new clothes section of my closet."
3.0,"I'm 5'2 and about 175lbs. I usually wear a size 12-14. This dress has a nice print and decent fabric. (I ordered in a size xl) When I tried it on, flat footed, its expected to be a bit long. It will be perfect with wedges, though. My problem is the belt loop on the left side is where its supposed to be but the right side is stitched in the armpit! 😂"
3.0,"The bracelets are cute. However, they are too big. My wrist is kinda small, but even on the tightest link, the bracelet was still too big."
3.0,"It is a basic and cute looking piece, but I can tell that it is cheaply made. I think that for the price it is being sold for it is a waste. I would say shop around and spend the money on something that looks like the price it is being offered for. This was clearly spraypainted plastic."
3.0,Has lots of linty stringy fluff and it gets everywhere.
3.0,Cute while they lasted
3.0,First of all the stickers was meh there were very few sticker's of different characters and second the keychains feel weird the the only good thing was the amazon prime package :)
3.0,"Ordered khaki, received black."
3.0,"Beautiful design, but if you're getting it in &#34;burgundy&#34;, it's not really burgundy. It's more like a bright Christmas red that sometimes looks like fuschia in certain lightings. The material is also thinner than you might expect, but that wasn't really a problem for me. It also ran on the small side. Shipping was excellent, arrived before estimated date."
3.0,Super cute! I thought was pricey but was a gift! Onsies are ridiculously priced.
3.0,Mine have been tarnishing
3.0,Comfy and stay up pretty well for being high-waisted. They do not pass the squat test though.
3.0,I got 1sz up and it was still tight
3.0,"These sleeves are cheap, but they run tighter than I anticipated based on the sizing guide. If you are on the edge of sizes go for the next size up."
3.0,"I ordered this in a XL which is TTS for me. It took almost a month to arrive because it does ship from China. The neckline is not off the shoulder like it shows in the picture. I will say it's a better quality than expected though. Soft, thicker material but not too thick. I got the tan and the color looks just like the picture. I just wish it was off the shoulder like it showed."
3.0,TOO BIG.
3.0,Much too large for a toddler.
3.0,This is a gorgeous shirt but it is cut very generously. I ordered an XL and based on the cut I should have ordered a medium. I am unfortunately returning.
3.0,"Even though it won't survive a lot of machine washing, it doe protects your identity and gives you excellent visibility.  The seller's service was prompt and efficient and I will definitely purchase from them in the future."
3.0,"Material was soft and comfortable, but the leg length was too short."
3.0,These are good quality as are all of the Isotoners i have ever purchased.  The one downfall of these is that I thought they were the fully convertible gloves which also includes the convertible thumb.
3.0,Holds uniform good. Clips are a little bulky though.
3.0,Not the best it’s pretty small and the wings and horns are falling off I need to stitch them on
3.0,It is nice but too big for my prescription. Returned.
3.0,"I really like the bag it’s a nice material and I like the safety factor but I would like it more if I got the rest of what was supposed to come with it. I got the main bag and that’s it, I was missing the pompom and extra strap"
3.0,The hat felt a little small and the sound quality isn't amazing but it's definitely gets the job done. Great gift idea for kids or teenagers.
3.0,I looked for UV protection shirt awhile. In description it says about protection but is is not correct. Sunlight easily goes through T-short.
3.0,The color wears out after a few times.
3.0,Beautiful print. Will keep you dry.
3.0,"I like the earrings overall, the diameter is a little larger than I expected but it’s not too big. I like the chunky look. They don’t look like silver or white gold, they look like chrome or shiny stainless steel to me. As others mentioned, they are hollow but I could see that in the product images so I expected that. Also the post bent terribly on one the first time I put it in. Because of this, I’m not sure how long they’ll last before the posts break off."
3.0,The ends of the metal connectors pop out very easily. I have to reattach them quite a bit. Pops out fast and sturdy. Easy to hold. Pretty visually.
3.0,Haven't had it very long and the card slats st the bottom have already ripped
3.0,Sizes are a little off I bought a medium and it was huge I bought the small and it’s almost tight so I don’t know what to tell you
3.0,Very cute boots but after about the 4th time wearing them they started getting holes in the seams and water started leaking through. I wish they were a bit more durable.
3.0,"It’s nice but too expensive for the quality, I kept them for I like the look I created with them but would have payed half the price and then I would have thought it was a fare transaction."
3.0,"I got what I expected except the clasp breaks really easy.  After fixing it multiple times, I ended up buying something else to replace it."
3.0,"Feels great. Fits great.  I’m never cold in it. My only complaint is that the hood is not adjustable, so it’s either blinding me or too far back. There are no strings to tighten it."
3.0,Really cute shirt but the material is rough!
3.0,Loved them so cute but my 2 year old got them dirty and I wiped.with towel all glitter was removed so were cute for one day
3.0,"If what you are looking for is a SHINY WHITE wedding band then that is what you are getting. It’s extremely shiny. The white KIND OF looks pinkish. The green is like a weird slime green color. The ring is VERY light weight. I returned mine because of the pinkish Hugh it has and it was far to shiny for my liking. BUT it is a very nice ring. Wouldn’t say I hated it, just wasn’t my taste."
3.0,"“These are not the floppy hats you were looking for.” Have you ever seen those floppy hats that flop just rite, this is not that hat; although people seem to love them on me, but I do have consistently adjust the hat so it stay right. This hat stays more in its own position, you have to adjust it.. it has a nice lining inside, but this is not the floppy hat I was looking for."
3.0,"The quality of the product is great, however, if what I received was the ‘small’ that I ordered, I’d love to know how ‘large’ the large size is. Small is perfect for my adult sized face with plenty or room for mouth movement. I was hoping small would be closer to a child size."
3.0,"Pros: adorable, has cute little button in front to connect &#34;scarf&#34; portion<br />Cons: would be closer to the actual character if the ears were not floppy and were vertical, smells very strongly of chemicals"
3.0,Everyone acted like this was so big. I would say no more than a large. Polyester type material and the colors are beautiful but too small for me. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"One pretty sharp edge on one of the petals. Keeps catching on things. (shirts, blouses, hosiery, dish towel,etc.) I don't think I should have to take it on and off constantly. Didn't want to pay to return it but sure wish I had another one because I like the ring!"
3.0,"Perfect dress for our bachelorette party outing. Dress was actually really comfortable. Two layers, the one underneath goes to about the knee. Fit well."
3.0,I want more please get them back in stock  XS.  These are perfect. Get them back in stock. Or I’ll have to start my own business and make them myself
3.0,"It looks better in the photo, the size is perfect but the finished on the blouse are not as expetet, and the material of the fabric is thicker than expected too."
3.0,"These earrings are beautiful.  Very well made. However,  I was disappointed since I only received one earring in my order. The package arrived looking very beat up and the jewelry box was crushed. The return date has passed. it's a shame."
3.0,I had high hopes but I’ve been let down. It’s hot. I have been trying to find some decent t-shirts and this is not going to be the one.
3.0,"It's quite a tight fit and not heavy duty enough to be a tight lace corset, but the construction as it is is very nice and I love the satiny material."
3.0,"The top was super cute and from the front it looks super cute!<br />I am 5,2 140 pounds and I got a XS and it fit perfectly.<br />The only issue I have is the leggings the hurt scrunch does not really do anything, and it’s definitely not cellulite friendly. I can only speak for the YELLOW! So I bit the darker the color the less noticeable the cellulite, but than again the colors are all light."
3.0,This product isn’t for women with large breast . Only perky smaller breast . Can’t wear or return :/
3.0,Cute shirt boyfriend loves it. Jut wish the medium fit like it should
3.0,It's super long and gets caught on everything but it's a cute necklace
3.0,"Some of the eggs were smashed so we could not insert the stakes. Also, each egg needs two stakes to avoid them spinning around."
3.0,I like this dress a lot !<br />The material is super comfortable- it does have a zipper in the side but the zipper is poorly made- I unzipped t initially to try it on - and couldn't get it zipped when I had it on.<br /><br />I had to take it off and fight the zipper to get it up and hope it didn't snag or bust in the process.<br /><br />Thankfully I am able to get the dress on without it being unzipped but the fitted part was a little hard to get over the breast area.<br /><br />With that being said- the dress is pretty true to size- I ordered a small and I'm 5'4&#34; and 145 pounds- 34C bust.<br /><br />The pockets do bulge a little bit - I ordered a different color way in a medium and sizing up didn't seem to help the pocket bulge despite the dress being very loose.<br /><br />Overall it's comfortable and something I can throw on for church or to run some errands in and still look cute! Not something I would wear to a wedding or for professional photos ect due to the pocket bulge .
3.0,These earnings  are not good quality. I return them they are overpriced
3.0,"The dress was great quality and looked just like the photo, but the embellishment seemed immature and not for an adult woman."
3.0,Cute for costume purposes. Not the greatest of quality.
3.0,It's pretty but its so hard to put on even with the middle part being removable
3.0,It nice for a kid under 10years old
3.0,Easy to break
3.0,Ended up sending it back. Was suppose to be a Adult Large. Looked nice but i didn't need it in a youth size.
3.0,"I usually by large or 34 easy stretch comfort, these shorts are no where near a large. More like a medium"
3.0,"The picture is ok. The material feels pretty cheap, and it doesn’t stay up at all!"
3.0,The pads that come with these bras are like cups they are awkward and small.<br />They move around.
3.0,"Doesn't have a spot where the heel goes. Just a straight cut. I got them to wear in dark lighting/with boots and they work for that. I wouldn't where them I someone was going to see your heels/ankles, though."
3.0,Case protects the watch well while I am working but it is not waterproof.  It definitely is protective and I have avoided scratches and dings.  For the money it is okay but I am not likely to buy another one like it when I wear this one out.
3.0,"These glasses do fit over my glasses. They of course are big, as expected. They unfortunately broke the second time I wore them, not the best made product."
3.0,Might have to return after granddaughter tried it on
3.0,"I have two pairs of these shoes for my girls. They love the style. However, the rhinestones don't hold up well. If you need an affordable cute shoe, these work pretty well. If your kids wear them frequently, they won't last long."
3.0,These are cute. But I had them for the about 2 weeks before the letter fell of the keychain. I bought another one (from a different vendor) and same issue. So I guess the hardware to hold the letter isn’t that strong.
3.0,Did not fit or was not cut the same as photo. Misleading
3.0,Can't get bubbles out without moving the lenses and starting all over. Because when you press down they slide
3.0,"The description says it is antique gold but it is definitely silver. Otherwise very pretty, it is a longer length post which tends to fit my piercing better than shorter ones. Overall, good quality, nothing outstanding though. I have bought jewelry of nicer quality from this same brand. Was really hoping it would be the antique gold like described."
3.0,I would give higher reviews if the closure was more secure and the strap adjustments didn't slip.<br />You're getting lots of room in this bag and a bonus shoe bag great for a wet bathing suit.  I purchased this for my little one's summer camp and I'm able to pack it nicely.  I just wish the closure was better and the strap adjustments stayed put.
3.0,It’s okay but doesn’t look much like the dress on the model. The fabric is synthetic and a bit cheap looking
3.0,I ordered the green but got these. For the price I’m debating if it’s worth the hassle to return. Delivery was behind and not sure if the replacement will arrive on time.
3.0,I wish the sleeves were a tad longer and that it had pockets that would be nice... but its not a horrible dress for just Halloween time!
3.0,ncie
3.0,"Darts are not even on each side in the front of the dress.  One side is higher.  A big no, no, in the sewing world.  Need to be more careful."
3.0,"Shirt collar does not fit correctly. Not a V neck size. Too small, too tight."
3.0,Fabric was not what I expected I though they were all cotton really really long in the back
3.0,"Softer than Russian toilet paper but not as soft as cotton. They get the job done and if one gets stained beyond use I am not going to lose sleep about throwing one away.<br /><br />After washing, they are much softer than straight out of the box.<br /><br />Excellent for nose-blows. Poor for cleaning glasses.<br /><br />Not the best I have used, but they are, after all, just cheap hankies."
3.0,did not like flannel .somewhat course and collar not so much liked
3.0,"I was drawn to this by the price, the lovely color and the promise that it was made of bamboo.<br /><br />My first purchase was a large.  I have never known anyone with a face that big.  It had to be returned.<br /><br />My second purchase was a medium.  While it was a better fit, the cut was not as comfortable as I was hoping.  The material was also not as breathable as I expected.  That one had to be returned as well.<br /><br />Despite everything this mask has going for it, I doubt that I would purchase it again.  However, I would recommend that other people give it a try.  I have a feeling that this is one of those products that will work well for some people even though it is not so great for others."
3.0,"It is definitely thinner than expected, not sure how long it would last …"
3.0,"I love the style and quality of this necklace! The pearls feel heavy and are made from good quality material. However, because of this, the pearl at the center clasp does not hang in the middle because the pearls are so heavy that it shifts the orientation. It is still very wearable and I get lots of compliments on it anyway!"
3.0,"Looked well made. Great design/good size, however, it was returned as I didn't like the open parts on each end of the zipper/bag."
3.0,"Small, sparse wig."
3.0,"This was our 2nd pair, but the quality of the leather is now more of a vinyl material.  Not near as nice as they used to be."
3.0,water still find it way in
3.0,Overall OK but larger than expected
3.0,The fabric is very thin and see through.  I love the pockets and the length.  Very comfortable dress.  I just wish the fabric was of better material.
3.0,"To small, gave them away for gifts. But they are very pretty."
3.0,"These are beyond comfortable and fit will!! I am 5'9"" got them in medium and they fit high on waist (yay!) and still reach my ankles. Im leaving 3 stars because I bought them in tie dye and they're not nearly as bright as what is pictured which is disappointing."
3.0,Item arrived very quickly.  Nice assorted colors.  I've never worn an accessory such as this before with suits.  Good deal for the quantity and price.
3.0,"This boot jack is working well, but it seems misleading to describe it as ""heavy duty"". It flexes significantly when I step on it to hold it while pulling a boot off my other foot. Hasn't broken yet though, and I've been using it multiple times a day for weeks now."
3.0,stone is small
3.0,"Nice fabric, well done, very fresh<br />Cons: in the lighter colors of the fabric you can see trough"
3.0,good but small
3.0,lil small. Still I like it.
3.0,"Verrrry thin and lightweight. Warm, Not sure how warm it’s going to be for Michigan, but we shall see. Put together well and is a really good looking jacket."
3.0,"They are more stiff than they look in the pictures. They look like a flowy comfy cotton material, but instead are a stiff khaki thick material."
3.0,"Being in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, these were purchased for legs swelling.  Extrememly uncomfortable!  Not sure if it was the socks or just compression socks.<br /><br />Very nice quality sock."
3.0,This is not a bad dress but for my body it was not very flattering.
3.0,some of the stones were out of it
3.0,"I ordered a size that should fit and am swimming in this top. Very sad, this material is very soft and the shirt is beautiful, albeit a bit thin.  Do not order up when buying as these fit larger than expected.  Very long in the torso, I'm 4'10&#34; and could easily make this a scandalous dress."
3.0,They are great for spring and fall but I don't think they will be very warm this winter. they are nicely made just not heavy enough for me.
3.0,"The fabric kinda feels like those thick vinyl/plastic table cloths. The fastener at the neck doesn’t hold all that well, but it works.<br />I needed something cow print ASAP and this was cheap and arrived quickly with prime. But it you’re looking for a high quality apron with fasteners that you don’t have to re-tighten every 10 mins, I would get a different one."
3.0,Arms are very loose. Thin material.
3.0,"Small children size, don’t waste your money unless 8 and younger....do buy the adult version it’s super awesome!"
3.0,"I purchased this because my babies hair was breaking off in the back possibly from laying down or pulling it out. It’s cute but she won’t keep it on. With a small infant this is a struggle more than a help.<br /><br />I found that if I wait until she is really sleepy and put it on right before bedtime, it may stay on through the night but if she is awake, that thing is coming off lol.<br /><br />It’s a good product just wish it had a little more security for active infants."
3.0,Cute but they don't stay on so well.
3.0,too bulky and strange shape fit. So I return it.
3.0,Love them… but they’re a little thin.
3.0,This suit is perfect for my water aerobics class during the winter months. It keeps me warm in the water even when the water is a little chilly. Only problem is I had to replace the zipper.
3.0,"These look like they would be nice, and maybe for women with small hips, thighs and butt. I have 40&#34; hips and a 30&#34; waist with athletic, but not slim thighs. The product is VERY tight around my thighs, too snug around my hips and doesn't cover my tush very well. They also feel a bit weird in the crotch area. I'm 5'7&#34; and 145lbs, so not a large person, but the L/XL is too small for me..."
3.0,Great pendant just wish the chain wasn't so small and thin. And it came with a nott in it.
3.0,"These are cute, and fine for the price.  I don't think they'd be safe for a real little kid who puts everything in their mouth."
3.0,"These are difficult to get on and by the end of the night, my earlobes were red but they looked nice and I got compliments so I would recommend just not for longer than a few hours of wear."
3.0,ran small in size
3.0,beautiful...but the thinner chains broke first time wearing it
3.0,todo
3.0,The jacket is actually pretty good but the shirt is super cheap and see thru also the shipping was ridiculous!!  The dates kept changing and it took almost 30 days for it to arrive but since it came by Halloween I was not that upset but it literally got there two days before and I ordered it on October 3. I would not order this again or recommend it I couldn’t even use the shirt and def order one size up if you do order it!
3.0,"You don't want to go to church in this jumpsuit. It is tight and shows off the curves. The largest size they have available can only accommodate a 40 inch bust. Now, I am looking at the picture of the curvaceous woman modeling the jumpsuit and I just don't know how any of the sizes can contain her. If you are looking for something sexy and you have the body for this, go for it."
3.0,U can see right through it. I just use mine around the house
3.0,"These are okay, but very on the small side"
3.0,"The meter probes are actually a lot better quality than I expected<br /><br />The meter probes are actually a lot better quality than I expected. They arrived 2 weeks ahead of schedule. But, unfortunately, somebody (Amazon?) included my PHONE NUMBER with my address which wound up on  the outside of the package. I don't appreciate that."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this suit. I love this style, but it runs a little small. I am 5-ft 1/2 in tall, 138 lbs, with a large behind and middle-aged body, normal size is 8 or M. I ordered this in Medium. I really like the wide waistband of the bottoms, but the waist is VERY tight. It's so tight, the bottoms look like bloomers before I put them on. The rest of the bottoms fit well, but that waistband being so tight gave me the most awful 'muffin top'. (Normally, size medium doesn't do this to me.) And with that, it makes the top fit really tight around my middle and look awful. I am returning it.<br /><br />Additionally, I know the front pockets are fake. However, the back pockets seem to be real in looking at the photos. I even asked and the seller stated that the back pockets are real. However, the pair I received only had stitching in the shape of a pocket, no actual pockets! It makes no difference one way or the other, but don't lie to me and tell me they are real when they are not. And if they are supposed to have pockets, then I received a defective pair!<br /><br />I think this is more of a seller issue than a product issue, so not counting the pocket issue against my review. The original 3-star remains as related to the sizing of this suit."
3.0,Looks heavy duty but too light weight. But does hold up. Easy to become unbuckled
3.0,"Not a bad looking watch, but band is MUCH deeper pink than pictured. The face is actually nicer looking.<br />My daughter liked the cute saying on the face. Price was reasonable so decided to try it. The watch is working<br />well so far, but we only have it for two weeks."
3.0,not the real deal... the Mrs. don't care....
3.0,"Well I thought it was a hard side type of handbag, it feels so flimsy and soft...I don't know about that and I thought there was an outside pocket? or darn..not really happy...I wish it was hard sided with an outside pocket and another pocket on the inside...hmmm...thinking about returning it...and selecting another."
3.0,"Bought this for a gift, seemed to have a spot on brim but I think it will be okay. Ive been trying to put together a ladies gift set together and this is perfect for that!"
3.0,"These fit me so strangely. They were skin-tight from the waist to the knees then were too long/wide at the bottom. I bought these to wear to a beach resort, and the fabric just felt too sweaty."
3.0,"The pearls are great, however the post on one is bent and has a small hook on the end there by makind it hard to put the back on and off."
3.0,looks fine from the exterior but the lining rips quickly
3.0,"Love the shoe horn functionality but the blue paint job is terrible. As soon as I opened the package the blue paint literally started cracking and flaking off without even touching the shoe horn. Since then, almost all of the blue finish is gone on the handle end of the shoe horn. Aesthetically it does not bother me as the shiny silver underneath is OK but the problem is the blue paint specks end up everywhere while using the product. At least until the paint is completely gone. Too bad, if the finish had been done properly I would have given the product 5 stars."
3.0,"pants were huge, fit was very baggy and unattractive."
3.0,"This product is slightly bigger than expected. It’s a good quality kimono and looks just like the picture. I didn’t really appreciate the gold strings on the sleeves or below the busy area, I think it makes the kimono look a bit cheap."
3.0,These didn’t fit to size completely.
3.0,"Gold Toe quality, but not the thick ones I've been looking for"
3.0,I really love the look and quality of these pants but they were just not big enough.  I ordered according to the size chart and they were too small.  I am hoping to get them in a larger size when they are back in stock.
3.0,"Purchased these to replace a taupe pair I lost that I had for years.  These definitely are not as warm or thick as the old pair.  They will do for short amount of times in the cold, but don't plan on using them for extended periods out in the cold."
3.0,"ordered the size it said too, ended up being a size too small.  Going for the next size up"
3.0,"Love these bc they look like my cat! I docked one star bc the hole part does have a weird black mark. I wish these were a little bigger. Also, they sent a free pair of earrings that I love: the girl cat from the Aristocats!"
3.0,Way bigger than expected but pretty
3.0,I’m not sure if it was supposed to fit like this or not but I didn’t like it. I got an xl. So beware for thicker women.
3.0,"More like trouser socks, no much compression.  They are soft and adorable though!"
3.0,"I like this design and to this day I still wear the thing. But its very thin and bends a lot. While at work I lift a lot of heavy stuff and god forbid I get my hand squished at all, this thing pinches the feeling right out of my finger."
3.0,The fabric these are made from was irritating to my skin.
3.0,"I should have read further reviews.  This dress is so cute straight from the package.  However, the quality of the fabric is not great.  It becomes almost totally white when stretched.  This is a bit awkward when stretched across a chest 🤦‍♀️<br /><br />Additionally, I've washed it twice - once before wearing and once after.  I hung it both times to dry.  It looks like an old dress now.  It showed nubs under the arms by the end of the day that I wore it.<br /><br />Cute, but not sure I'd buy again knowing the quality."
3.0,Good until the clip for the strap broke
3.0,"This isn't the most extravagant collar I've every seen, but it is leather and has great quality snaps on the back. It's a bit small, so if you have a larger neck this might not fit. I love the heart instead of the more traditional ring, but I do wish it was made from a better quality metal as it looks cheap and will probably rusted or discolor over time. Lastly I wouldn't wear this collar for any type of bdsm scene because of the way the heart sits on your wind pipe. I would worry that it would cause injury if worn during any type of heavy play, but it is a great piece to be worn out as jewelry."
3.0,They look glass in the picture they look cheap and plastic in real life lol.
3.0,"I ordered navy. This is actually black with aqua polka dots. Nice, but I was trying to stay away from black bathing suits, which is why I ordered this, because the description says navy."
3.0,"I like this hat the way it is supposed to look, but I can’t stop the brim being scrunched up. I wrote asking how to fix this but no answer 😧"
3.0,Tight on neck will need extender
3.0,"I checked the size chart and ordered per it and my normal size, and the skirt was a bit snug.  I didn't look closely at the photo of the skirt before I ordered it and didn't realize it had blue in it - my fault.  I kept the skirt anyway.  It's a nice midi."
3.0,It was a gift for a friend. Very beautiful but heavy. The size was perfect since the individual has large wrist
3.0,I did not like the fabric it felt thin and cheap. I returned it. I did really like the color tho!
3.0,XL sock toe box too small for size 13 male foot.
3.0,"good socks just  to big for youth, they go over their knees 11-12 year olds"
3.0,"I ordered the shirt  a size larger than the 2nd shirt I purchased, and oddly enough, it fit tighter than the other.  This shirt runs a little small for the size indicated so keep that in mind when ordering.  Otherwise, it is a pretty shirt."
3.0,It's too small....but it a nice dress.  Maybe I'll get a large
3.0,Runs really short. Not necessarily a dress.
3.0,"size is for sure incorrect, i purchased them for my middleschooler kids but end up giving it to my elementary schooler"
3.0,Average.....but ok for the price
3.0,"I understand that this is high waisted, but it goes up to my collar bones and still past my ankles. It’s very thin material so any underwear lines stand out like a sore thumb, best to not even wear anything under.<br />It’s a very pretty skirt other than those minor issues, probably manageable to make it fit the way one would want to.<br />I’d talk about the fit but I’ve recently gained some weight and I’m still coming to terms with it and the way my body looks now 😅"
3.0,"About Apple Watch band color in gray, 1st thing its dose does not look like as gray, More White than gray. 2nd The band it is very lightweight. not worth for $10, I guess $5 or less"
3.0,"I use this to wrap my hair at night to protect my curls and from damage. It's an okay scarf, but I think the price point is way off. It's more expensive than it's worth, I believe."
3.0,Go up a size from your original
3.0,Takes over a month to get your purchase. The savings is NOT worth the wait.
3.0,"Bought these for my child because she likes my Ray-Ban Aviators.  They’re decent sunglasses for the price, but they were a good bit lighter than my Ray-Bans."
3.0,You really need to size up if you have a large bust (34DDD) and your stomach isn’t absolutely flat.  Couldn’t button it in all areas.
3.0,"This was a sized small presumably Perry Ellis lambskin leather jacket. It had a fixed lining along with two outer and inner pockets. From afar, it was nice looking but upon further inspection had multiple blemishes/scuff marks and was tight around the chest. Although this had the Perry Ellis label on the inside top between the shoulders, the materials/manufacturing tag was generic and simply stated leather and dry cleaning. An actual Perry Ellis jacket purchased from PE had the PE name and all the details related to the composition of the jacket printed on the interior materials/manufacturing tag."
3.0,"small in the thigh, big in the waist.  As a result they're always sliding down."
3.0,These are cut oddly and concequently don't like to stay up well. They are very long which is great for me because I have long legs and plus sized clothing always seems to be short. However the ankkes and calves are tight and it causes the pants to want to slide down despite the top half fitting well. They tend to bunch around my ankles and make the crotch gap oddly. They are super soft and snoith and the pocket it perfect for my phone and the length is perfect so I want to love them but I spend all day pulling them up...
3.0,Of the 6 shirts I ordered...3 must have been mistakenly tagged....As they were smaller than the other XXLs
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, I tried it in 2 sizes, but the waist just didn't hit in the right place."
3.0,"One has to look very carefully at the scarf photo to see that only one side of the scarf is printed.  I didn’t look at it carefully, but I learned my lesson.  It’s a nice scarf about 83 inches long at maximum length.  It’s shaped like a long parallelogram (ends are tapered).  The ends are fringed with no hemming.  The color is camel with black and cinnamon colored cross plaid stripes.  It’s warm, but then I don’t live in a very cold place.  It’s made of 100% acrylic and made in Germany.<br /><br />I gave it 2 fewer stars, because when I wear it around my neck, the unprinted side shows.  It takes a little bit of time to arrange it so it doesn’t show.  In my opinion, it’s a little expensive for a scarf printed only on one side."
3.0,"its a good quality. but shallow, and small circumference. I gave it to my 10 yr old neice, she loves it. so that's good"
3.0,Very beautiful! Unfortunately the chain broke into two different parts after a couple days of wearing it.
3.0,These are great for normal or narrow feet. These are tough to get on for a wider foot. I am sure these are wonderful but my wide foot son could not even get half his foot in these. So Adidas for his soccer shoe.
3.0,"I ended up returning and reordering every size in this because I didn't know what I was. The first time they sent the wrong size so I was extra confused. I ended up with an XL but should have returned it for a 4th time to get the L. It's very cute but too big for me. I wanted it for an up coming trip so I didn't think I would have time to order again but I wish I had. It is really cute and I wore it to the pool a couple times but was too uncomfortable in it since it was too big. I would say, sizing is true to size since I am a M/L and should have gotten a L. The M fit but was so tight it was see through in the back. For reference I am 5'5&#34; 150* 34C."
3.0,Bummer because it looks nice!
3.0,"This is way more complicated to put on than what it looks.  The pieces are really hard to tell apart and there is no guide or set of instructions to help with that.  It is really cute when you get it on, but definitely plan on taking a good chunk of time and patience figuring out how to get it on.  It is a bit smaller than I expected, which I'm not really used to at a size 0, but I was still able to make it work.  The lace is pretty thick compared to other lingerie that i have tried, so I think this will hold up for awhile.  It does look as pictured when you are able to figure it out and get it on.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I certify that my reviews are based on my own opinions and experiences with the product. I received no compensation for my reviews and I am not obligated to leave a positive review."
3.0,"The fabric it too rough on skin and it doesn’t hold the 3D shape like other kf94s. It attaches to the lip and nose. Therefore, makes it hard to breathe"
3.0,nice dress to tight around my arms. should've order 2 size up
3.0,Too big in the chest area!
3.0,My favorite cap I awhile but man white gets fast quick.
3.0,"Somewhat disappointed in the gold tone which looks sort of fake. These would be much prettier if this were silver, but they are still really nice with good colors."
3.0,They run a little small or I would give them 5 star.
3.0,"Arrived on time and it super tiny!! And very pretty which I liked. It fit well but the first day I got it, I washed my face that night as I was drying my face it just snapped right off!! And since it's so tiny I couldn't even find it!"
3.0,"The bottoms fit like poorly made underwear. Not comfortable or even easy for ""fun"""
3.0,Couldn't see clearly.
3.0,"It arrived with an odd smell that thankfully washes out well, but unfortunately for me, the mask is too big for my face :(<br />The mask is very cute and soft, it's just not quite right for me."
3.0,"Love the fabric, style but it runs small"
3.0,It's small and hard to put on wnist
3.0,"They are very pretty and seem well constructed but I was shocked at how large they were. Sadly, I couldn't wear them and had to give them away."
3.0,"If you think you are a medium, order a large."
3.0,the material is cheap and the colors are off. it also runs small so i’d say size up
3.0,I LOVE the headband but my daughter wore it today for pictures at school and the eye already fell off :-(
3.0,Smallest size available was small/medium; this size is too large for gift recipient.
3.0,Cute but a little tighter than I like
3.0,"Adorable shirt, but just know, this is a large screen print, so you’ll feel the plastic backing on the inside"
3.0,The shipment just a little slow but is okay.Well im not vey tall for a girl so the mask covers my entire neck and face.It smells a little like doctors gloves but is a minor smell and I can barely see in this mask. Well now I cant scare the s*** out of people!
3.0,Way bigger than expected. They'll fit my 17 month old in probably a year.
3.0,"Very thin, poor quality. Decided to keep"
3.0,GOOD DRESS COME TO SMALL!
3.0,"I am 5'2"" so the short inseam was okay for me. I took the advice of Amazon and ordered a size up. They are eay to big.  I did try to wash and shrink them, I should have purchased the medium. 🙄"
3.0,These are very thick. M daughter wouldn’t not wear them
3.0,I purchased one for myself in size 7 and loved it. Everything was well coated in SS and I wear it every day. I bought one for my daughter in size 6 and it came completely blackened on the inside - no SS coating whatsoever. Had to return it. Very disappointing. So I'm averaging the reviews to a 3.
3.0,Cute but the boba tea glass was broken and I got multiple same colored gummy bears.<br />The fish are adorable.
3.0,"Picked up this little beauty for my honey for Christmas. I know she prefers smaller bags to full sized ones. She likes darker colors with leather being one of her favorites. This little bag has so much potential but has a few not so great points that caused it to be passed on. It arrives flattened out with a bar of foam the bag bottom is wrapped around. Not a big issue but don't usually like it when an item is distorted by packaging. This handbag feels wonderful to the touch, your hands will love the supple softness. The front of the bag has two zippered compartments. The zipper grippers are really pretty and well made. The zippers themselves are large and shiny silver with the very smoothest pull. Sadly the zippers on top, the rear and inside the bag are plastic and not nearly as nice-so what happened? The inside of the purse is very basic without frills, the storage compartments are just that. Minimal extra pockets or compartments inside. Again, not an issue. But the shoulder strap is seatbelt material, like out of your car. I like the clips on the ends of the strap. But the strap should have been leather too. Not a loser by any means but passed on by my wife. I will have no problem gifting this out to a friend."
3.0,It was nice but very low quality material. Super thin
3.0,"Nice product, but they make you look like the cartoon character, Mr.Peabody."
3.0,"Color is much more darker than on picture. It is dark navy very hard to see camouflage, almost like it's not even there."
3.0,Cute easy summer dress. It’s just very short waisted. Would be great for a petite. Im 5’8 and busty-the waist hit right under the bust line and pooched out like a maternity dress -not a good look
3.0,I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  I expected something with more substance to it for the coming cold months.
3.0,I thought it would be bigger than it is.
3.0,"It’s a decent item, but the person we bought it for is a 2X, so we bought a 4x so it was really big. It was so small that she couldn’t even get it on.  It fit like a Medium in the US."
3.0,"Shirt fits good, it looks nice but the material feels a lil heavy."
3.0,"I love these. So comfy and nice and thick. Very well made.<br />Update: I got 3 of these.... so far only 2 have been delivered, but they were not the same size. (I ordered 2 larges and they are totally different sizes) The pink one fit great. the white was super tight and I could barely get it on. I am keeping it because I made it work but I hate when sizes are not consistent. I just ordered 2 of a different style so I hope those are better for size comparison."
3.0,Poor quality boot as does came apart two months of wear. Not purchase again
3.0,Fogs. Leaks. Poor design
3.0,Good price but shipping took way too long!
3.0,I read the reviews carefully before ordering and got the coat today: I am 5'8&#34; and 140lb- would usually wear a small in a coat- based on reviews I ordered a large and it fits ok- you can go smaller if you have a small waist. The style is cute and the asymmetrical hem makes it unique. The cost was terribly wrinkled so I ironed it- looks somewhat better. The sleeves are way too long but I can alter them. I do not like hoods so I carefully  cut the hood off- you can't  see where it was bc the collar hides the seam. All in all it was worth $30 but don't expect a perfect product.
3.0,Overall good shirt. A bit short for my height when compared to their other type of shirts they offer that I own.<br /><br />This material is different and is a more cotton feel that the slub variant.
3.0,"It looks like a beautiful suit, but there is no support at all for anyone who needs it."
3.0,"Though the quality and prints looked good, I was disappointed to see that the package was not complete. I did not come with forks, spoon, dessert plates and one table mat!! That’s a lot of missing stuff...I am 2 day awas  from my son’ bday party and now I have to rush to the store to pick whatever is available"
3.0,Looks great but the pants strap broke right away. The shirt is very nice though and made much better.
3.0,Gems fell out quickly
3.0,It is wide enough to hold a laptop and maybe the charger.  Good if you don't intend on carrying  a lot.
3.0,"Tight in the busy , waist hits way to high. Runs very small. Just ok. Would wear around the house or as a cover up."
3.0,"My first review didn't go through but I will say like I did before that I ordered 3 packs of these beads (blue, green, and purple). I do love them, they look very nice on my snake chain bracelet. But as far as the blue beads are concerned, I received only 6 of them instead of the 10 I paid for. I will order more if the missing beads are being replaced."
3.0,"I received this dress and it had a stain at the neckline and a spot on the chiffon. I contacted the sell who asked me to have it cleaned and they would reimburse $20. I carefully hand washed it twice, soaking for 2 hours and they stain did come out. Since this dress was for my daughters wedding I didn’t have time to send back to China. I had to have alterations done including the built in bra removed because it was so large. So, if you are willing to go thru all this effort, it is a pretty dress."
3.0,The bracelet is pretty but way too big for my hand and the  stones were bigger than they appeared (at least to me) in the picture.
3.0,I liked the color and feel and look. But being a Jr. Fit I ordered a medium as that is what I typically wear and it was small feeling. I am trim person not skinny. I workout so I have muscles. The arms were tight and the upper back was tight. Was afraid it would split it I brought my arms forward. I recently bought a flannel from Amazon and ordered a large. Glad a did. If I order this shirt again it will be a large.
3.0,"It's what I wanted, but not what I wanted.  Very pretty and very light weight."
3.0,A little too stretchy for me but it's got it's place.
3.0,"The fabric is less tshirt-ey and more leggings/spandex/stretchy which means it didn't fall the way I expected (clingy/not flowy). The quality is ok, however there are lots of threads that need to be trimmed before wearing which makes me question how long this will last. This will be pared with workout leggings for lazy days. I had hoped it could be dressed up to go out, but I'm afraid the material is just too casual."
3.0,"The shirt was nice, and the cummerbund, tie, and studs/cuff-links were not as cheap as I expected.  The shirt fit my son well, but was rather thin.  I know it wasn't an expensive shirt, but it also wasn't exactly cheap.  I thought it could have been a little thicker quality.  My son wore a t-shirt under it, and otherwise it looked really good on him.  He wore it to his prom with my old tux and it looked nice as part of the whole outfit."
3.0,"It was a little bigger than expected so I was somewhat disappointed but it came on time so overall, it was a-ok."
3.0,"I had to take this dress in - I was drowning in the extra-small.  The pocket looked weird, so I removed it.  With adjustments, it's a nice dress for the price."
3.0,Too much to bother with. Felt like a mummy attempting to wrap myself
3.0,"Love the materials(rayon)!and the tie-dye design; however,the sizing was too small! I'm returning as soon as I can!  I'm disturbed about which size to chose & to order!"
3.0,Had a weird smell
3.0,This would be helpful if the mask was larger and had something for bracket to clip to
3.0,Do not know how to explain this.  The more it stretches the less bright the colors are.  I would normally wear a L/XL.  I purchased a large and it was entirely too long and the curves did not line up with my curves and it did not look good.  Sent back to get a medium and the curves fit nicely but the material was so stretched that the colors did not pop like they do in the picture.  I think it is because of the white colored &#34;slip&#34; layer... If it was black I think it would have been better.
3.0,I bought a size up and it was still too small to be comfortable. I would recommend buying 2 sizes up
3.0,"A little tight, but helps me keep traction on the pool floor."
3.0,"Great shirt, but ran small"
3.0,"These shorts are very comfortable, good fabric, but several inches shorter than the shown. These are not as described in the length I  bought them because I wanted Bermuda shorts, which are knee length. These are not.  I am only 5”2” so it’s not because of my height"
3.0,"It’s not apricot, it’s khaki tan. But it fits and looks well-made."
3.0,I absolutely love this dress... the fit is perfect.. I'm giving it 3 stars because of those gawdy ruffles that you don't see in the pictures...if they just were double sided it would be perect
3.0,"LOVE the fit of this jumpsuit and it is super flattering and comfy. However, it’s so sheet that you could see straight through to my butt without me even bending over (and I bought it in the black color). Disappointed, wish the fabric was better"
3.0,The one I received is fake. SMH.
3.0,The fit is OK but I feel like it is not flattering on me. The one thing that I noticed about this as soon as I opened it was the horrible smell. If you’re sensitive to smells you do not want to get this. The color is as expected  But it is thin material
3.0,"the idea is good, but the material used is too flimsy...one of the corners was broken when it arrived!"
3.0,Little small in size but good to sleep or lounge in
3.0,"It was made of a poor quality fabric. It felt “cheap.” Sure it’s a sweatshirt, but definitely has a sweatshop feel to it."
3.0,"Overall I'm pretty pleased with the product. I does what it says- and kept me dry through a few Midwestern downpours while running/biking. My main complaint has to do with the zipper, on the front pocket, that constantly catches on the fabric and gets stuck. I finally got tired of it and used a pliers to close it permanently. I would suggest either doing away with the pocket, or providing a better zipper."
3.0,Pretty pajamas but sleeves and bottoms way too long and material not warm like knit. I was disappointed. I hemmed the pants and roll up arm sleeves a lot.
3.0,Good quality. Much longer than expected. Returned.
3.0,"Very thin plastic, feels like it will break easily. Looks nice otherwise"
3.0,Only fits on the moto 360 with so modiying. The color on the band wears off quickly though.
3.0,"The hat in and of itself is really very nice, I think it's quite cool personally. Looks to be good quality too. However, it fit like an XL though I had ordered a Small. I'm pretty certain I was sent a mismarked item because we measured 23&#34; inside the hat. Pity as it was for my sister's wedding."
3.0,looks low quality
3.0,Wasn't what my daughter was expecting.
3.0,"Cute, but very thin and see thru"
3.0,It looked just like the photo.  I was disappointed when I saw some of the white threading was pulled.
3.0,"Somewhat large, but acceptable.  Very disappointed that the hat is marked &#34;made in Italy&#34;, when it was originally advertised as &#34;made in Poland&#34;.  That was the main reason I purchased the hat."
3.0,I agree with other reviewers that these cross the line into costume territory. I consider myself to have a large head so I thought they might work but no dice. A little bit smaller and they would be very chic. I will be returning them.
3.0,cute while they lasted but the gold tassels continuously fall off
3.0,This shirt is so cute but it was to small! I ordered extra large which is what I usually wear but was way to tight around my belly iam 215 and 5'5. I wish there was bigger sizes!
3.0,"The fabric seemed fine, fit was fine, but the colors just did not look anything like the picture. The colors were really dull and not as bright as the picture. And the pattern was not at all similar."
3.0,Leather was very stiff.
3.0,"I love the look and feel of this dress EXCEPT, as other reviewers have noted, the front opens up a couple inches under my crotch. I ordered a large - I’m 5’7”, 170 lbs, and have a somewhat long torso. It fits great everywhere else, but is unwearable without some majorly opaque leggings (which is not the look I’m going for). Too bad!!"
3.0,"I thought these shoes would be durable, however we have only had them for a month and my 4 year old has already worn holes in both of the toes."
3.0,Runs small! Wish it was bigger but it still fits
3.0,"Dosnt fit me like the pic, of course I don’t have the same body shape..."
3.0,For an adult male with a rather small head circumference it was very tight
3.0,Runs smaller than true to size
3.0,The arm lace was overpowering for me.
3.0,These are some tiny earrings.  Smaller then a dime... baby size earrings.
3.0,"They are cute, but they don't fit my 7 month old (size infant 3), they are too big. I have to wait till she grows more which defeats the purpose of her having them...since I was looking for an immediate fix."
3.0,there's okay
3.0,"Fit more like a regular size 4, not a 4T"
3.0,"This blouse is 100 percent polyester, not 70% with 30% cotton as stated. It's light material, not textured, and it doesn't breathe despite its thinness. It also runs small - the size chart is misleading.<br /><br />It's attractive but not something I'll wear on a very hot day, not even hanging open over a tank top. One hundred percent polyester just doesn't cut it for a nice, cool fit."
3.0,"More than a couple of traditional ear piercings are silly. I mean, piercings are a thing of the 90s and not edgy or interesting today. They are desperate. But if you want to trick someone these work great."
3.0,"Ordered a medium, I usually wear a medium. Sleeves are too short and the material is the cheaper Sherpa that will Matte down easily after a couple of washes."
3.0,"These were a great price and the kids loved them -- the ones that worked, that is. About 1/4 of the lights in the bag didn't actually work. Fortunately, with 40 in the bag, we still got about 28 or 30 that did work, and that was plenty. These are definitely cheaply made and won't last long, but they're fine for what we got them for -- cheap, silly party favors for kids."
3.0,"The compression is okay. They work. HOWEVER, one sock is substantially longer than the other sock! It just doesn’t look good or feel good to have 1 sock a few inches longer than the other. It’s kind of annoying actually. I wear these socks for travel purposes, planes, trains, automobiles, if you will. I just hate that every time I put them on- one sock is way longer."
3.0,I loved the color of the dress and it didn’t look too cheap or sheer. But the wrap on the dress was too small. Plenty of ribbon to stretch across so it wasn’t a sizing issue. The wrap part came up short and didn’t match the rest of the dress. Made it look defective.
3.0,"Lovely bag, but in my opinion it is too big to be a crossbody."
3.0,"The design of the necklace is pretty, but the size is much smaller than anticipated. I was a little disappointed, but not enough to send it back,"
3.0,Nice hat however my head is a little larger than I thought
3.0,Good slim fit with relax waist nice
3.0,Extra large and xx large is the same size  Manfred D
3.0,The handle fell off the very first trip.  Can the company please send me a replacement handle?
3.0,"It is very loose, it's not made to be form fitting. Not my style, decided to return but had no problems with that."
3.0,"Torso is normal sized, upper arms and shoulders are gigantic"
3.0,I wish these fit! The calf was just too snug to zip up!
3.0,Words are spelled incorrectly on 2/3 of these shirts one says “supper star” instead of “super star” and the other says “happy everday” instead of “happy everYday”. The other one is really cute and all in all would be cute shirts except the spelling errors.
3.0,Did not like this product. It was supposed to be for a man and it looked girly
3.0,The only reason I did not give these collar extenders 4 stars is because of the color. The bright gold is just yucky.
3.0,Meh...the face on mine is kinda stretched and blurry. Not a cute detailed face  like the picture..also the back is a straight lin kinda brooch..no big deal but I thought it'd be the push kind..disappointed in how the face looks..
3.0,Can wear
3.0,I liked my Reba sandals and thought the tennis shoes would be the same. Nope. No support or cushion really. Okay for a grocery run but not for long distance walking running.
3.0,one size to small. instructions should suggest go up a size
3.0,"I liked the look of the ankle bracelet, however the warning of not getting it wet was a big turn off for me.  I was looking forward to wearing it to the beach. The description made it sound as if it wouldn't last long afterwards if I did that. I returned it."
3.0,"Not comfortable. Cute to just wear, not very ideal for working out. It's definitely breathable, but on me, it feels too tight around my shoulders and armpits, and doesn't feel like the greatest quality. So-so on whether I'd buy again."
3.0,Catches on clothing.
3.0,Love the material. Wish I had ordered a size down. I still like the fit. Will definitely order again in smaller size.
3.0,"This is not one size fits all.  At least not in the sleeves.  I bought it for my 15 YO daughter and the sleeves don't even come down to her wrists.  Also, it came with a horrible musty/mildew smell that didn't even go away with a washing.  Has gotten slightly better with time.  She still loves it, though."
3.0,"Kinda thin, you get what you pay for, 3 stars because it is cute"
3.0,"Not so impressed with product, barely fits my glasses. fairly quick delivery."
3.0,Very nice the price is good.
3.0,"Love it ! Very warm, double layer knit.  Not as slouchy as picture shows. It is stiffer and stands up more- maybe it just needs to be broken in."
3.0,Fit a little weird for a size large wasn’t as loose as I thought it would be  but it is super comfortable. I just wish it was made for fluffy girls maybe then it would have fit as expected.
3.0,"We ordered the blue and it is a great color. It came with a hair tie as most do, however it is quite painful for my child. By the end of a 30 gymnastic training she had red abrasions on her inner thigh. She did not contain of pain until after. It fits well, my daughter is 3, 47 lbs,  3 1/2 ft tall and we got the size 6/7."
3.0,"Not large enough in size.  Material nice,  sizes are off"
3.0,"The material is good quality,  fit good, my husband is 5'11...big head lol!<br />But the Aerosmith logo is very very tiny, and is not embroidery is printed which is fine, but in the picture is a good size print, the real item is so tiny printed that you have to get close to the person to see it."
3.0,"The material is very thin, but it's very long, and can be wraped around a few times. Like the light colored pink.."
3.0,"While the gloves are comfortable, they are NOT truly designed for really cold weather. Below freezing temperatures, they are no better than any other winter gloves. Your fingers will get COLD !"
3.0,Too shallow for me ear. Looks nice though.
3.0,"I like the style, but am afraid of getting blisters since they slip and seem larger than my size. I ordered a 7 1/2 because I vary between 7 1/2 and 8 and thought they would fit better."
3.0,These are adorable.  I love the way they look. However be prepared to fix the bracket and even earrings from time to time bc they are cheaply made and put together.
3.0,I was so excited when I got this
3.0,"Like the style and the color and the matching hat is cute for sure. Ordered in 3X as well as the tankini 2 piece in 3X. Tankini fit perfectly,  the 3X in this was too large on the bottom and way too large on the top.  Returned the 3X for a 2X - the bottom on that fit properly but was still to large on top. I wear a C cup and the top was still too loose, almost flattering. This suit is definitely made for a well endowed woman."
3.0,Good  for a little girl.
3.0,"Very thin, good for bathing suit cover up not solely as a dress."
3.0,This is the material I wanted for my husband.  His watch band broke and he likes the silicon ones because he is in water a lot.  Bought this - when it arrived it was more like a women's band than a man's.  He is using it - but we are still looking for the right replacement.
3.0,"The gray pair came with a blue mark on the left leg. I decided I didn't care and would just wear this pair around the house. I've worn them once, and all ready there is a run on the opposite leg as the blue marker spot. Tried stain remover on the blue ink but it didn't work."
3.0,It was tight on my wrist. Like the colors they were bright.
3.0,Nice enough. But it was a little too flimsy for my tastes. Perhaps other colors with cute short-sleeved crop tops would be better. I don't know..
3.0,I like bit short
3.0,"My fingers are blue from the fabric.<br />Love the style, expensive shipping"
3.0,"For the price, they are very cute.  They do get tangled quite easily though!"
3.0,"Good for only carryon, lost first time bag was checked."
3.0,They are nice but way too large!
3.0,I ordered a large based on the reviews. I'm 5ft 2in and weigh 199. It was tight across the chest and it was a bit too long for me. I would size up but then would have to shorten and not worth it. Dress made very nice and wish it worked for me.
3.0,These work ok but given how small the ear ones are it can be tricky to keep them on if you use for your nose. Everytime I use for my nose I end up losing it. You basically need to be very careful not to accidentally touch it or you’ll lose it.
3.0,The shirt is very nice and material seems of good quality however it does run a little small small
3.0,"I gave this a three because the size wasn't accurate, other than that the quality and look were spot on"
3.0,"I like these style of bandanas, and have actually added loops to some bandanas that I have to wear at work. The only issue is that there is only a single layer of fabric, and from everything I’ve seen and read, and the requirements they’ve given us at work, I need something with two layers of fabric. It’s easy enough to tack another piece of fabric along the top hem to meet the requirement and the ear loops make it easy to don it quickly or drop it to hang around your neck.<br /><br />I received this item for free in return for a fair and honest review."
3.0,Needed they next size up
3.0,Very cute glasses. Love the blue very deep and very polarized. My only thing for these glasses is the ugly black brim at the top of the glasses it looks like you have black eyebrows when you take pics other than that great
3.0,It was not what I thought it would be at all. It was too small at the waist too large at breast. I ordered a small and I'm a 34c. Also the material is very sheer. I made it work for the night but I'm giving it to my friend so she can wear on the beach instead.
3.0,"This cardigan is cute, but the material is thin and sort of silky. Not entirely what I was expecting. Better for fall wear, than winter wear."
3.0,Great fashion piece to add a little sparkle to any outfit.
3.0,to tight. hard to get the card out
3.0,I really like this piece for the outfit I bought it for. My only disappointment is that it looked more like something that I would get from a beauty supply store that sells descent quality costume jewelry. It doesn't look so cheap that I can't dress it up with the right outfit  though. No regrets here.
3.0,"They week fine, love them but ran small."
3.0,arm holes are kinda tiny.
3.0,No size tag
3.0,I wish it were a different material but it's still very cute
3.0,The material feels like a Halloween costume kinda it's quite a bit shorter and wider around the waist/mid section....
3.0,Wasn't as large I as thought it was going to be. Zipper broke after 3 times of using it.
3.0,The diamond kind of moves around but they’re still good.
3.0,Does not come off the shoulder like it shows in the picture but it still cute on! It fits good but too small to try to wear off the shoulder.
3.0,"I should have paid more attention to the fact that it's really not a purse but a bag, but that's okay."
3.0,I own several pair. This last order proves to me the sizes are inconsistent. Best to go to a store or you risk disappointing experience. Not made in America...what do you expect!
3.0,The ring is a bit bulky. The emerald should be a bit smaller or at least the silver metal not as wide. You can't tell from the picture. That's just my personal taste/opinion but I still wear it mostly everyday.
3.0,"The dress has very good material quality and is made well, however, the sizing is off in the bust area. I was gonna send it back, but instead I ended up cutting off the top part and making the dress into a skirt instead because I liked the material, I absolutely LOVE buffalo plaid and the bottom part fit really well. I do feel like I missed out on what could have been a lovely dress because of my bust area. I ordered an XL which is usually what I wear, but this runs small so if you are a true 16/18 woman, this is not for you unless you make alterations as I did. Also, I got the matching purse from a local store so it worked out even more!"
3.0,"The product I received was not peeled.  It was, however, pretty easy to peel and certainly moist and delicious."
3.0,"pretty, but material is see through"
3.0,"This coat came on time, and is nice quality. It was packed well. The blue/purple color is beautiful. The zipper around the neck does show, even though it has a cover. The feathers are coming out after wearing it a few times though, which is disappointing. It is very warm and long. If this review helps you please click helpful underneath. Thank you."
3.0,Colour was a bit off. But it was okay.
3.0,So cute! May want to size up tho!
3.0,I no longer wear these because even though they are comfortably they are a bit large and worse then that the black on the inner legs makes a perfect V right by my V if you know what I mean. It looks very camel toe-ish and is kind of embarrassing.  It might be the size I bought or maybe the way it falls on my body but just be aware.
3.0,"The dress itself is nice,but it was way too small.I ordered x-large and it felt like medium.Unffortunately I will have to send it back."
3.0,I like the mask and how it fits but I was sent the wrong image.
3.0,"Loved the fit, but was less impressed with the quality."
3.0,Still deciding
3.0,"Look great on my son, but not the best of quality."
3.0,Size is perfect. Material is very light and shows every bump and lump underneath on the top. Color is also a nit lighter than the picture.
3.0,Product broke after 3 wears on a 3 year old
3.0,"I really love how dainty this is but not happy with the clasp. It’s not a lobster clasp as pictured it’s one of those circle ones. Had to order a 2nd & place a return cause the 1st one was broke. & even with the adjustable chain, it’s huge. I had to make my jeweler take it in."
3.0,"What's disappointing about these pretty bows is that all of them were placed on the band with a WHITE patch of felt.  Instead of taking the time to get, an inexpensive, piece of felt that matched the flower, the ugly white felt stands out and makes the headband look cheap."
3.0,I gave it three star because the dress arrived today and there was a hole in the arm area butts the dress itself is really pretty. I wish it had the option to share a picture
3.0,"I wish the band was adjustable my wrist is small ,so it doesn't fit on me. It does fit my watch band, and it was easy to put on the watch itself."
3.0,Received the item and everything was good except a couple of the pairs of earrings were missing the metal hooks that you put in your ears.  It was just the leather piece. I ended up having to buy the earring hooks at hobby lobby to fix the earrings.
3.0,Looked a lot better online than what actually showed up. Not sure I'd order anything like that again
3.0,This shirt is very cute! I'm leaving a 3 because the bottom is a little more flares than expected!
3.0,"Overall the quality is really nice, but the length and color are way off. It's much shorter than pictured, which came as a surprise for me as I have a short torso and it was still pretty short. I'd consider it to be above the belt in length, whereas I expected it to fall a few inches longer. Anyways, the color was way off as well. I ordered the olive green color and expected to receive a cardigan that matched the picture. Instead, I got what I would describe as a forest green (much like the Kelly green shown in the color options for this product) - far more vibrant than what the picture shows for olive green. The product was labelled accordingly, but like I said, the color represented in the picture did not match what I received. Due to the inconsistency, I was unable to wear it as planned for professional pictures. However, it'll be perfect for Christmas pictures when the day comes. So just fair warning, the olive green isn't olive green."
3.0,"The fabric felt much like a potato sack, but sizing was true to size."
3.0,They work. There light weight. Nothing special about them really
3.0,Good.  Gets the job done.
3.0,Muy grande pero me gusta
3.0,Comfortable. Runs a bit big but that's just fine!
3.0,It’s short and wide.  Buy with caution
3.0,Beautiful ....
3.0,"Loved the shirt, but the sleeves are much shorter than they appeared."
3.0,Hat is small for me.  It feel like it would be warm.  I did notice that the fur seemed to pull out.
3.0,"Adorable leather shoes, however, as a gift, I had expected to present them in a charming box with ribbon-not a plastic  pouch. Will keep them to give at anther time, but not a shower"
3.0,"The fabric doesn't ""hold"" - so every little jiggle shows - especially true for the bottom.  Returned it, even though my 17 year old loved the cosplay aspect of it.  She agreed she would be too self conscious and uncomfortable."
3.0,These are ankle socks.<br /><br />While they are comfortable and okay thickness they are not crew socks as pictured.
3.0,Supposed to be for a man but you sent me one for a woman other than that it’s fine. I got it for my fiancé for Christmas and he ended up sending it to me because it wasn’t big enough.
3.0,Runs somewhat small.
3.0,The shirt was a little too small and I got mine in white which is pretty see-through
3.0,Order two sizes larger than you need. And be ready to wait cause this ships from China.
3.0,"I got sucked into buying these off a recommendation from a blogger (as “Lululemon dupes”). While the fabric is very soft, they don’t suck you in like traditional leggings and they slide down (I got a small). They also look slightly “pilled” after just one wear. Wouldn’t recommend."
3.0,I loved this tee so much but when it arrived the fit and the cut was really unflattering. Cut more like a man's tee than a woman's so I had to return. Shame as the design on the front was fun and was overall a good quality item. Just hated how it looked on.
3.0,"not exactly what I was hoping for, but not bad. would buy again....maybe just needed a smaller size. Was REALLY long, though."
3.0,Material is a little cheap but overall not see through and pretty! Actually liked in better on with the neckline normal than off the shoulder; would've never stayed well in the off shoulder position.
3.0,"Its nothing fancy but it's for a teenage boy, so he should like it ok."
3.0,Color and quality were good but just way too small and I do not have a large head.
3.0,thought it would be bigger.  Wish these products would have a measuring guide associated with the ad.
3.0,It falls off of my shoulders. I don't like the material. It's too chincy to return so I am donating it.
3.0,Very see through. Couldn’t wear it.
3.0,"Got the tie back I'm white and had to order another- the racerback cut is much smaller in the chest, and shorter. I'm between a med and large (wear a 34b) - and the large was tight on my chest and too high of a neck to be very flattering. Stick to the tie back style."
3.0,Good for a bit but the gold turns copper pretty quickly
3.0,Kind of tacky looking.
3.0,Not as brilliant/sparkly as pictured
3.0,It is a little too short for my taste but other than it fits well.
3.0,"Obbsessed with these. Only thing is, take care of them and will last longer"
3.0,"These NIMIN high waist cropped lounge jogger sweatpants are okay. It isn’t really something I care for much.<br /><br />For reference, I have 5’6”, about 145 lbs right now, wear size 6-8 pants and ordered a size large which is comfortable.<br /><br />-Black medium thickness fabric (towards the thinner side)<br />-Fabric is pretty soft and also stretchy<br />-Comfortable fit-somewhat form fitting around my bottom, but not completely skin tight, relaxed semi-loose fit elsewhere.<br />-The cuffs comes down a bit below mid-calf for me. They don’t appear to be very fitted unless I slide them up a bit.<br />-High waisted with elastic band at waist<br />-Fabric tie that goes through belt loops around your waist<br />-Fabric doesn’t seem that high quality. It feels like something I would only wear around the house, yet the tie suggests to me that it is meant to be worn out.<br />-I have only worn around the house to test without even washing yet, and the fabric has already started pilling a little bit. It isn’t excessive yet, but I have another pair of pants with similar fabric from this same brand and it pilled so excessively<br /><br />Overall, I like these for comfy pants to wear around the house, but I wouldn’t wear them out. They seem like lounge pants only. The tie around the waist and belt loops is unnecessary to me. I think the company should rethink this fabric due to the pilling that I have experienced with another pair of their pants and now these. This fabric just doesn’t look like something to wear out.<br /><br />These also aren’t my favorite lounge pants by them. I have two other jogger style lounge pants by this brand that I really like. They both use a similar fabric that is so soft and different form this fabric. Interestingly enough, those pants are both smalls and one is very fitted but completely comfortable and the other feels slightly tight around the waist band.<br /><br />Overall, I don’t hate these pants, but I don’t love them either. I will continue to wear them around the house as they are comfortble. They don’t look bad, but not good enough to wear out of the house opinion.<br /><br />I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!!!!"
3.0,The scarf is nice-just not my style.
3.0,"Fun designs but I have difficulty keeping them up - small face: when I showed up at my doctor’s office, they said it was not heavy enough to do any good and they handed me a pleated cotton mask. Now when I wear this for protection, I double the fabric and that helps a bit with keeping it up. I ordered several sets thinking they were good for COVID but evidently not - however I see lots of people, mostly men (larger heads) wearing them for COVID requirements.  I wouldn’t have known they aren’t protective had I not worn it to my doctor appointment. Two pros - they double as a fashion accessory and its right there when you need it - just pull it up (doubled).<br />So 3 stars not 5."
3.0,These are tiny beds.. not pearls. I returned.
3.0,Cheap looking. Gave to niece to play with.
3.0,"Ligero,facil de colocar el producto. el vendedor me envio 2 pulseras de mismo color."
3.0,Good price but was disappointed the material of the dress seemed to be made with cheaper material.<br />Good for a night on the town in low light setting. No one would see the details of the dress.
3.0,"It is cut odd and very thin. good for summer,"
3.0,Cute but yoo heavy to wear for more than 5 minutes
3.0,Skirt fit as expected but the top was so tiny my size 4 friend got to take it home. It’s an XXL in Middle Earth but not in reality
3.0,its too small for me to wear but maybe some day soon i will fit it<br />its very cute
3.0,The design of this wallet is cool but it isn't very thick and doesn't hold all of my student id cards/drivers license/ credit cards/ etc....<br />I won't be using it very much.
3.0,"These are alright.  They fit decently, although the wrist part is floppy.  I wish they were a little tighter.  These are nothing more than backup gloves for me."
3.0,"Only used a few of the items but they worked out well; take kept riding up but otherwise, good quality"
3.0,Material is a bit heavy.
3.0,nice material.<br />5’7” & 185lbs / 8wks postpartum.<br />XXL was way too small ...bummed i had to return.
3.0,Pretty but fell right off my wrists and I lost them in a week.  Not pliable enought.
3.0,The skirt is translucent
3.0,Bust area is very big for ladies with C cup or bigger. Very see through.
3.0,I ordered this in three other colors. The gray is a different material. Not as silky
3.0,"The dress is thin. I used it to wear for a Halloween costume as Winnie the Pooh. It worked for the couple times i needed it, otherwise, I don’t think I would use it as a daily dress."
3.0,"The fit was perfect on the XXL for a 5’5” person/195lbs.  The material looks good & is stretch & comfy, but breaks down within two to three washings.  They started to pill(get the little fuzzy balls) up after the first wash.  If I had know these things I wouldn’t have purchased them."
3.0,"It’s cute for pictures and the idea of it. However, there’s really nothing to hold it, I wanted it to be like a textbook cover. The entire time at the airport, security had to keep taking my passport out of it. It’s just got decoration."
3.0,"I got two of them, one fits fine the other is a large, the size states med but it fits my wife and she has a hat size of large, thus I would say that the label was wrong or QA issue in making the hat sizes consistence.  Looks more like the label than anything else, but this is also a QA issue.<br /><br />So one fits fine the other is to large, gave it to may wife."
3.0,"Light weight is exactly what i want, but the stitches... just poorly made."
3.0,Very difficult to open & close latch & easily bends. Other then that are beautiful earrings. Unfortunately didn't last but a few months.
3.0,"Too slouchy for me, too hard to find things inside."
3.0,"The material is cheap, doesn't look horrible once it is on but lower quality.  I also can't button the top button, the buttonhole forces the collar to overlap itself.  I still liked the look of the shirt so I will still wear it, considering the cost it was a good buy."
3.0,I really thought these were going to be cute they were very comfortable but they will not stand up you have to wear them folded over with the fur or they look for me because they just slow down I found something else I like to better and I'll return them but they were comfortable
3.0,A good pant for the price.
3.0,"The dress was beautiful, but the sizes were limited! I was terrible disappointed because I really wanted to finally wear an African print on our cruise!"
3.0,Uppers seems to be made from short life material. Sole seems to be made to last longer.<br />Looks decent expected a little better quality for price
3.0,"Bought it for my 19 year old who is away at college in upstate NY. He has a slim, lanky build but is also muscular and he said this was way too small."
3.0,"I loved this little dress so much, but it was way too short and the sleeves did not fit me as they did on the model.  I am 5'8"" and a true size 4 and I ordered a size small but unfortunately, the arm holes were extremely tight and sleeves were shorter than photographed. The hem length fell just below my underwear, making it impossible to sit without shorts or pants on.  Bummed that I had to send it back!"
3.0,This was great for one night the straps on the top broke off I can still use it tho and the bottoms are see thru
3.0,Was a lil too big but I wore it any ways.<br />The tag line make the wearing worth it<br />#faithOverFear I got a medium. Am 5/6 & 165lb
3.0,It fit my daughter better than myself but nice quality.
3.0,"I love this choker but it broke only a little while after I got it. I ghetto fixed it up so I can still manage to wear it, but it's still broken...<br />Otherwise it's perfectly fine and it goes well with lots of different outfits"
3.0,It was about two sizes smaller than I was expecting.
3.0,"A little large for me, but I can work it out.  Thanks!"
3.0,"Fabric feels a little cheap and flimsy and colors (I orderd 3 different colors) are less vibrant than I would wish.  I have lost a lot of weight and the 3X V-necks I have are sliding off my shoulders, so needed to order a few inexpensive ones in a smaller size.  I have owned other tops from Woman Within and these are the first ones whose fabric and colors have disappointed me.  I haven't washed them yet (have only worn 2 of the 3 one time) so don't know how they will hold up after repeated washings and dryings.  My guess is not very well given the quality of the fabric they are made from."
3.0,"These are cute, but some of them were displaced when they arrived.  I was a bit disappointed in this since they were a gift, but my niece didn't seem to care.  ;)"
3.0,Sleeve ripedoped after wearing one time. Ordered one for my sister and hers ripped at the sleeve too.
3.0,The arm part didn’t fit it doesn’t stretch
3.0,Wish I would have ordered 1 size bigger it does not fit even with laces all out
3.0,"That has a 14k gold fill, making it look shiny and a bit more expensive. With copper being the base metal, I can expect that in time, the copper will cause the jewelry to turn green. If you are one of those that has an issue with plated material, this will probably not work well for you."
3.0,"Is cute, is a bit larger than the original watch bad so had to squeeze it in. Is hard to get a comfortable fit around my wrist(either too loose or too tight)."
3.0,Absolutely love the color and style but the zipper came busted so I was pretty bummed about that.
3.0,Used this product for cheer camp and it fits as expected.
3.0,It’s cute and light. You forget it’s there... but it gets stuck on stuff sometimes and that causes the charms to fall off.
3.0,Pero podria ser mejor el material es literalmente carton forrado
3.0,You pay for the logo.<br />You can buy a black long sleeve shirt for $7.99
3.0,"The leggings looks good but with no enough stretch and little bit small than expected, so disappointed!"
3.0,"Loved this shirt with the cats;  however, the graphic was ironed on and in the process the edges of the pocket were turning up and was very noticeable.  Too bad.  Otherwise cute.  Fabric is heavy, not a light cotton for summer!"
3.0,"It took a month to get here I thought it might have been lost. The scarf texture is silky smooth & soft light on my head to wear to bed, there was a tear/hole in the scarf though, its very fragile but the only light weight scarf that don't give me a headache."
3.0,Give the right size
3.0,"There's extra Velcro tabs on the inside of band to remove face of watch from band.  I think this is stupid for little kids they will lose the separate pieces.  but my son loves TRex, it looks like it would fit even for toddlers wrists if tightened entirely, which is nice for littler ones.  Looks exactly like the picture."
3.0,"Honestly,  looks really cool,  thought it'd be good for a masquerade party I will be attending.  Came in folded,  painful to wear and worst of all,  the mesh was undone from the mask.  I am doing my best to glue the mesh back on atm.  After I keep the mask unfolded for a while it will most likely be easier to wear but the mesh coming off right out of the box is a real killer."
3.0,"Good to use for an hour or two but cant keep on for long. Most of all when it comes, keep it front of table fan to get all toxic smell out of it.  (although you will still smell it a bit). The material of mask was as expected and i was careful not to get any scratch or cut. Visibility through the mask is limited, so be careful while walking."
3.0,Quite cheap looking but it's from China..
3.0,"This shirt is really cute but seems VERY short, but other than that i like it"
3.0,"The shoe looks to be well-made for the price but it does not run true to size. There are three places where width comes into play: at the toe-box, at the arch/instep, and at the heel.  The toe-box and heel on this shoe run true to size. The strap over the arch, however, should be called a Narrow, not a Medium.  Although the toe-box is spacious and could even be designated a Wide (the elastic laces are for making the wide toe-box tighter), the strap that goes over the instep has almost no stretch to it; the shoe is a Narrow there.  I do have a high arch, but my usual complaint is that a shoe of Normal width pinches or is too tight on the instep.  I could not get these shoes onto my foot."
3.0,"Love the way everything matches. I’m one of those people that like for things to match. The choker, however, sits kind of high on my neck. I didn’t expect that. I thought it would lay flat at the neck. I guess I just have a fat neck. Lol!!"
3.0,The shirt I ordered was the one in the picture which looks like black with white trim even though the choice said grey under that picture. I did get a grey shirt but the trim is grey too. So instead of black and white I got grey and grey. Wish they would of had the right shirts listed with the picture. XL seems  more like  2X. I wear a large but like certain shirts a little larger and this was way to large.
3.0,Runs really small but thr quality of the fabric was nice just had to buy 3 sizes bigger.
3.0,"U.S. XXL is medium in China size.  Loved these shirts, but shipping them back for larger size was costly."
3.0,Muy lindo top pero corre muy pequeño
3.0,"Super cute, roomy apron. I love the colors and it fits my plus size figure. The fabric is nice— not too thick or heavy. The only problem with it is that the print is upside down!! In the picture the horses are standing upright but in the actual apron- or, at least on mine, the horses are facing down. Not a big deal but weird."
3.0,"The watch is actually pretty nice for the price - great for kids.  However, the instructions suck.  First, they are obtuse.  Second, you need a magnifier to read them.  Third, and more important, they are for another watch.<br /><br />I almost sent it back, when I discovered that I really could set the watch by trial and error.  Here's what I included with it when we gave it to our grandson:<br /><br />The instructions sent with the watch were for some other watch.  I think I figured out how to work it.<br /><br />There are 3 buttons on the watch: Mode, Reset, and Start. (There is a fourth button, Light, which turns on the flashlight - use sparingly).<br /><br />The Mode button cycles you through display of the TIME, DATE, ALARM  (AL on the display), DUAL TIME (DL) and STOPWATCH (ST) functions.<br /><br />To reset. cycle through to the function you want to reset.<br /><br />TIME/DATE/DUAL TIME: press Start or Reset for 3 seconds, then press Reset again but just for 1 second. The number to be adjusted will blink. By pressing Mode, the number will increase by one.  If you hold Mode in, the numbers will increase rapidly. When you have the correct number, press Reset again to go to the next (E.G. - to go from hours to minutes).  Once set, press Start or Reset to move to the next setting.  Note:  when you're in 12 hour mode, there is a very small &#34;p&#34; to the left of the hours to indicate pm.<br /><br />When in Time or Dual Time = after the time is set, either a 12H or 24H will blink, indicating it is in 12 or 24 hour mode.  To change it, hold the Mode key for a couple of seconds.  To exit, press Reset.<br /><br />ALARM: press Start or Reset for 3 seconds.  Mode changes hours.  Press Mode to get to minutes. Then alarm on/off blinks.  Press and hold Mode to turn alarm on or off. To exit, press Mode.<br /><br />STOPWATCH. Press and hold Start to set the timer to zero.  press Start to start timer, and again to stop it.<br /><br />To ser the analog watch, pull the stem out and turn it.  When done, push the stem in."
3.0,"All kids shoes take a beating, but these look months old after only a few weeks."
3.0,"I ordered this a size up and fits fine, but is not oversized like the picture and the sleeves are short.You need to order at least two sizes up if you want it to look like the picture. I also didn’t realize it has side slits -not really my style. It’s also the cheep polyester material. It’s comfortable enough and the print is cute."
3.0,"I loved this bag when I got it. Beautiful and roomy.  But within 2 months, one of the outside zippers broke, and now, 3 months after purchasing it, the color is wearing off the drawstrings.  So, looks good, but not impressed with the quality."
3.0,Made of plastic<br />100 % polarized glasses<br />Its good for beach but not for long term<br />Susceptible to easy wear and tear
3.0,Go up at least one if not two sizes.  I am a 36D and my bust does not fit in an XL.
3.0,"The jacket fits okay, I just was unsatisfied with the material it was made with, but other than that it is all good. It was worth the price."
3.0,"I really like this skirt it fits great and is comfy although mine was not faux suede like the title says, however I still really like the skirt"
3.0,"Some of the items were broken (the valves),and the one's that weren't didn't feel comfortable. No instructions, so I didn't feel comfortable going out with them on because I wasn't sure I was protected. I thought I was getting a good product spending the extra money."
3.0,Ajusta bien.
3.0,"I purchased these shirts to add iron on vinyl, hoping they would be soft, unfortunately they aren’t. Too bad, they seem sturdy and well made just not soft at all."
3.0,"Not bad , and I would wear it , but not worth the price and the picture is slightly missleading."
3.0,Not crazy about it. It's okay not great.
3.0,"Very cute dress. However, I could not get the wrinkles out of it. Went to iron it, and it began to melt!"
3.0,"This was an inexpensive dress, so I guess I should have expected the material to be thin. If you are particular about the way the stripes run on an article of clothing, you may want to steer clear of this dress. The stripes across the bodice were not sewn straight, and the stripes in the skirt lay at a slight angle. The hem lays shorter than I expected, and I am a short girl.<br />The dress itself fit as expected and the waistline came to my waist.<br />Overall, it is not a bad dress for running around town in, as it is very comfortable."
3.0,Fit well- size was a 9 and daughter is a 9.5 but they worked.
3.0,"This isn’t awful, just a little thin for my liking. Definitely looks different in person than on the model. And the string belt really is just that, a shoestring."
3.0,Very pretty. Will go with many things. Received a discount to review this product
3.0,The finger end that is to work with a smart phone doesn't work.
3.0,really pretty but the white is really see through! i wouldn't order the white again.
3.0,"beautifully made, just a bit on the small side. would order 2 sizes up to get a good fit."
3.0,"I received a great looking belt and seems to be just like the picture however my belt had the tags of some brand called doulilu on it (not Itzor).  I also am a little disappointed with the box.  My box was just a generic cardboard box, didn't look anything like the photo or any other kind of gift box.  No instructions came in the package either so its a lucky thing that amazon provided instructions on the purchase page.  Overall not a bad belt for less than 15 bucks but will see how it holds up with time."
3.0,"Odd material and didn't lay quite right.  Kept, but gave away."
3.0,Its too big for a toddler. Pretty much fits me better than my kid.
3.0,Bought this and love it. A little bigger than I wanted but oh well.
3.0,Came ripped and I forgot to return. Could be cute just requires some work which isn’t worth it
3.0,"…nice fabric and seemingly well made, but super large. Didn’t work for me at all."
3.0,This is an interesting design. I Like it.Go 2 sizes larger than you normally where and you should be fine.
3.0,"Nice quality but didnt look good on me. I wear a 12-14 and got an XL based on reviews. Even with spanx, it looked too tight on me for my tastes"
3.0,NEVER place in dryer it will shrink. Air dry only. Other than that the embroidery was really nice and it fit well before I washed it.
3.0,"Feels and looks a little cheap. The vinyl lettering bunches funny, and sticks to itself when dried."
3.0,"Nice shirt and fit great before washing it.....After a wash and one spin in the dryer and it shrunk considerably, now my fits too small for my son, but sometimes he still wears it around the house or to sleep in."
3.0,"[ usually wear size X leg or Xx leg because I have  long arms and a little belly to hide! Unfortunately this shirt materiel is stiff and frumpy. I give it 3 stars because I like the cut and color. Hopefully after it's washed several times it'll loosen up,oh I ordered an Xlrg and the sleeves were also a little short."
3.0,The costume was very large even after using the size chart...I had to have it taken in to even look good.
3.0,The actual mitten is too short and too wide. It doesn't fit the hand very well.
3.0,Shirt is nice but the sizes run small
3.0,Love the soft silk material. The print was excellent too.
3.0,Did not lat long
3.0,"My daughter loves this necklace, she wears it everyday!"
3.0,"It’s really cute, but the marital wrinkles too much."
3.0,Esta bien quedo bien solo hay que saber conocer el la talla
3.0,"Love this watch. It's comfortable and cute. The only problem is that within a week the side button fell off and keeps falling off.  Super glue may keep the outer ring in place so the the inner button is still free to move and show the time/date, but that's a bit of a hassle. No button, no time!  Looks great; durability needs work."
3.0,Looks very tight i'm xl. Fabric looks and feels comfy. Will see. Update picture soon
3.0,"09/28/18<br />I've only had this for a week, it looks good, it seems well constructed except for the breakaway connection, after wearing it for about 3 days it just fell off my neck while I was walking, luckily I was aware of it at the time. The plastic tab doesn't really click when connected. I've been able to correct the issue, I will keep it. I do think it needs to be addressed. Other than that, I color and print are good.<br />USMC"
3.0,"The purpose of this band was for me to be able to wear it to the gym or when working out to keep my wrist from sweating. While it serves this purpose, the band does not stay centered on my wrist unless I tighten it really tight. The material is too thin to hold the watch. The picture is deceptive."
3.0,I just received it today and the earings were useless  the backing was broke. The rest seems ok but disappointed  of how fast it broke
3.0,Looks soo beautiful love it fits amazing and looks amazing too and the price makes it better!
3.0,"I was really excited to get this sweater, it’s super cute. Sadly, it’s not like the picture, all roomy and loose and long. The top part with the sleeves and the pearly beads fit like the size it is, that is except for the neck hole. That is very small. I could hardly get it over my head and it doesn’t stretch. Plus, it’s narrow at the bottom of the sweater and too short not long at all, not as in the picture."
3.0,I have purchased four pairs of these — all in the same size. But only one fit. The others were too small.
3.0,The dress was very pretty. Alittle large across the shoulders. Had a very odd smell when I opened the package. Thought it was the packaging but never went away. Didn't like the foot enough to wash it to see if it would go away.
3.0,I bought it thinking it is flexible and soft like stuffed toy.  But it is solid and little heavy.  Anyway I am still using it :(
3.0,"This is supposed to be a 3XL, but there is no tag inside the shirt.  It's too small to even go around my body, let alone to try and button it.  The shirt itself looks nice, but I'll never know how it feels or wears."
3.0,"I was really looking forward to wearing this dress, because they sizing charts said it was a long dress .... well the measurements are wrong! I am 5'10 and trying to find a long dress is hard so I went along the size chart, the dress ended up being to small. It says it goes to the ground but it goes to my ankle instead. I ordered a medium, go a size up!!!"
3.0,"Runs a size smaller than expected,and very thin but good quality."
3.0,There's no stretch to this dress. I was hoping I can squeeze myself into it. It didn't happen lol. It's an ok shade of pink.
3.0,For the price this watch is a nice keepsake item.  I don't recommend it for wear bc I cannot see it holding up under daily wear.  I did purchase this for my son and the engraving in the back is tough to read but he loved the inscription.  I would recommend this for someone in high school age.  Great if you just want to hold it to pass down.  He currently keeps it in the box.
3.0,"Regetta Jewelry's Leather Rope Multi-Strand Bracelet is unique.  I don't necessarily believe this bracelet is unisex as there are a few flaws for both sexes.<br /><br />When my wife wore the bracelet, the tightest setting is still too loose.  The strands do not lie in a natural manner and she often found the charms on the underside of her wrist, which is not the purpose of wearing a bracelet with designs.  When I wore the bracelet, it actually fit me great, but the strands still found their way to the underside of my wrist and one of them actually broke off.<br /><br />While I think it looks cool, when I put it on it has a different vibe for me.  I wish the way it was put together was a bit more precise and tighter.  I can appreciate things that are made by hand, as long as it's quality and I truly think there is some room for improvement here.  I think the price is a bit steep as well.  I like wearing unique things, especially if it is something with leather and it's unique, like this bracelet, but it fell short on execution for me.<br /><br />I purchased Regetta Jewelry's Leather Rope Multi-Strand Bracelet at a discount in exchange for wearing and reviewing with an unbiased approach, thus my review reflects my personal experience and opinion."
3.0,This top fits nicely and is not sheer at all. It did feel a little itchy at first but I think that was because it’s not a blend that I am used to.
3.0,"They're ok, but they are somewhat large and not cute at all"
3.0,I really like them so far all be it the first day. However I wished the lenses were blue like discribed.
3.0,Okay but a little small. Becomes uncomfortable quickly. Like the filter insert
3.0,It’s very similar to the picture but pieces were broken off when I opened the box and had to repair it and the nose piece is also quite narrow but widens quite easily. The broken pieces were mostly on the side of the mask and a few pieces above the eye. Went well as a steampunk cosplay though.
3.0,"Arrived on time. They are as pictured and were true to size. My little one loved them, but we pretty much got what we paid for, I guess. The second time they were worn, one of the bows just ripped off... looks like they were just glued on, so I plan on glueing it back, just dissappointing...I think a simple stitch would make them more sturdy."
3.0,The overall quality of build looks pretty good. Previous reviews about poor quality materials seem to have been addressed. Its a good garment. If you are heavier its going to fit more generous. I typically need a 2XL to cover length because of long torso. I think in the future with these Hilton shirts I'd just go with a standard XL.
3.0,The top ends where my boobs start. The shorts are awesome though.
3.0,Very cheaply made. Doesn't seem like picture
3.0,Good but to small
3.0,Its great for a stylish but very comfortable wrap.
3.0,It's kind of difficult to steam/iron. It seems to make the wrinkles or creases worse. But the style still looks cool.
3.0,Runs really small!
3.0,This is a great dress but it is hugggggeeee! What ever size you normally wear buy a size smaller! Otherwise great dress !
3.0,Super cute top. It runs very small though
3.0,"Like other reviewers pointed out, the buttons are barely sewn on. 1 fell off within an hour. The patches at the top are cute but obviously ironed on and are folding back at the edges. The dress is cute and cut well and I plan to replace all the buttons as well as sew the patches so I’m keeping. IF you’re ok with putting work into the dress I recommend because the style is great. Otherwise pass on this one."
3.0,I bought this for my HD Iron. New rider at 40th.<br />I went to Miami to bring this product to my country but the CO2 Cartridge can not be carried by airline.<br />I'm still looking locally. No luck so far.
3.0,JuSt not for me
3.0,Cute top but runs small. I ended up returning it.
3.0,"Such long sleeve shirts always make me feeling comfortable and cozy whenever I am.<br />This one is cute and doesn't look cheap, but still I target's long sleeve sweaters fit me better.<br />I'm not supertall, but I'd prefer it to be a little longer. In terms of width, S is perfect for me, a little bit bigger than I need, I usually wear American XS."
3.0,"Really cute, too small"
3.0,the medium was tight and i returned it for a large.
3.0,The valve could work a little better. The thing that urks me the most is the ear loops. I wish it was more elastic or flexible. Barely stretching and is too tight.
3.0,Nice Colors
3.0,They where nice but not true to size they ran small
3.0,I love them and they're super cute! The only reason I gave a 3 is because one boot felt a little bit tighter on my calf than they other.
3.0,"Very pretty skirt. The elastic was not sewn in, however, and it twisted a bit upon wearing."
3.0,"The fabric was very thin and snagged very easy. But for the price, its not horrible."
3.0,i like the look of the earrings but the part that goes in your ear is off to one side instead of centered and i wish i would have known that... but they are super cute and they don't irritate my ears
3.0,Smells bad;(....but fits well!
3.0,"So I ordered a 3XL. Felt like I was wearing baby clothing though. It fits super, super ... super tight. They need to have an easily identifiable disclaimer about products that are made in USA vs. Overseas. I realize if we want to take 5 min to scroll through all the small/fine print we can probably find out. This clothing will make you feel like you shopped at baby-gap though."
3.0,Size fine but too short for a 6 footer
3.0,A little wide for my face. Other than that their nice.
3.0,did no fit
3.0,Se le sale el lazo desde la primera usada. No está bien fijado.
3.0,"Cute, but fit small than actual size"
3.0,It is Ok for the price and I think it is leather.  But if you have a lot you want to put in this wallet it is too small.
3.0,Cute jeans but they run bigger than expected. Teen wears a size 14 normally but looks like he needs a 10 in these. I will return and reorder.
3.0,The color doesn't even look close to the color pictured. Luckily my son still likes them (he picked the color). I followed the size chart and they are quite large but he'll grow into them. They seem like nice shoes but the color and size discrepancy is disappointing.
3.0,Yellow was so light they just didn't look good.  The glasses are nice but get a different color  !
3.0,This is a stylish looking suit and I loved the design. Unfortunately it ran pretty small and the quality was only ok.
3.0,"I just didn't like the fit, they looked too grandma-ish. I ordered a large, I'm 5'1"", size 8-10 and 38C. The top was loose but the bottom was perfect. If I ordered a medium, it would have been too small. I ended up returning both swim suits."
3.0,the size is small almost for a teen even if it says men even ordered a larger size up. it still didnt fit. way small for me. also the material is just ok thought it would be something like target or khols level but more of kmart.
3.0,It was ok for the price!
3.0,Event was canceled due to Covid
3.0,97.6% cotton<br />2.4% spandex
3.0,"Smaller than I thought, and the metal is a little flimsy, but I think it will withstand quite a bit with the dome of apoxy(?) covering it."
3.0,Way too short for my long torso.  It barely covers my vagina... So no: I won't be wearing this.<br />Would only recommend for really short women or people with almost no torso... or anyone that wants to publicly display your cooter to the anyone with working eyes.
3.0,the lace breaks down with loose threading after the first wash
3.0,Very cute but a lil thin.
3.0,Nice looking. Too small.
3.0,"I bought this to use as a rinse out conditioner and didn't realize until I received it that it's actually more of a moisturizer. It's supposed to detangle curly hair. I actually have no use for this product because I don't have a need for a leave-in detangler right now. If I wanted a leave in detangler I would purchase Kinky Curly's Knot Today, which I think is the best product of its kind. I don't think I will be trying any other products from Soultanicals at the moment. I'm trying different products because Aubrey Organics was sold to a company in the U.K. and there is no word yet or whether they will continue to make the J.A.Y. Conditioner. It says on the bottle that it can be used as a rinse out conditioner but I tried to use it that way and it did not condition my hair. I have 4B hair and I need a good thick conditioner that will detangle and moisturize. It smells ok but did nothing for my hair. They also have a product called Knot Sauce that's described as a leave-in detangler. Anyhow, I'm still looking for a new conditioner."
3.0,Little scratches on the lens but you get what you pay for..
3.0,"Buy 3-4 sizes higher!  The length is much shorter than appears in photo. I was disappointed to find the white print isn't on the backside also, which would have been a much cooler effect. Oh well, I will wear it anyway.Happy Halloween!"
3.0,Hard to slide foot in at first but seem to loosen out.
3.0,hopefully itll stretch somewhat because the size 9 fit to snug but im not sure if I can exchange for a larger size. but it is a nice cute shoe.
3.0,Nice hat... But diiscription is wrong. It is not packable. Sending back!
3.0,"Love the soft lightweight material and graphic, but it was advertised as a Men's size and when I received it, it was obviously kids size. Wish there was an adult size equivalent. Return was easy though."
3.0,"Very stretchy so they tend to slide down. You will be constantly pulling them up. And even when you think they sit well on your hips, give it a minute and they will be hanging at your crotch.<br />Also pretty short. They are not short enough to be capris but not long enough to be pants. I had to roll them up or they just looked weird.<br /><br />The only good thing- Perfect for summer. Wear them when its 90 out and you won't sweat in them."
3.0,Quality of the neoprene not that great.
3.0,Way tooooooo small
3.0,This is the second set that I have purchase and both came with this horrible smell. My hat with this set the strings were coming out of it.
3.0,"The ruffle in the sleeve is achieved with some thin plastic string. It goes down into the bodice. This poked out and itches my daughter. It is not a slim fit, which wasn’t a plus in this case."
3.0,"Very pretty dress, but size runs small.  I'm usually a 2-4, and the small was too small.  Dress is not as pictured,  The skirt is tiered, but no ruffles as in the picture.  Not easy to return, must be returned in a certain time frame, pay for shipping and a $10/restocking fee.  I ended up giving to a friend, because it was going to cost $20+ to return it - not worth the effort."
3.0,"Love the shirt, but too small... I hope my weight loss program is going to work..."
3.0,"Velcro has two sides -- the fuzzy one and the spiky one. This hat arrived with just the fuzzy velcro, but nowhere to attach it to. I found some and hot glued it on, so I would be able to wear this.<br />The hat works well with a pony tail and keeps sun out of my face. It's not the most secure, but I tied a scarf around the top at times to make sure it wouldn't fly off when I was riding my bike.<br />It's pretty functional overall and I like that it rolls up and secures with a small elastic loop."
3.0,The earrings are cute but super noisy. They drove me crazy all day!
3.0,"I like that these bags claim to hold up to 40 pounds. The handles are long, maybe a little too long, but that's not a big deal for me. I didn't think of measuring width the bags these were going to replace, which is how I ended up with smaller one's. These are tall enough, just not wide enough to allow most items to sit flat. For now, they'll work, but at some point I will have to find wider ones."
3.0,Easy to use and reasonably priced.
3.0,"nice glove, but large red patches on both gloves detracts from the look<br />back of glove is nice and warm, but palm has no insulation"
3.0,The clasp comes undone could use improvement and it would be great
3.0,It’s looks cute but definitely looks cheap. One of the charms was put on backwards which is very annoying.
3.0,Runs a little on the small size<br />Not to comfortable<br />But love the colors
3.0,these are beautiful!  I thought they were bigger so I was getting them for my oldest daughter but they are perfect size for my 3 year old.  they are a little smaller than a dime
3.0,"Strange curve to them that feels weird, but I love how they look.  If they felt different wearing them I'd wear more often."
3.0,Middle of the road quality
3.0,Did not like front pockets do not hold phone.
3.0,Get a slip it’s see threw! 😩
3.0,Liked the shoe to wide & long
3.0,If you are a dd a d normally wear a large  I recommend getting the xlarge for room in busy area.  I returned the large too tight in chest. Otherwise it fit great.
3.0,"The color looks reddish in the picture but it is brown.  Also, thought it was more animal print on the outer edges, but it is rhinestone.  Not quite what I thought it would be."
3.0,The top runs small.
3.0,Bought this to wear around the house. The top has a boat neck so it's big and I'm constantly adjusting it. The torso and sleeves fit like a M. The bottoms fit like an XL.
3.0,Not great quality but decent value
3.0,"This is a very good quality belt, but I really had no idea what it was going to be like. This thing is WIDE and it's THICK. In fact, it's too wide and too thick. I can barely get it through my belt loops, and it's so thick & stiff, it digs into my hip bones when I sit down. Unfortunately, I missed to return window by TWO days...  So be very sure this is what you want before you buy it."
3.0,"They are saying this runs true to size, maybe in china where sizes seem to be different. If you have much of a package especially, it will be small. Order one size larger."
3.0,"I bought this for my Dad.  He wanted a green fedora and this pretty much filled the bill.  But the hat is on the light side. Almost flimsy.  I bought him a couple of other fedoras which were heavier and held their shape no matter which way you held them. this collapses at certain angles.  Once on the head you have to sort of shape it, unlike the others which just needed to be dipped at the classical &#34;jaunty&#34; angle."
3.0,Wore 3 times and RIPPPPP.... So yeah they dont hold up to well.
3.0,"I have other thumbhole arm sleeves from Allegra and those are much better quality, these are thinner and not reinforces as well as their other sleeves. Lots of stray strings on these and they were very thin. I'd skip these and get a different pair, but if you need some thin and plain ones these are acceptable...just don't expect them to last a long time."
3.0,"I loved the pillow cover pattern.  However, I ordered 2 and one looks more 'worn' than the other like it was printed on a canvas material and the other was printed on a cotton.  I put them on either ends of the couch so hopefully no one will notice but me.  Just a little disappointing considering how much they were."
3.0,I wore these boots to work twice & each day my feet were soak and wet. They are comfortable just definitely not waterproof 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
3.0,"Color and fit as expected (5'5&#34; 145 lbs)..  Fabric feels soft. Very see through making it unsuitable as a summer dress, but ok to wear with leggings or as cover up on beach."
3.0,Didn't realize the belt was stretchy 🤷
3.0,Was very disappointed in the quality. Looked like something I could have made myself and I can’t sew to save my life. Does not hang off the shoulder like in the pic. Was very tight. Definitely buy a few sizes bigger. Especially if you want it to to be baggy.
3.0,"Even though this isn't good quality, it's still a nice belt.  The leather is soft but not supple.  The edges are slightly rough and aren't very comfortable unless your shirt is tucked in.  The buckle is great and looks kind of rugged.  The color of the belt is rich and the finish is smooth.  If you aren't someone who will wear this belt often, or if you're cool with repurchasing it sooner rather than later because it's showing signs of wear, then this is a great belt for you."
3.0,UPDATE:  Revant customer service is outstanding and has exchanged my lenses.  I will update with how they hold up!<br /><br />Garbage.  6 weeks into putting these lenses into my Batwolf Oakley frames there is a sort of corrosion and discoloration on immediate edges of the lens.  My last Oakley lens lasted 12+ months
3.0,Very small with a cheap fabric
3.0,"If you have a tiny wrist, skip this one.  It's attractive and seems durable, but it almost the long band doubled over, added heft and looked ridiculous.  Small boned people should stick with bands that can be cut down to size."
3.0,"Plenty of gold and silver but didn't notice any platinum,  I looked up what it should look like online but still didn't see any . So pictures of what I should be looking for would be great"
3.0,"Great cheap pair of shades, bought them for my boyfriend. He's a roofer, so he likes how dark they are for work, however, they're almost TOO dark. He cannot wear them when driving.."
3.0,The materials used are of decent quality - I suppose good for the price. They're fairly comfortable and will last a few months. Not bad.
3.0,"Incredibly disappointed! The toiletry case is too short for my standard length plain old toothbrush and regular tube of toothpaste.  Since I'm not one to be putting on the clown face every morning, I don't know what else I can put in there beyond my deodorant and floss. Why someone at Baggallini didn't try putting in these most basic of toiletries I have no clue.  Surely the extra half inch or so required to make this actually functional wouldn't have broken the bank... Back to the search for something suitable for carrying those few items without leaking.<br /><br />Three stars for being well made, etc. Minus two for being poorly thought out."
3.0,square toes doest fit will for narrow foot
3.0,I like the ring but need to order a size or two bigger
3.0,"It's ok, but I think the liquid jar cleaners keep your jewelry's shine longer."
3.0,"I like the necklace its cute, only got a problem in earrings its easily fall out and make my ear itch."
3.0,"It fits a little snug and clings, so order up a size. It is a nice length and cute otherwise."
3.0,Okay for price
3.0,"A bit wide and not long enough. I am 5'6"" and it does not cover my butt"
3.0,Just did not like the way this fit.
3.0,"I've tried loads of sports bras and they're always incredible itchy, tight and uncomfortable. I bought this one to try out the long-line version and I've mostly liked it so far. My biggest issue is with the pads. There's a big pocket for them, and no stitching or design to keep them in place. They're triangular - which is fine - but they do not stay in place throughout a workout. But by the end of my workouts, they move upward are are stuck up closer to my sternum. It drives me crazy. I definitely don't want to have to be messing around and moving them around while I'm at the gym. I won't be buying another of this brand. But I did discover that I like the long-line style."
3.0,"kind of cheap shiny satin, not thrilled with it"
3.0,"Watch is very pretty, would have loved it, but the clasp is very small, hard to close and very hard to open. I don't wear it much because of that problem."
3.0,"It fits! But the collar bone was on my chest, the knees were on my thighs, and the legs stopped on my calf.  It worked and it didn't cost much."
3.0,"Arrived on time, works as expected...."
3.0,Decent. kept rolling down. Tried smaller and bigger ones they all did it.
3.0,"Extremely sheer. I am a petit but large chested woman. When wearing, the top part of the suit stretches and you can see right through. Otherwise I do like the shape but do not have the skills to add a liner."
3.0,Nice band. I just wish it had different size options.
3.0,The first one I wore broke in less than a week...but given the price that was to be expected
3.0,A little big for my wrist.  I do like it.
3.0,"Very nice on the inside. The fleece goes all the way to toes, so no need for additional socks to keep warm in winter. But the seams do break after use. In my case the waistband detached after a good stretch. Other reviews showed toe seams unravelling.<br />Oh, when you see 'Only one left in stock; order soon' in the gray, don't! :) It is a broken item that is repeatedly bought and returned."
3.0,"They feel good, don’t stay up well. Toe area sucks"
3.0,I opened the bag the necklace was in and I saw that the necklace was broken. I gave this to my mom as a present and she really liked it. I think that this would be an amazing gift to give to someone.
3.0,It seems a little short
3.0,I like this top. I would LOVE it if it was not so snug. I ordered a small because I am a size 4. The arms are snug enough to be a bit uncomfortable. I would order a medium next time for a comfortable fit and to allow for shrinking.
3.0,A bit snug and length shorter than I expected for 9 inch.
3.0,Material is a nice breathable athletic feel. It works well for its purpose. Downside is it’s a one size fits most however myself I usually wear a medium or large in tops and I honestly couldn’t see this being comfortable for someone any larger than myself as it’s cutting it close for me.
3.0,Love it but color not as picture
3.0,Nice shoes but for the price I would expect the quality to be better.
3.0,"Love these pants! I work at home and have fallen into the pjs all day routine. These pants are just as comfortable, but look nice. I plan onordering more. The packaging was also a really cute zip lock bag.<br /><br />***edit***<br />I have worn these twice, and the second time the crotch tore. I was sweaty and though baggy, they stuck to me rather than slide around. Bummed. These are cute, but I wouldn't wear them for anything active."
3.0,cute... true to style and color but smaller than other photos reviewed make them look larger on the face
3.0,"The 12/18 Month was too small for my 10 month old, ordered the next size up and am happy with it."
3.0,Item ALOY smaller than it appears
3.0,Beautiful and colorful dress...but WAY too big.I am giving it 3 stars because it really would be a nice dress if it fit.  I am 5ft 3in 34DD-29-39 . It was so large in the waist I could have fit another person in it. I had to order a medium for my bust but then the waist was enormous. I knew it would be long because most everything is long on me but even with 5in heels it was dragging the floor.
3.0,Loved it but 1 kept popping off and ended up loosing it and its gone<br /> Need another. Clasp didnt hold vey well.
3.0,"I really liked the bathing suit. It was made out of good quality material. However, I wear a 32G and the top did not hold me at all. So I gave it my friend who loves it."
3.0,"The band is pretty. However, it is so loose that it automatically slips off as soon as your arm is in a downward angle, or slips around your wrist because the elastic is very low quality. As you can see in the picture, I put a safety pin in it, and that was after I even sewed it in effort to make it fit. And even after doing both of those things, it still spins around my wrist."
3.0,"Wrapped in a dirty Ziploc bag. Ok, ignored that. Marker replica itself is heavy and the design is nice in quality and appearance. The top door piece has issue with function and that's disappointing. The hinge is very week and was bent out of the box.  Not a piece that's practical so it's a display item nothing more. Care of an adult has to be taken when handling so as to not break the hinge."
3.0,"Fits true to size but the length is very short. I’m 5’7, the bottom seam hit my ankles."
3.0,Not as pretty as in the picture. Not a fan of the material.
3.0,"Cumple con las wxpectativas . Bastante pequeño, pero muy bonito"
3.0,I haven't really used it much yet but it looks very nice and well made. I had to make some adjustments on my phones settings because the home button on my phone would not respond through the plastic screen. At first I thought I was going to have to return it but then I figured out a way to work around that. I also tried to make a call and the person on the other end could not hear me so not sure how to work around that. I basically got this so I didn't have to constantly touch my phone when shopping and checking my shopping list so I think it will work for this purpose.
3.0,"These are indeed very soft.  However, the waistband is too tight, and leaves very little flexibility.  I would suggest buying the next size higher than you think you need, and perhaps you will have better success with these than I did."
3.0,Nice coat but sending back.  I ordered large but too snug.
3.0,"Cheaply made - essentially plastic. The only reason this received three stars is because 1. I guess it was going to be cheaply made, therefore there was no disappointment. 2. The watch component did in fact work. 3. It was the appropriate dimensions and the face plate was an eagle as illustrated.<br /><br />All in all, for the correct occasion, it fulfills its purpose. I would not buy this as a &#34;serious&#34; pocketwatch, but perhaps as a costume piece (as we used it)."
3.0,We do not know if it works to block .
3.0,"I am still contemplating sending these back. I got these leggings in the antique blue and yellow design. They are very soft and very comfortable, but the print doesn't look quite like what I had expected. I am 5'5&#34; 155 lbs so maybe it just looks different on my body type than on the model, but the print does not look as sharp or put together, and has a much more childlike pattern look to it than I was hoping. I will hang onto them for now to see if I can pair them with a long basic top and boots but I may end up giving them to my skinnier little sister if I can't make them work for me."
3.0,"I love this swimsuit. It’s super cute! The only bad part is the straps pop off constantly and it’s not fit to stay up without them. I really wish the straps stayed on, because then it’d be awesome. I did keep it and wear it when I’m just laying out. If I know I’ll be moving around I choose a different option."
3.0,Wallet is great size. Cards get a little tight. Only issue I’m having is the threads starting to fall out a little on corners.
3.0,The arms of this dress fits very tightly.
3.0,Did not fit and a piece on the front that scratched my forehead
3.0,"It's still a bit big for my head and the straps used to tighten it changes the shape of the cap if pulled too much,  I still like it though.  Small heads beware."
3.0,Look closely at the colors before purchasing.  Has yellow stripes in it.
3.0,I liked the price and weight of sweater. Gray is also a easy color to work into your wardrobe. I was  disappointed with the length from neck to bottom. I was lead to believe that it would be longer. So  the biggest problem I see is the length in sleeve...from shoulder to wrist. There is NO way I can turn back the sleeves for a fashionable statement. You can see via photo. It is not lined so because of wool I will wear a long sleeve top. I am still glad that I purchased it.
3.0,"It's okay, need clothing for breastfeeding and this works well for that. Downsides, I'm tall and this dress is short which makes it look awkward, secondly, the fabric faded after just a few washes and being hung-dry inside. Passable for a cheap, breastfeeding dress."
3.0,The description says BLACK 56MM but the pictures are of a RED frame. What color are you selling?
3.0,"Fit is ok, looks nice on. The buttons make it look cheap. The button loops are white elastic, on the dark red it looks cheap, they should match the shirt. Plus there is a gap, so I will have to wear something under it.<br />I might spend the time to remove and put matching loops on it. Who wants to have to fix new clothes?"
3.0,"Wanted to be on-trend, and these seemed like the perfect pick and price. They are made well, lightweight and fun...but...are too long and the colors are overpowering for me."
3.0,"This is a beautiful nightgown.  I only gave it 3 stars because it runs very small.  I will probably give it to someone as a gift as the cost is not sufficient to warrant paying $6.95 to return it.  The color is stunning and the decor is lovely.  I own many nightgowns in the same size which are not too small, so buyer beware."
3.0,Much smaller than expected. Too expensive for what they turned out to be
3.0,Too big but cute
3.0,"i loved it, but the jacket was too small."
3.0,"I'm having a hard time finding shirts that are &#34;muscle&#34; shirts without the gaping holes under the armpits. I go to the gym & want the muscle tshirt look but am uncomfortable showing the sides of my sports bra. I bought this shirt since the pictures did not show gaping holes, but when I received it it definitely shows your sports bra. Other than that I really do like the overall look & fit."
3.0,"Recieved item but didn't realize the pants were attached to shorts, like back in the days... Bra size was too small, but with bras its a hit and miss. Overall good item"
3.0,"I really liked the look of this watch with the big face and skinny band. When I recei it, however, I was disappointed. Right out of the plastic, the face and link band were all scuffed up. Usually my mantra is &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; and that holds true in this case."
3.0,Not all loose like the picture. Smaller than expected.
3.0,I love the style and fit of this dress. It fits perfectly. I have only wore it once since I purchased it due to the zipper coming apart. I wasn't even wearing it when the zipper broke i was trying to pull the zipper back up to put the dress away and it broke. The zipper was really hard to zip to begin with!
3.0,I purchased this for myself in hopes of having something with a little pizzazz but I haven't been able to bring myself to wear it as it looks like it might hurt after awhile with the petals the way they are.  I still have it and it looks nice but wasn't really what I was hoping for.  It came quickly and had no broken pieces and looks exactly like the picture so it may be something great for someone else.
3.0,"I can already tell it's not gonna last more than a couple months tops.It's not sewn together very well, but I've had worse. If your gonna buy this I'd recommend buying a couple at a time, especially if you're going to wear it on the job."
3.0,It was sufficient. A little thin.
3.0,"Like the dress, fit is a tad tight. Unfortunately before I even put it on, I found the seam is busted right at the base of the zipper. Not what I was expecting for $30.00"
3.0,The the shorts are not suitable for long rides. Chamois is very thin. I only use them for short rides on a trainer. I find them fairly suitable for this purpose but still have to use but balm.
3.0,The actual keychain is nice but the clasp is a little flimsy. Overall it’s a cute keychain.
3.0,Way longer than the photo suggests...unless you're 6'7&#34;
3.0,This duster runs a little on the large side. It also retains the wrinkles even after being washed with softener. But it is light weight and covers what you want covered.
3.0,"Totally shapeless. The dress appears to have a curve to it, but it is totally A-line. Perfect for a vacation, and looks fine belted, but needs a waist band or something to really look right on you if you're large busted. Would look perfect on somebody with a smaller chest or a more rectangular shape."
3.0,"I was looking for a crush-proof case for my reading glasses that would fit in my front pants pocket.<br /><br />I could not find any ""armored"" case that were low profile enough to fit, yet strong enough to do the job (I broke several pair in trials).<br /><br />I started getting ""tactical"" cases in my search results, and after deciding I would own wearing my glasses on my belt, like my cell phone, I chose the 1000D: It held my reading glasses in a soft case, and a capacitive pen--nice.<br />However there were a couple of down checks:<br /><br />First off, MOLLE isn't right -- at least to the military standard. The MOLLE system includes PALS webbing;the PALS standard strips are spaced 1 inch apart, and sewn to the backing at 1.5-inch intervals.<br /><br />The strip and loops on this pouch are 3/4 inch width webbing.  The loops are ""secured"" with Velcro.<br /><br />The spacing is not a big problem since I use a ""Utility Belt Weave"" -- feeding the strip through the bottom loop to the snap connect (also not PALS standard), to make a tighter fit against my belt -- so it doesn't have to match the PALS  grid standard, but it is deceptively named.<br /><br />The bigger sin is low quality: after a few months, the Velcro is wearing out on the bottom strip and the machine stitching is giving out.  I snag the pouch a few times a week in tight quarters, so it may not last.<br /><br />Overall: for 12 bucks and change, it's not a bad pouch, but it's about what you pay for; medium grade imitation gear.<br /><br />One final caveat: if you wear the pouch on your belt people may get a little nervous -- especially if you have a other pouches hanging as well-- announce ""excuse me, I need my glasses"" before you draw them out, to be on the safe side.<br /><br />This is Doubly True if you use suspenders to hold up the rig and your trousers; it puts out a real ""utility belt"" vibe and winds up looking like an paramilitary ALICE setup from the 70's."
3.0,I brought this for my dad who is 72. He had a had time putting these sock on. I am sure it works great for some people but not sure for the elders.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress for the price, but didnt hit the mark. The material was thin, cheap, and borderline see-through. The elastic around the neckline also cheapens it. It would absolutely look fine from a distance, but up close it's not well suited for a formal event. I'm returning it.<br />At 5'6"" and 140 pounds, the medium was several inches too big. The slit wasnt too revealing, but would be if it caught a breeze and would need to be pinned down."
3.0,Snap holder came off one side in a matter of weeks. lost 3 snaps prior to the whole thing coming off... comfy but not practical for your favoritee snaps
3.0,"They were more like tights, not leggings. I ordered the one size fits all but got something my daughter couldn't wear. I may have misread? The quality seemed good, just not what I was wanting."
3.0,Helps somewhat
3.0,"The product is really nice!  Nice soft leather, 3 different areas, inner and outer zipper.  For my purpose it does not work the way I wish.  I wear readers.  The leather is thin enough that anything in side the purse shows every bump and bulge.  You can see my glasses, my lip balm and definitely keys. Nice,  but not for me."
3.0,I AM 6'2&#34; AND THE ROBE IS A BIT SHORT ON MY FRAME.  IT IS ALSO VERY LIGHTWEIGHT - DON'T COUNT ON THIS TO KEEP YOU WARM.
3.0,Very lightweight..was as advertised and would purchase again
3.0,"I love this nightgown, the fabric is very soft and it's a good quality. The only reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is that I ordered an 8/10 and it fits great everywhere except the arm holes are WAY too small and there is no stretch to them so I will need to adapt them to make them comfortable."
3.0,"These jeans seem to be good quality, but they run incredibly large! I bought them for my petite 11 year old, but they were almost big enough to fit me (I'm 5'4"" and weigh about 125lbs.)! I had to return them."
3.0,The colors aren't as shown.  Only yellow & blue.
3.0,Arrived in time but waaaay too small.
3.0,"Pretty but, Too small!"
3.0,These pants would be perfect if they would listen to the customers and make a better elastic waistband instead of making us use the crappy drawstring that doesn't even hold up for long
3.0,Our son was instructed to wear polka dots to school for an art project. I wasn't sure how to do that with boys apparel/attire. We found this and he wore it to school. It was kind of a hit. My only issue is that the suspenders were a little shorter than we had hoped for. They worked okay for this event but I think it would be a better fit for a 3-6 year old. My son is 7 and tall for his age.
3.0,"The material is stiff, doesn't feel like Danskin. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"I got the red dress in a size large. I am probably a size 12 right now.  The sleeves were too tight and I couldn't raise my arms up while wearing it. it is a very pretty dress though, and if it wasn't for the arms issue I would keep it. I definitely recommend getting a bigger size if you are unsure of the size."
3.0,was very big but nice
3.0,The size is way off .
3.0,Very nice but chain broke
3.0,"Very thin, the threading is coming apart. Cool to look at but not convenient"
3.0,"I would have preferred a longer handle, but they work great for scooping out creams and scraping the bottom of (small 2oz or smaller) jars to get the remaining contents out - avoiding waste - especially for expensive cosmetics!  If I can find longer handled disposable spatulas I will order them. Otherwise I would order these again... especially for the smaller jars."
3.0,Too small for my band but it was cool
3.0,"its very nice but runs very small.i had to give it to my skinny daughter, but its nice for her"
3.0,Runs small and clingy
3.0,Cute. Big under arms and a little boxey
3.0,"There is nothing special about this belt.  It is an overpriced basic leather belt of acceptable quality.  I got this belt as I found that every now and then I got a little sag with my concealed weapon at with my desired fit.  At first,  this belt seemed slightly better.  After a week, it is definitely worse than my heavy leather work belt.  The attached picture shows that the belt has itself developed a permanent sag, before even putting weight on it.  This is just a week of use.  My orriginal belt is a heavy duty work belt i picked up at the boot barn for about the same price.  It holds the weight up significantly better than this one which was supposedly built for the purpose.  When I hold out an 8"" loop on both and press them against the wall, my orriginal work belt feels significantly more ridgid.  In addition,  the work belt has closer holes, and looks better.  If you have a cheap belt from Wally world this one will be an improvement,  but a good genuine leather work belt will be better."
3.0,Soft and comfortable but they loose the shape in the first wear. Dont wash with anything else that u dont want getting lint balls on.
3.0,They are very soft to touch . I should have ordered a leg and not extra lg but at the same time I’m 5’8 and extra lg feels like the fit to loose. But the length on the legs I wish was maybe an inch longer. So if I had gotten the lg size instead of extra lg. I think they really would have been to short. Overall I’m not super happy but I rarely return items and I got them for 15 with a discount and they are super soft. So I will continue to wear them they fit comfortably in my thighs and waits but from the knees down they are loose so look more like a straight leg pants
3.0,The picture makes it seem that the beads go all the way around the ankle but it doesn't it only goes half way and the other side has no dangle beads. I wasn't to happy.
3.0,Dress fit me but I didn't like how it looked.... the material is also kind of weird.... it has a strange trxture
3.0,"It's OK, very understated and cheap feeling. Almost comically small, at least compared to my comically large gshock (which I don't wear that often). I'll probably give to kids to play with"
3.0,Tiro muy alto!
3.0,Good for their price!
3.0,"I purchased the Dear-Lover Women 3 pcs Satin Tie Lace Top and Panty Lingerie Set quite a while ago, and when I finally got it, I was very happy with the set, but it took several weeks to arrive. It is an &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; product, so I was expecting it to come in two days, but that was not the case at all. When I did finally get it and tried it on I like the way it fit most of my body. I am just under 5' 8&#34; and about 120 pounds, so I have a very thin build, and it fit pretty well. It all ties on nicely so you can adjust it to fit however tight or loose you would like. It was a little difficult keeping my breasts in place, but I have nursed 3 children, so they do not quite &#34;sit&#34; like they used to. They lace feels stronger than I was expecting it to be and did not tear or shred at all. The ribbon is soft and pretty wide, which makes it a little more comfortable as well. The panties were a little different than I was expecting, but once I figured out how to put them on it was really cute. They are not most comfortable things in the world, so I ended up just taking them off anyway, but I think it is something I could have dealt and still enjoyed. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review that I am happy to give."
3.0,It looked cheap.
3.0,Looks great .. bigger than what I thought it was going to be but works for what I needed at the moment
3.0,Based on the picture I thought this was either glitter or rhinestone or some type of sparkle.  It's not.  It's basically just fabric with a polka dot pattern.  For the price it's OK but I was expecting something different.  They should fix their pictures.
3.0,"I bought this for a trip to Jamaica! It is soft and has a nice feel to it, it’s comfortable and the pockets are great. I gave it 3 stars because the first picture is misleading in color, it appears to be more navy and a soft white (which is nicer looking) and different than the 2nd picture that shows the true color of stark white and royal blue. Still cute and comfortable. I’m 5’3 and 140lbs, I usually wear a medium or large, but I got a small in this dress and it fits great!"
3.0,"I did not have high expectations for these pants and I was not surprised. These are not excellent. The material feels fake (I know that doesn't make sense, but it feels like fake fabric). I'm sure it's the polyester blend that makes it feel that way. They seem to run a bit short. I am 5'4 115lbs and the small fell above my ankle.<br /><br />I feel like these are exact;y as described and for that reason, I have no complaints. I would not purchase again."
3.0,I didn’t like it. The shade part of the hat is not sturdy.
3.0,The size in the description is different than what I received.
3.0,"Packaged great, except it crushed one of the head bands. Slightly larger than expected. The ribbon on the shoes was frayed & taped which was extremely annoying!"
3.0,Ok for most of the day but broke easily and got caught on things.
3.0,The material it's different from all the other scrubs that I have from this same brand. It's súper thin and you can see through. still a pretty  scrub top.
3.0,"Pretty, like the pix, but the prong was too long for my ear so the flowers drooped a little. They would work better with &#34;fatter lobes&#34;."
3.0,"I like this Tshirt logo.  Being that it is a red shirt that I purchased I gave it the bleed test... It passed with out showing any signs of the red coming out of the shirt.  It fit in size as expected, but there is a different cut on the under sleeve that cuts back to the arm some.  This might be by design.  The fabric content that was received was different that shows in the description.  I received an 80% cotton/ 20% polyester.  Nice shirt."
3.0,"Great fit, sizing seems accurate and material feels to be just as sturdy as other brands found on Amazon. My issue is with the design not matching the pic shown. The rings I received have very dull/flattened stud shapes, which is to be expected after wearing the ring for awhile, but shouldn't be right out of the bag. The blue and black rings are the best shaped of the group, with white and silver being the worst. It's still a good price for the quality and quantity but if you're a stickler for details, this won't be for you."
3.0,"Better quality than some of the other pillows that I recently bought. It does have a linen like texture. Picture quality isn't the best, but I have bought worse (not knowingly). Shipping did take awhile since it came from China."
3.0,"A perfectly charming, very cheap holiday dress.  Should be good for wearing once or twice."
3.0,Not made very well. You get what you pay for
3.0,Low quality needed to get them altered to fit.
3.0,I was very pleased with them when I first got them because they are small and but they hurt my ears because I don't have a very thick earlobe so I have to pinch then quite a bit to get them to stay and even then they flop down and look like dangly earring sometimes. Not something you would wear every day that's for sure.
3.0,This isn't a scarf; it's a poncho with a hood. It's very soft and pretty but I wasn't looking for something I have to pull over my head
3.0,"Perfect rose-gold color, but these earrings are heavy, and my petite, delicate ears just don't like the weight.  I'm sure for someone else they would be fine."
3.0,I like it but I had to order one size down
3.0,Very nice but don’t feel as expected. I would keep looking for something softer and silkier. Looks super nice and feels ok; but....
3.0,"I have a small frame, ordered ""m"" found them to extremely hard to put on and remove, plus a bit pricey"
3.0,Just received them. Thinner than I was hoping for but the waistline falls at a nice place and doesn’t ‘squeeze’ the extra lbs around the hips and tummy. Will likely return though because i needed something a little thicker for jogging/walking outside when it’s chilly.  I also wish it had pockets.
3.0,Top fits too big and bottom too small. Colors are really nice.
3.0,Way too large. I followed suggestion and ordered larger
3.0,"Like the color, the chin ties, and the large brim. The hat itself was just too big...even w the adjustable string"
3.0,Had issues with the zipper
3.0,"I am 5'3"" and unfortunately the torso of this suit was too long for me.  The material is good quality.  If it had fit, I definitely would have kept it."
3.0,Looks cheap and fake. Probably wouldn't buy again.
3.0,Appears to be plastic with a metal coating.  Not malleable.
3.0,"After reading all of the reviews about the sizing, I bought this coat in the 3x size for my adult daughter that normally wears an American medium for Christmas.  I tried it on to see about the fit, since she won't try it on for size until Christmas.  For me, it's too small even in the shoulders and sleeve length (I'm 5'1&#34; but weigh 140ish)..  and now way could I button it.  She is smaller than me, so I hope it fits.  I also tried it on her little sister who is 10 who is tall for her age, and it was about the right size but the sleeves were long.  I'm hoping it will fit the daughter I bought it for, glad the return window is after Christmas, so we will have options it if doesn't fit her.  The coat is cute, the color looks like the picture, the coat is thinner than it looks but not bad.  It would not be sufficient in really cold climates."
3.0,I really like these earrings they are smaller than I usually wear but I really like them very cute
3.0,Wedding it's just okay!
3.0,It’s print on plastic.  Not sure how I missed that.  However the image is on both sides so extra star for that.
3.0,"These gloves looked good and felt great, but I will use these in deer bow season and there is a substantial chemical odor that permeated this pair.  I spent 2 weeks getting this smell out with soaps, baking soda, and finishing off with an ozone generator.  Now the are good to go and my hands don’t smell of chemicals."
3.0,the moon fell off with in a couple days of wearing it
3.0,It's not how it looks in the picture it was almost to small if you are an xl order a size up it's made of nylon not cotton so it has lil stretch in it
3.0,"I got a medium and it's borderline being a small so get 1 size up. It's fine and does the job for me, I mainly got it for I.d. pocket and the hook because I have lots of keys for work and need quick access to them. Also they quickly sent it out. It will serve its purpose."
3.0,"Love the shirt, runs short and snug though"
3.0,"First of all, overall these have worked well for the three or so months that I've had them. The straps are very well made and the material used is fantastic for not pulling on your leg hairs as much as others I have used.<br /><br />I only have two complaints, though one doesn't necessarily effect me very much. My first issue is that the clamps are awful when you have this shirts.  I life in Florida so I prefer to wear thin shirts so that I'm not burning up every day. This causes a problem because the clamps don't clamp down well enough and this things happen: the clamps slides around from where I originally intended to have it latch on, or it slips off all together. I've had days where I can't even walk out of the house without it snapping off my shirt. Other days it works well and I have no issue. But again it largely depends on the shirt I'm wearing.<br /><br />The second issue which doesn't effect me too much is the the straps are super short. I'm 5'7&#34;, not a very tall man, and I have to set the straps to the longest they can go or else they tug way too hard on my shirt. Again given my size it isn't a big deal because when they are at their longest setting it is perfect for me, but given the weak clamps and that most people are taller I can imagine many people being able to deal with the length options these provide.<br /><br />Overall, they are good if you have thick material shirts and if you tend to be a shorter stature."
3.0,I ordered the matte finish but when it arrived today it was not a matte finish. I still like the glasses I just wanted the matte finish...
3.0,Skirt split was wayyy too high. I wanted last minute to get a dress for a funeral so I had to sew a quick stich so it stayed closed enough for public. But I was in a church and felt super uncomfortable.
3.0,"I chose a pattern instead of basic black like my husband's and liked the look. Like all compression socks, tight and initial struggle to get on but that is what they are meant for. My legs were getting irritated on a 10 hour flight, so I periodically adjusted them.  When we landed and I was able to take them off, I discovered the source of the irritation.  The way the pattern was knit, the interior seems for all the diamonds was rough and pronounced. I had the argyle diamond pattern deeply imprinted on my legs. Thankfully I was going to a cold weather destination and not a place I would want to wear shorts. Will not use these again."
3.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding I was in. We all were very different sizes and it seem to work for us all. We all ordered up 1 size and luckily we did. We all took the built on wire out of the top because it made our boobs look pointy.<br />The dress was very long and not the most comfortable. Upon recieveing it, it had a smell about it that needed to go. It was nor pleasant. But none the less the wedding was beautiful and all of us bridesmaids looked uniform."
3.0,"Why I gave this product 3 star its because I ordered a purple shade and was given black without being informed apart from this, the frames are good quality, light weight, I really like the case nice."
3.0,My chest was all over the place and it was too big on my body but tight on my chest I’m five 4 breast 40ddd after having a baby but it was wide on my body If your chest is big wear a jean shirt or a sweater over it or they will be every where lol
3.0,"They are beautiful  and nicely wrapped. But, the sharp part oft he pin does not fit very well into its hook."
3.0,"This is a beautiful pendant, but it has a very tiny bale!  The box chain that came with it barely fit. If you like an 18” adjustable box chain, this may be for you! I did not think the box chain enhanced the look of the pendant.<br /><br />I am petite, and an 18” chain does not look right on me.  I wanted to wear this with a shorter, different style chain, but none of the very many that I own would fit.  The box chain also had a kink in it.  Unfortunately, this is going back."
3.0,Wish this had built in bra but otherwise feels great
3.0,It's larger than I expected.<br />Well made and nice looking.<br /><br />The clasp was loose so it kept falling off until I eventually lost the pin.
3.0,This was more like a dress for me. I’m 5’0ft 135lbs and it fell just above my knees. It was pretty but not what I was looking for
3.0,Nice looking hat...but it is made in China. Maybe I should have looked into that a little more before purchasing it.
3.0,"The pendant is just like the photo, but the necklace has no beads on it. I bought it for the beads and the pendant. It unfortunately does not look like the photos. It’s kinda disappointing."
3.0,"Cute, but too small for my daughter."
3.0,don’t last long
3.0,"I ordered this dress to wear out on dates. When I received the dress and tried it on it was not what I expected. The dress hits my mid calf and is very thin. It has a side zipper to help you put it on. The neckline is a crew style, I was hoping more for scoop neck. You can see you underwear lines through this dress. Overall, I was very disappointed. I was happy the dress fit well though. It is true to size. I wear a size 6 in dresses and a size small fit well. I am 5 feet tall 118 pounds and very busty. Sometimes dresses just don't fit around my bust, thankfully this one does. I plan to keep the dress, but I would not buy another. I will post photos soon."
3.0,"Mask is beautiful and well made but unfortunately its WAY too big for my face and super loose, sad I can't wear it."
3.0,Nice shirt but made too short. I can't wear it. Shows my bellybutton 🤷‍♀️
3.0,"I was disappointed when this necklace arrived and several of the strands were broken.  Since there are multiple stands you cannot tell, so I was able to make it work.  The packaging is not the best so I'm not surprised the content was damaged.  It took a little over a month to arrive since it was coming so far.  The price was extremely low, so I really can't expect much!  Overall, I would not purchase again."
3.0,Too tight around the neck and the gingham on the bib is lower/shorter than it should be.
3.0,Length too long and waist too small
3.0,"I thought I was going to love this, as I have other products from Lave Core that I do really like. But the problem with this was that it was so small! I'm normally a size 5, but I got a size 8 because I like my suits to be loose. However, there was no way I could fit into this one. I returned it and in exchange got a size 12, which was also a little tighter than I would have liked, but still usable. I'm thinking it may loosen up once I start using it. I will write a new review after I use it a few times. I think I'm going to like the larger one however."
3.0,"They fit over my glasses very well, but they weren't exactly that &#34;cool&#34; looking. lol"
3.0,Loved the look of this tank but it didn't fit. I normally wear a small but I ordered a medium just in case. The medium was even too small for me so I had to return. Be sure to size up when ordering.
3.0,Super weird quality and material
3.0,Fit smaller than expected and the image on the socks gets very distorted.
3.0,Nice but very easy to ravel.
3.0,"They are nice,  just a little snug in the waist. The drawstring should be the color of the pants for uniformity."
3.0,"This charm is very beautiful and I would love to have it on my bracelet... however, the hole on the side where you hook it to the bracelet isn't big enough... Please start making it bigger. I bought 11 of them and I was only able to put on 6. The other 5 doesn't fit."
3.0,"Nice little dress. The material is a little thin, but the dress is fun and flattering."
3.0,This shirt is shorter than expected and very thin
3.0,they’re a good size and we’re very pretty. BUT every ring i’ve used i only had in for a couple days before the paint chipped off. they’re useless to me now and will have to find new ones elsewhere.
3.0,Not the quality I expected. Too much trouble to return. Maybe my young niece can use it.
3.0,Not getting quality as expected
3.0,solves the purpose. but veggi and fruit juice seeps in to the glove and feel uncomfortable.
3.0,They were cute but one wouldn't stay sticking for very long at all and I had to use glue to keep it on for the festival
3.0,"The color is bright Kelly Green. The material appears to be Jersey Knit in reality. What I dont care for in this dress is the shortness of the front, more like for a very petite height. It was mid-thigh in length with the low portion coming only past the back of my knees. Had the entire dress been about 4” longer overall, I probably would have given it a 5-star review. As it is, will be returning."
3.0,This was so cute!! But after first wash in cold water both pairs of the pajama shorts faded where the tops did not so shorts look older than tops. Disappointed as they are really adorable and fit well.
3.0,Not stitched very well
3.0,"This is a thin jacket and really, really oversized."
3.0,I bought a medium based on the description and size chart. I would say the corset is probably an xs and would maybe fit someone with a 32a-b bra size. The arm bands are more like wrist bands for me. They won’t go around my arm if my life depended on it. The skirt is definitely a medium to a large and the cape won’t even snap on to the corset bc the snaps don’t match the holes they are supposed to snap into. I’m not sure if this is a bunch of different costumes thrown into a medium package or what’s going on. Huge disappointment
3.0,"I really liked this dress, but it had two holes in separate areas on the back of the dress in the pleated area. I decided not to reorder it because I was worried the quality would be the same on the new one. If it wasn't for that it was a super cute dress, and fit perfect in size large. I'm short and large busted."
3.0,"I'm not sure how I feel about this dress. The material kind of makes it look like a nightgown. I got the dress in black and was planning on wearing it on an upcoming trip. I'm going to try it with a wrap or jacket. In my opinion, the dress is about $10 too high for what you get. Just OK for me."
3.0,"I love the concept, but the edges were very bumpy like it hadn't come neatly out of the mold when it was made.  I was a little disappointed as I was giving it as a gift, and I was hoping my mom didn't notice..."
3.0,The color in the picture looks khaki but it is actually a cream or off white color.  Bit disappointed but its still nice.
3.0,I followed the directions for size and the dress was huge. Cute dress and well made just really big.
3.0,love the watch hate the light for night
3.0,"I usually love Nike sports bras, but this one was a little disappointing for me. It runs a little big, and the removable pad is one large pad with a big opening across the top. Having one pad instead of two and having such a big slit for it made the bra sit awkwardly on my chest.<br />It probably would’ve been comfortable, but the fit just wasn’t right for me."
3.0,Was already turned a little old looking when I got it... but still cute.
3.0,so both the front and back of the neck are exposed and feel the wind. also the face mask is not big enough to cover both the nose and chin. one of the two stays exposed.<br />But aside from that it is very warm and soft.
3.0,Love the tote but after 3 months the lining started ripping
3.0,"These are great for kids and adults alike. I bought for my girls and my mother to pick and choose between. They were very happy with the earrings! This made me happy.<br />However, my only issues was that there were only 7 pairs sent. The round ones with the stone was not in the bag. I'm disappointed."
3.0,Nice sweater but very tight on the forearm. That is a little strange as the model has it rolled up in the picture. I returned it as it was too tight just in the forearms to consider keeping the sweater.
3.0,"Ordered these for my daughter, she absolutely loves them. Unfortunately though by the time she got to wear them for the event they were ordered for she noticed a tear in the seam of the crotch and it was to late to exchange them. I will be taking them to a seamstress to be repaired."
3.0,"I love the idea of this dress, but I took off two stars for quality. I wish I could rate it 3.5. I ordered the black/pink in small. The fit was great on the waist (27 inch) but tight on the bust and chest (34 c) Length was amazing, right past my knee (5.6) And the sleeves were short, more like 3/4 arm. The fabric was VERY thin. As if I needed an under shirt up top. And it was faded already, not only in color but a white cast as if it had been washed before. Camera somewhat picks it up. I don't think it will hold up long. Other colors may not have this issue. Overall quite comfortable. I could do a medium in the chest but the waist would hang too much."
3.0,Fabric is soft with a good hand to it. However the length of the striped bodice was so long this dress could not be considered an empire waist. The waistband hit 1/2 inch above my belly button. It made me look frumpy. The arms were a bit tight through the forearm. The length was perfect and I'm 5'9.
3.0,Was a little disappointed. Not the quality that I thought. But the look is very nice
3.0,Smaller than expected but a really unique gift!
3.0,They are pretty thin
3.0,Returned the product.  Too bulky and the style was just wrong for my body type.
3.0,"These sunglasses are great for the Fourth, and really any other time of year. I have had a lot of compliments while wearing both of these (camo and American Flag). However, these are not fit to be worn while driving or operating any sort of machinery. These are for the sole purchase of just being awesome."
3.0,"The top was very pretty but ran EXTREMELY small. I ended up giving it away. I had ordered a large, which should have been loose on me and I couldn't even get it over my head."
3.0,"The 6-12 months size is easily a 3/4T. It’s HUGE. And very thin, itchy feeling material."
3.0,Lighter color than the picture.
3.0,Sagged right out of the package .<br />I have a size 7.5 foot
3.0,The charms are cheap and I took them off.  The band is uncomfortable and I ended up buying a real leather band for the watch.  The watch looks and feels better now that the charms are gone and the band has been replaced.  All in all not really worth buying.
3.0,"There is a lot to live about this dress, however I'm an 18/20 at 5'8&#34; with broad shoulders and a high waist and this dress his above my waist line. After reading multiple reviews I purchased a 3x and it fits comfortably throughout. But the top seems to be short and it causes the skirt to land almost right underneath my chest almost causing a baby doll dress look. My only other comment is due to the tops shortness it causes the skirt to be above my knees by 3 inches. Not even remotely fitting like it does on the model. Many women have posted pictures where it looks like the models dress and then where it looks like it does on me. Most likely this is a manufacturing defect, certainly an unfortunate one."
3.0,"Necklace and earrings we're fine, pretty, but was not expecting ring to be the same size.  A bit oversized.  Really like the stone."
3.0,"Bought these about three years ago and still use them. However, the ones with the spiked ends are difficult to take off and I've had one stuck in for about two years."
3.0,"It's a good purchase for the price, and will suit my needs for a quick beach trip, but look closely at the pics and zoom in; the zipper clutch doesn't match the bag.  The bag is half gold metallic, the zipper pouch is half silver metallic (and is darker pink).  Still does the job, but not as cute of a matching set as I was hoping.  Oh well, I'm on a beach :)"
3.0,"The product was okay, it was very see through and it was a little cheaply made"
3.0,I like this dress but it was not as pictured. Dissapointing because there was very little blue print in it.
3.0,"They run small. Order a bigger size than you need. Also, large white tag on the inside of the tank isn't shown in picture. I wouldn't have ordered them if I knew that. It's kinda ugly and you cant remove it."
3.0,"The bag smelled horrible when it arrived, like acrid chemicals. I've wiped it down with vinegar to try to displace the scent. Then I rubbed baking soda on it. Smell is mostly gone, but faint chemical smell mixed with vinegar remains. Will try sprinkling a small amount of cinnamon on it to mask the remaining odor before I gift it. Really, what are you doing to the bag to make it smell this atrocious? It looks good though."
3.0,decent product does the job.
3.0,"The material is somewhat silky feeling. The chest area fits nice but is a bit snug around my belly.  I am XXL, so yes a larger belly area.  Just waiting to loose some belly fat to be able to actually wear this one with confidence."
3.0,"I have looked for this design FOREVER.  I bought a bunch of these Danskin over the years at another big box store that shall not be named and they have been my absolute favorite and I have every brand name sports bra you can think of.  This is the same brand and same style but something is just a little off.  It feels too stiff in the band and they just aren't as comfortable.  Still not at all a bad bra but my expectations were really high.  I still love, love, love that it's a front closure bra.  I never worry about it popping open or me popping out, even when I'm upside down in a handstand."
3.0,SMALLER THAN LOOKS ONLINE
3.0,Not great for everyday use tore very quickly
3.0,Like it but I have a large bust of you are bigger busted order a size up
3.0,"I ordered two pair of these slacks and was so excited to receive the slacks in a hounds-tooth print and a navy floral print that were advertised as corduroys. I ordered the large, which would be a size 12-14 and what I received had to have been a size 16-18. Both pair of slacks were super big on me and there was no way I could make them fit. I was also disappointed that they weren't really corduroys as advertised, considering I paid $44 for each pair of slacks. What they were was a very, very, very thin rib of corduroy. So disappointing and so deceptive. Needless to say, I packed those jokers up the same day they arrived and took them to UPS to return."
3.0,The top is tiny and I don't feel comfortable swimming around the family.  It is cute and the body of it is fine.
3.0,"I purchased the multi color pack in my size from the sizing chart. The Blue and the white pair fit extremely tight around the legs and waist. Great fit on the grey and black pairs. I’d probably order again, but only in the black pairs. See how they hold up after a few washings, if they get any tighter...I’m gonna returns them all."
3.0,"the material is very thin, I like the overall fit. Need to wear leggings underneath it's rather sheer."
3.0,The right skirt for color  but fit is not good
3.0,Pretty dress but it’s  see thru will need something under
3.0,not great coverage in back...
3.0,"These work fine initially, but they don't hold up well. The hooks come off, if I don't squeeze them together every time they're used. The button on the adjustable slider broke off of a few, as well."
3.0,"Warm and waterproof. Problem is the lining inside the jacket and bibs are noisy. On a quiet morning deer will hear you move. A little breeze will cover the noise. But I wanted something warm, waterproof and quiet. Kinda bummed!"
3.0,A little short in the front if you are 5'8 or taller
3.0,The fit is perfect. But a little bit sheer for me.
3.0,"Love the pattern and fit, but stitching is coming undone in some areas so now I need to take it to get fixed."
3.0,"Product arrived on time, 2nd order parts missing in small plastic bag. Other wise very good gogels."
3.0,It’s ok for a quick fix
3.0,"Bought this cover in 9/2016.<br />Gave it a good intitial review.<br />Had to knock it down to three stars because the protecting patches you add to protect the cover from sharp corners failed<br />to stick to the cover. They fell off after one month. The just don't stick.<br /><br />The other thing they could improve is to add more straps to snug the cover to the RV.<br />The seller claimed forward the manufacturer these comments, I didn't get a response."
3.0,It’s a good watch for 35 $
3.0,The necklace's are very nice and quality are good
3.0,"I like this band as it’s more elegant than most Apple watch bands. Handy when I’m wearing a dressy outfit. However, the clasp is pretty difficult to work with. I’m not sure I’d have gotten it if I’d known that."
3.0,Very cute but bow fell off after only 3 wears
3.0,"I ordered a larger size, should have ordered my right size.  Material a little light but I have never purchased swim wear, don't know how it's suppose to look, feel, wear."
3.0,"Looks cheap. Fast delivery and is exactly as decribed. In person, looks too cheap for me to rate higher than 3 stars. I won't ever wear it."
3.0,It was fine but small
3.0,I returned them. Too small
3.0,"So I’m super pleased with the presentation it was Packaged so pretty great job, it’s beautiful I’m excited to wear it. However you get what you pay for. It’s a little flimsy not the best quality but it will get the job done I tried it on to make for it fit well and I was scared it would break I danced in it a little bit because I’ll actually be dancing in it for the party I’m going to and it was cool I’m not wearing it until October 25th 2019 to a masquerade ball. So let’s see how it holds up after 4-5 hours with me dancing and drinking the night away lol"
3.0,The product looks in expensive. Almost like costume jewelry.  The post bend.  And backs are very small.
3.0,Super cute! I got it as a gift from my husband but the necklace turned my neck green
3.0,Was packaged so poorly there was nothing in package when I got it
3.0,The item itself seems indestructible considering how smashed up the packaging is.  I'm trying to find a way to make it look better so I can give it as a gift.
3.0,"was a gift. Fit decently, was good condition upon arrival. Too bad the person that got it turned out to be an insult to our great nation."
3.0,"I agree with the other reviewer, the shirt is shorter than I'd like, for a maternity shirt"
3.0,"Pretty cool shirt all around. However, I wear a size large which is what I ordered and it is way too tight sizing is off by a full-size if not two sizes."
3.0,"OK, but too large!"
3.0,"They wouldn't go on my toddler's foot. He does have a high arch on top, but these had no stretch like other toddler tennis shoes."
3.0,Doesn't glow very well.
3.0,The grips slip or break very quickly.
3.0,"I am a 34 D & the large was more like for a B cup. Side boob galore :) Bra itself is nice material & the color is beautiful, just too small."
3.0,"You get what you pay for really. They're cool looking and fun, but the stitching makes it tough to fit most shades these days. I've managed to cram most of my sunglasses in there, but it required some ripping. They also don't feel comfortable over the ear due to the bulkiness, but that could simply be my own personal unfamiliarity with this type of product."
3.0,Beautiful product problem is that they turnt a green nasty color a high grade plastic would work well and wouldn't turn
3.0,It is thicker material and shorter length than the Buff brand that I normally wear.  OK under 80 degrees but starts to get hot at higher temps.<br /><br />It has a seam that I don't care for and it is on the side with the v-neck extension so it sits on your lips/chin.
3.0,This ain't it. Silk lining one button that's more like a bra strap hook
3.0,Pretty but the material wrinkles very easily
3.0,Sizing not accurate according to guidance (actual is smaller than guidance)
3.0,"No parece  de cuero y los huecos se agrandan no deberían,  o sea que se daña muy rápido mala inversión"
3.0,Followed stores size chart & should not have these run true to size . Gave to sister .<br />Reference I'm 5ft 4 in waist currently is 43 inches ( quarantine fat ) 😒 XL would still fit chart reads 2xl . They were decent quality .
3.0,Bad Chain--It broke right awat and could not be repaired.  The round pendant was nice.
3.0,It is very pretty but it is way too big. I can get the dowels out to adjust it to fit so I haven't been able to wear it.
3.0,"the liner is not great. I wish it had a better one, I am mostly doing water walking so I don't think it will be much of an issue for me. The shorts are nice and fit modestly. Which is nice, hard to find swimming wear that I feel comfortable in."
3.0,"I loved these pants - the look, the style, but I was unable to wear them - they are high-waisted as desired, but they just aren't designed for us vintage women - I returned them - I received my credit immediately - thanks for the effort though."
3.0,"It's a good mask but it's definitely a little big for my face. All in all, though it's great!"
3.0,"Fades after the first wash, but it’s cute."
3.0,"Sizing is not an issue. Ordered my true size, medium. I am 5’4” and fluctuate between 138 and 142. The mediums fit perfect - not too tight, not loose, not too short. Colors are super cute and material not see through. However, these undoubtably give you camel toe and pulling them down to avoid this does not work well - you either end up with loose saggy fabric in your crotch & uneven leg lengths from front to back, or you deal with the camel toe. Being these were purchased to be used at the gym/hiking, I will be returning."
3.0,Too bulky for my taste.  Good price.  If you are looking for something to wear as a statement piece this would be ok.
3.0,"This is an acceptable wrist band that worked well with my Moto 360 first gen watch, though I seem to have slightly larger than normal wrist. I needed to buy two bands to get the extra links. Even then the links were still slightly off and I needed to grind down the link connectors to work together. That is not why I marked the band down though. In all honesty, the band is simply just OK, not great but not bad either. It works fine but quality of the metal could be better I feel."
3.0,"It's okay, but it's very small for a grown man's head. It looked ridiculous on my husband and one of our grand daughters will likely end up with it.  So I'm somewhat disappointed at the over all size of the hat.."
3.0,fit great and are holding up very good i put them to the test so far and they made it good !!!!!!!!!!!!!! not waterproof !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3.0,Its ok but after wearing it for a month (very comfy) most of the letters washed off so it is trash now...
3.0,Fits smaller the material is thin but it’s super cute
3.0,The bra cups and width is great (40C/XL) but the straps are too short and dig in to my shoulders. I'm hoping it'll stretch out but I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I thought the stone was more rounded and not so flat.  It is still nice, but I purchased as a gift, and did not use, as it was not what I thought.  It is still pretty, I will wear them myself."
3.0,"They are definitly lovely . Yet, like other users have described,  they don't sit flat . I am thinking of sewing them on to the top I want to use them with."
3.0,"Even though this outfit was pretty, it ran small, well the coat did, the pants fit fine...and it is NOT a “Track Suit”. This outfit is made of the shiny silky material that most of the outfits are made of. I am 5’6”, 170lbs, 38D, 30 waist, 42 hip. I got a large. Pants were a great fit. Jacket was a tad snug yet I did have room. I didn’t like the way the jacket fit so I opted to wear a shirt under it."
3.0,The product was like the photo except I was expecting much larger stones!
3.0,Alot smaller than stated size
3.0,"I suppose the dimensions that they put seem accurate, but the model photos show a much larger bag. I don't mind it because I'm used to having small purses and didn't care much about the size, but it's definitely NOT a tote bag. The bow also doesn't come attacked to the bag, it's just a lace ribbon that you tie on yourself, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to tie it to in order to make it look like the picture. It's cute and doesn't seem like bad quality for a pvc bag, the photos are just a little misleading."
3.0,Cheap alternative to overpriced Pandora charms.  It is just as expected w/o paying for the overpriced Pandora charms.  Looks great and you nobody would know its not Pandora.
3.0,All the the bracelets are super cute. But the gold is so gold that it looks super fake.
3.0,The shirt was WAY bigger than I thought it was going to be and the material was weird and noisy? I'm going to have it hemmed because I love the design and I'll have to order a size WAY smaller next time though.
3.0,Wished it was 1.5 larger
3.0,A bit loose at waist area
3.0,"Overall they fit me, but very short. Not very good to wear as an undershirt, and they ride up so I constantly have to pull them back down."
3.0,"The boots are very comfortable but they are NOT leather, they are plastic."
3.0,The front pocket fits normal sized things. The main pocket is too narrow for most things. It's a lot of work to pull anything out of it while you're wearing it. Wish I would have gone with a less narrow option.
3.0,It was ruined after 1 wash. Somehow it looks like it was sprayed with oil? Like it has dotted discoloration all over it.<br /><br />But the size is great.
3.0,"This is a mixed review:<br /><br />Pro: the earrings are really beautiful. They seem well made and look expensive.<br />Con: wrong color metal. The photo on Amazon shows gold metal. The earrings I received is silver. Luckily, it does not really matter for my outfit, but I would have preferred the gold."
3.0,"It is a good looking watch, heavy not like a cheaply made watch but the gold hands On a gold face makes it very hard to see the time"
3.0,"I love the side pockets.  They hold my larger Moto Z Droid comfortably.  They also have a back pocket.  What I don't like about them is that the hem is too tight on my calf.  If the fit was little looser there, it would be great."
3.0,Cute shirt but runs a lot bigger than the size chart says. Will be returning.
3.0,Strap keep falling off
3.0,Right when you open the box you get a strong smell of plastic. I also wasn't able to gift these since they didn't come in a box but in a clear plastic bag.
3.0,Nice hat and nice that it had an adjustable strap rather than cheap plastic adjustable holes.
3.0,So pretty but definitely runs small as other reviewers stated. I’m smaller chested and was able to add a slip to make it less revealing. I’m normally a large and bought an extra large. I’m 5’9 180 for reference.
3.0,"This is a nice enough looking basic long sleeve tee.  The material is very soft and is very lightweight.  It definitely runs small.  Ordered in my regular size but can't wear it.  If you get it, size up.  Overall a decent tee - not bad not great - but iffy sizing."
3.0,I love the necklace. Only 3 stars because it discolored.
3.0,I really like this but the buttons are too spaced apart. Would prefer a zipper in front.
3.0,"This was a beautiful chain.  Unfortunately,  after wearing one of them just a couple times, the jump ring that holds the clasp together separated and the chain came off in my hand."
3.0,I'm 5'5&#34; and these were short on me.
3.0,"Be sure to pay attention to the word velvet next to the pants you order!!!!! I think the pants would have been great if they were not a half an inch thick. The color was nice and so was the material, but i could'nt wear them due to the fact that I would have sweat to death. I missed the time frame of sending them back. I would possibly try the other pairs BUT WILL MAKE SURE TO CHOOSE THE NON VELVET OPTION."
3.0,My husband LOVES body glove socks! He wears them out. Unfortunately these are not as good as quality as the ones we bought at the store. Makes me wonder if they are knock offs.  Sadly they fall apart quicker than the ones he has had for years.
3.0,Size runs big.  Price is a bit high for the quality.  Will be nice in the winter as a wearable blanket.  Warm.
3.0,this wallet is huge way too big for me.
3.0,The mask kept falling down on my 5 year old. I tried one and had the same problem. Love the colors though
3.0,"Cute idea, runs small in the chest. Really bummed cuz it's a great looking design"
3.0,"I did not know the top part of the dress was like a wrap style and was not fully closed. I have a 36D bust and the top of the dress gaped wide open and it was not a good look. If I went up a size (to compensate for the bust) I feel the dress as a whole would fit to big and loose. I guess I need to figure out a way to keep the bust closed. I’m 5’7” with long legs and the dress did not hit at my knees as stated, it was at least 4” above my knees. It is a really nice dress, but I wish the top part of the dress did not have an opening like it does."
3.0,For the price I could have bought a lot more earrings. You just about have to use a magnifier to see the diamonds. The only reason I did not return them is because the wife likes them. But I am not happy!
3.0,Chinsy and too small for an adult.  Cheshire cat's tail is way fluffier.
3.0,"The fabric is stiff, rough, and a bit loud. Perhaps that will get better after it's washed. A little tight around my arms but a bit too billowy around the middle. Don't know if I'll keep it or not since I only paid about $7 for two of them."
3.0,These are great but it came with 9 in the pack instead of 10. I couldn’t figure out how to get in touch with company to get the pair I’m missing. I didn’t want to return to amazon because I need them for a party. Would have been 5 stars if I weren’t missing a pair.
3.0,"This should come with a warning for the expected wrist size. My wife has what I would describe as normal wrists, and this is too long to fit the Apple Watch comfortably against her skin, which causes measurement problems (physical activity), and locks the watch often. Additional perforations to the band won't necessarily solve this (and it will look horrible, as I do not have professional equipment)."
3.0,"I chose this costume for my husband to wear on Halloween. The costume only brings the vest, collar and head part. It does not bring the white gloves, black pants or shoes. The quality of the vest and collar were of cheap quality. The head of Jack is very disappointing. The texture is of cheap quality and it comes with too many dents. No matter what you stuff it with to try and remove these dents, nothing works. I was planning to return this item, but with everything that happened with hurricane Sandy. I simply forgot to..."
3.0,"I'm so bummed about these pants. Granted, I probably should have ordered a size or two up, but I still don't think they would have fit even if I had. They are literally so skinny at the thighs and waist! They also do not stretch at all, and the zipper is on the side, It looks like its on the back in the photo. All in all, these were disappointing, unless you have a thigh gap like a flamingo."
3.0,Cute idea but was looking for it to be more fitted
3.0,"The material does feel nice against the skin, but it does not lift or provide support, instead it squishes the breast down. I tried every level of the hooks, and it made no difference. If you are large breasted and need lift and support, this bra is NOT for you. Will be sending this back."
3.0,The dress was very cute but I cannot do staticky material. I tried it on and it stuck to me everywhere.
3.0,"Nice jumpsuit. I always order a size up when I order off brands from Amazon. You would need to purchase your own belt to set the jumpsuit off like the picture. It is definitely needed. My only grip is that it is completely see-through, as most of the items from these type of sellers. I have to wear a full black bodysuit with it to make it look intentional or else you can’t wear any undergarments with it."
3.0,"Nice material and an overall cute swimsuit. Bummed it didn't fit properly in the chest area, almost seemed stretched out."
3.0,"Los compre para obsequiar , pero en la imagen se van más grandes de lo que enrealidad son, pero están ok"
3.0,A touch too snug
3.0,"I got this Michael Kors purse in the mail yesterday and it is Not the same as in the picture, really not that satisfied. ☹️"
3.0,It's just ok. I don't think I like the color but I may wear it. It's kinda baggy too.
3.0,It's pretty but a little snug. Not sure if I'm going to keep it.
3.0,A lot Smaller then pictured very delicate chain. Packaging was very nice. Would of given 4 Stars if it chain was thicker. Nice gift for child or teenager.
3.0,"Fist of all I usually wear a 10 2E or 10W shoe. Because these boots are Medium fit I went with 10.5 size boots. They are too big. I had to buy insoles and heavy socks to make them fit better. Second the outsoles are to thin as you can feel the rocks when you step on them. The extra cushioning insoles helped a little to make them less noticeable. Dont walk on pavement with these shoes as the rubber ridges and knobs on the outsoles will wear down rather quickly. The loop on the back of the shoe to help pull them on is barely large enough to get your finger thru it. So by the time you have spent the extra money for heavy socks and insoles, you would be better off to pay a little more upfront for a better boot. Overall I would give these a 3.5 rating at best."
3.0,It says shiny but it was very dull almost tarnished and way smaller than pictured. It's heavy not chunky theres a difference.
3.0,Fits tight and I bought it a size bigger than my size?  Very dissapointed that it did not fit as it should.
3.0,"too big for a necklace, but cute, so I'm making a pin out of it"
3.0,For a sweatshirt material was thin. Liked the shoes design but felt like thin plastic.
3.0,The costume was smaller.  Definitely not one size<br />The hat was no really usable as it was bent.
3.0,Not so much real stiff and I can not use it donate
3.0,"these are cute, but cheaply made. the part that goes between your toes needs to be farther out or buy a size larger.<br />I'm hoping they stretch out a little."
3.0,The product is ok but the original price is for sure overpriced. I paid $36 with the discount and it if fair enough but not great. For sure the value of the item is not $77. The strap is pretty much a cheap shoe lace. It looks bad so I will use the purse without it.
3.0,"Definitely not a tummy control leggings as the description says. The fabric is super soft, super fine hosiery material and it doesn’t give any compression anywhere. They are definitely super soft and may go with the tunics but they look odd when wearing with t-shirts as the leggings show all the cellulite 😬. I would use them at home and as night pjs."
3.0,"It’s comfy but not a good sports bra, better as a sleeping bra."
3.0,"Anklet is very light and doesn't fit either of my ankles. It would be a good idea to note the size somewhere in the ad. I will probably have the anklet made into a bracelet for my granddaughter. I was very disappointed with the sizing, and if I return it.you have nothing else that I liked."
3.0,"I bought this a few months ago and didn't think to write a review. It's not a great robe. It runs a smidge small in the hips. But it's not a terrible robe - it has pockets, stays tied, and isn't see through. Overall, I feel like it serves its purpose. Its purpose, for me, is to have something to wear after I get out of the shower and need to do my hair and makeup.<br /><br />Today, I took a shower, got out and moisturized my whole body with lotion and body oil, then laid down on my bed with white sheets while finishing up some work on my laptop. When I got up, I noticed that my white sheets and pillowcase have a weird purplish black stain on them that wasn't there before I laid down. I figured out that it's the dye on the robe. Somehow the lotion or oil from my body mixed with the dye in the robe and have stained my sheets purple. I have my sheets soaking right now but am fearful I won't be able to get the stains out - these are favorite set of 1000 TC sheets and I fear that they are completely ruined. I am so disappointed.<br /><br />My advice to others would be to perhaps wash the robe in hot water prior to wearing it (though I am not sure that would make a difference) and to be careful about laying down with the robe on. Don't make the same mistake that I did. :-("
3.0,Thin ply material great for warm weather use. Not as much flare when wearing it. Photo makes it look more like a mini dress tunic but unfortunately it doesn't flatter the way other tunics do.
3.0,"I find these to be slightly uncomfortable, and would not like to wear them for an extended period of time. However, they work perfectly if you plan to wear them around a locker room, a pool, or anywhere else that you just want to cheaply put something between your feet and the ground."
3.0,Flimsy but does what I need them too.
3.0,feels like Merkle worn this shirt.
3.0,Fits me great and I wear it a lot.
3.0,I like it but a bit big for my taste
3.0,they look kinda cheapy
3.0,It was smaller than the picture and you got to keep fixing the time but he loved the color
3.0,"Cheap fabric, looks like sweats for babies."
3.0,"This hat is so cute, but so small.  The red color is vibrant, and the flower and band around the hat add to its charm.  Four of us adult women tried this hat on, and it didn't fit any of us comfortably, so we're thinking it would be perfect for a 12- to 15-year-old.  I was going to return the hat, but 'tis the season, and it will make a lovely gift or donation."
3.0,"This dress is a lightweight, flannel like material, perfect for cooler weather. The bust, sleeves, and waist fit like a glove. BUT..... The arm openings are even with the bust. My armpit area is a good 3 inches higher than my bustline... This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to lift one's arms...AT ALL. Shoulders and breasts do not reside on the same plane!!!<br />I paid $5 after discount for this dress. It would be cost prohibitive to return and frankly everything else about this dress is great..so i am going to remove the sleeves and finish the edges...( I am 42-32-41 5'7&#34; and i bought an XL. I hope this helps. Length is just past my knees.)"
3.0,Returned as too heavy but I liked it.
3.0,"I’m only 5’ 3” and felt it was too short in the front. It cuts you off at the wrong place. It looks odd, the back is also too long."
3.0,Yore before I wore it. Like it wasn't sewn tight.
3.0,most of these were too small for my neck
3.0,Tamaño Justo a la talla
3.0,I need to lose weight in order to look right in it.
3.0,Not HIGH WAISTED.  Didn't  fit correctly
3.0,"I like the look of this sweater. it does look like the photographs in the listing, with the heart having a slightly textured appearance that resembles (but isn't actually) a woven knit. The heart is a little bit oddly shaped across the chest. The bottom of the sweater does have a thick band that holds title to the body, which you can see in the listing pictures. I like this feature, otherwise the sweater would look too loose. I did find, however it that the sweater had way too much material in the back. When I made it look cute in the front there was all of this additional material bunching in the back of the sweater. It just feels overall too large in some places, although the sleeves were the right length, causing me to believe the cut of the pattern is a bit off. It's wearable, but I wish it hung better. I'm 5'4, 115-120lbs, and ordered a small."
3.0,Descent product for the price. Material is very thin and breathable. I ordered a Large but feels somewhere between a Medium and Large fit. These will definitely outline your junk therefore I try not to wear them in public
3.0,I guess you need pretty specific size ears. I'd love to bend it into shape but it's a cheap metal and I fear it will break.
3.0,All in all cute shirt with one exception the shirt is short not long like the picture shows
3.0,This seemed like a really cool purse....but there is the center zipper pocket but it doesn't have the 2 organizer pockets on the inside which is something I utilize all the time.
3.0,"The ring is very comfortable, my only complaint is that after a day or two of use my skin turns all white and wet under it.  Like when you soak in the tub too long.  Unlike a traditional ring this needs some airing out of the skin."
3.0,"Runs small, but thankfully I lost weight and am able to fit into it now. At the time I ordered I weighed over 200lbs. Now I’m at 185 and it fits well."
3.0,"I think it will be ok with a little primping and combing, but the bangs are a little funny and flat. But, if your order a wig for $7.95 on Amazon, you can't really expect a fantastic quality wig! I got what I paid for, and it was still a good deal."
3.0,I ordered based off the sizing chart and got a 4XL for my 33inch waist. OMG - this skirt is YUGE! I would have to take it in by almost 4 inches to have it sit properly at my waist. I'm super crushed because I wanted to wear this tomorrow night and I don't have enough time to order a replacement. The material actually has a tiny bit of give and the pockets are deep. Perfect dressy maxi skirt (looks better with a petticoat IMO) just size down!
3.0,"The earplugs stay in better than traditional earplugs, but they do not cancel enough noise, nor are they very comfortable."
3.0,"Dress was super thin, recommend sizing up. I normally wear a medium,  I returned and was reimbursed"
3.0,"My skirt arrived today and I was disappointed because the background color of the Botanical  print is more tan versus white. From the Amazon photos and the RipSkirt website, they all looked white...<br />I am going to ask the folks at Ripskirt about what the true color should be. It does not look like the bright vibrant  print that I was expecting for summer.…..and am not able to wear it with a white tee shirt as expected.<br />The size is as expected, I have three of these skirts already in all lengths and really enjoy them for vacation and after my water aerobics classes."
3.0,Bought this watch for Christmas and it looked and work great but now it's no longer keeping time
3.0,It was alright i guess
3.0,I took a while before writing this review because I wanted to give this pair a fair chance. My reasons for my 3 star rating: the fit is awkward - slightly large but very tight around the ankle. I wore these several times over extended periods of time. They were not the most comfortable. The sole is very thin and uneven. Since they were super cheap I kept them.
3.0,The blackband showing through the roses does not show as well it does in the picture
3.0,"Runs large, but is made out of good material"
3.0,Great buy but I received an incomplete order missing two wristlets and one bottle holder 🤦‍♀️
3.0,"My son put these on right away and after an hour, we had noticed the color had slightly faded due to the accordion type style of the socks. I guess when you stretch the socks, the picture becomes stretched. He still wears them bc he likes fnaf so much."
3.0,"Night shirt is cute, but the XL I ordered is more like a Medium."
3.0,I bought this hat for my 4 year old to use as a sleep hat and it fits him perfectly. It's soft and very lightweight.
3.0,"Love the colors, ran way to big but I feel like if it fit it still doesn't have enough support. Better fit for smaller breasts I'm sure."
3.0,a little larger than I thought
3.0,What i needed but any smaller and it wouldn't fit. I am not a big girl either.
3.0,El producto no es igual a la imagen
3.0,I had to reshape them a few times but they worked pretty well overall
3.0,"I got this for Christmas and while this shirt itself is awesome, it runs VERY small! I'm a 10/12 and got a large, it was skin tight. I prefer my t-shirts fitted, not loose or baggy and this was tiny! I would say it runs 1-2 sizes small."
3.0,Not as pictured its a representation of this dress fabric is a nice color it might look nice if you are a woman with 12 year old child body. Not for formed females with any kind of female parts
3.0,My daughter likes them.
3.0,"I thought it was going to be a bigger bag. Personally, I like large bags and this is more on the small/medium side."
3.0,These are a bit tight around my thighs and the fabric is different to what I expected. It’s not very stretchy and is less like legging material.
3.0,Made jewelry with these findins
3.0,"This is a very warm sweater, but too big and unflattering.  I still wear it around the house with sweatpants because it’s warm and cozy, but I don’t like the way it sits on my body.  Makes me feel huge even though I’m not."
3.0,These are pretty cute. I just wish they were more purple than green tinged. My pair came and they have a strong green cast to them.
3.0,the pjs are super cute but the top runs extremely big. The top does have the adjuster things on them so you can adjust the straps but it still fits very loose for my personal liking.
3.0,Just did t look right.  Cute though.
3.0,It didn't as good as on the picture.
3.0,"Nice pants for work, wish they were softer."
3.0,"I like the color and overall construction of this bra, but had to return the one that arrived. Perhaps the company changed their sizing recently, or maybe the item I received was mislabeled at the factory. While the band on this ""Josephine"" bra fits just fine, the cups seem FAR smaller than they should be for an F cup (DDD) bra, and feel more like a large C or small single-D cup!  No amount of strap adjustment, nor repositioning via shaking/shimmying/scooping, helped the situation-- the cups are just way too small, causing the dreaded over-spillage on top with a dent in the middle.<br /><br />This brand is normally well worth the cost. I bought another unlined Rosa Faia bra in this exact size (40F) in the ""Alicia"" style a number of years ago for about $75, and I love it ( https://www.amazon.com/Rosa-Faia-Anita-Womens-Seamless/dp/B0034G6600 )  The Alicia is very comfortable, fits perfectly, and has maintained its structure -- unlike so many other bras these days that fall apart within less than a year. The only reason I ordered this Josephine style is that I can't find a seller for the Alicia in my cup size anymore.<br /><br />I don't normally mind bra cups that are not stretchy, because in some ways less stretch provides better support and a longer-lasting garment. But if the material has no stretch, the cups have to fit correctly from the start. And although individual styles and brands of bra can vary, it is rare that I have to go up or down more than one cup size *within the same brand.* Even across the various other brands I own, they all run between 38 and 40 on the band size, and between E and F in the cup. The tag on my Alicia bra says it was manufactured in Portugal, while the tag on this this new Josephine bra says it was manufactured in Thailand, so maybe switching factories has also caused a change in quality control.<br /><br />I might try to order another of this Josephine style, maybe jumping right to 40H, but first I'm waiting to see if a different Rosa Faia non-stretch style (""Scarlett"" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AA7UOYK/ ) ordered with a G cup has the same problem. It's difficult to find bras in any color besides white, black, and beige in these larger cups sizes, so I was really looking forward to this light blue Josephine bra and the purple Scarlett one."
3.0,We had this for about 2 months & the zipper broke.
3.0,"Alkward face , just a little big for my taste"
3.0,"Quality seems pretty good, and fits great (loose and comfy), but I ordered the red/coffee... it's just coffee, doesn't have the maroon color to it at all."
3.0,This is beautiful and has the perfect shimmer and glitz but it's too snaggy!!!
3.0,"I've always loved multi-layered bracelets that are connected to one another, but finding a good quality one is hard. This one, however, I believe would last quite awhile before coming undone or even breaking.<br /><br />What I noticed first when I put the bracelet on was that it tightens really well around the wrist; bracelets like these usually don't tighten completely -  leaving an uncomfortable gap that makes it feel like the bracelet is going to fall off after a few wears. I was also glad that the tighten strings (the strings which hang on the back) were long enough that I didn't have to use my teeth to tighten the bracelet (which most of these types, I usually have to).<br /><br />The only setback about this bracelet is that after wearing it a few times, it began to get looser and not tightening enough to stay put on my wrist. And then I noticed some of the threading was coming out of the main part which holds all three pieces together. So, this is a good bracelet for certain occasions, but not every day wear, which was disappointing because I do love the look of this bracelet."
3.0,"I tried the suit on once went on great , I tried to take it off and the seam is already ripping, it's also very see through 😅 luckily I'm a seamstress and can fix it, but yea you get what you pay for"
3.0,Bought them in a xxl which is bigger then I normally take  to start (I usually wear a large to a Clarke) and when trying it on it was like trying to put your panties on when your bodies wet. It rolls all up your body and your having everything you can do to get it over the added rolls you inherited from country kitchen during this isolation from COVID. I Would definitely get at least 2 times a bigger size in hopes to fit.
3.0,Good quality and arrival time. It's just kind of small for a size of extra large . I'm an average sized woman by the way
3.0,Probably good for the beach or pool if you plan to get it wet. Otherwise I recommemd you choose a different one. Odd fit. Flimsy material. Catches wind. I found more quality visors on amazon for the same price.
3.0,"Lovely colors on this one!  Although be very cautious on the &#34;one size&#34; description.  As a dress, this might fit someone around a size 4-6 and 5' tall or less.  At 5'2&#34; and a street size 10-12, this thing fits like a bodycon tunic.  I wore it with capris and got compliments on it as a tight fitting tunic, but would never try to pull this off as a dress, and it is far too snug for a bathing suit coverup.  It's VERY stretchy, but shows every bump and grind!<br /><br />I got this item at a discount for an honest review.  I'm a long time Amazon shopper and depend on reviews to make decisions on my purchases."
3.0,"Kind of itchy on my skin,wore it only one time"
3.0,"It’s kind of cheap but I should have known that, based on the price."
3.0,Really cute but thought would be warmer
3.0,with the black stockings one was 5&#34;longer than the other.
3.0,"This is fairly well-made, however the class is so small that it’s nearly impossible to use."
3.0,Plastic material and it keeps riding up my legs
3.0,Superb workmanship but fit was way too big. Seller offered to let me keep it to donate to one who could use it and refund my money but I don’t know how to take advantage of the kind and generous offer.
3.0,I could barely get it over my hips but it fit my waist fine.  Needs more stretch in the waist band.  I was disappointed in the color and found there was just too much fabric in the legs for palazzo pants for me.  I've returned it.
3.0,"A bit thin, wished it was longer/only comes 1/2 way up my leg"
3.0,Difficult to see out of.
3.0,Material feels cheap but it’s lightweight so there’s that
3.0,Picture is much better than real one. It looks rough
3.0,"Fit some ties, others, not so much."
3.0,Wish it fit tighter around the belly.
3.0,"Its all just kind of... Okay. The fabric is ok, the print makes it a little stiff. Its a tiny bit big, but mostly true to size. A bit short in the back for someone taller. It makes me feel a bit frumpy because there is extra fabric on the sides. Which then makes it hang longer and a bit oddly on said sides, because I am not a pear shape. I would have preferred that fabric to be spread more evenly around the dress, or have no panel side panels and just have a true t-shirt dress. Its comfortable enough, so I'll keep it for a beach cover or sleep shirt."
3.0,"In most of the reviews, people say that this runs small. It definitely is not true.<br />I ordered a medium. I'm 5'6&#34; and 132. The medium is way big on me and it's super stretchy. I probably could have fit into an xtra small."
3.0,"Luckily for me my wrist seems to be in between the sizes. 1st one too tight, 2nd too lose & has become annoying at times. Always having to shake arm while raised so it'll slide back from the lower wrist. When I'm on the laptop my wrist wants to rest on top of it becasue it's a little too big & sags more than it should.<br />Silver was too shiny for me & The black is also too shiny for me. The black shinyness dulls with wear. I've had it roughly 2 mths & I don't wear it all the time. Scratches easily but not totally obvious."
3.0,Definately not one size fits all. Not even fits most. I am a size L and it won't fit me.
3.0,"The band was too tight, but everything else fit well"
3.0,Love the belt. However I haven’t had very long and the Sri thing that holds the belts together is coming apart.
3.0,it’s designed more like a girl shirt than a boys. It’s ok.
3.0,"It was pretty, but it was just too short for me.  I am 5'2"" and it was well above my knee.  Okay for a young person I guess, but not for a 60 year old woman.  I returned the dress."
3.0,"I truly don't know what I was expecting, material is thicker than I thought it would be.  I guess I would recommend."
3.0,A little too small. Got for 3-5 year old. Cute socks
3.0,Un guanto esta roto
3.0,"The delivery was prompt and the product nicely wrapped. The glove lining is not stitched together, but rather simply attached at the wrist opening and loose from there. This makes it difficult to comfortably put the gloves on and to remove them."
3.0,got lots of compliments on these and they are light enough they don't pull on my ears
3.0,It's beautiful but I've never wear it since I bought it!  Cause is too small for me
3.0,Runs very small. Logo is very faded and can barely see
3.0,it's very heavy and is pretty but the metal looks oxidized in places it is not suppose to be.
3.0,I love them but this one didn’t come with a ball :(
3.0,I was expecting a soft cotton scarf material and this was a cheap silk like material that has a horrible odor to it. After spraying it with Fabreeze it worked well.
3.0,"Just letting anyone know, that pretty subtle (and classy) yellow?  NOT.  Lime green and tacky.  I know, IMO!!  Returned, never tried on."
3.0,It's okay. Could fit better going around neck
3.0,"Ok I like the design. But the cons, then band is way to long for me. And one side pops off with the lightest bump. I went back to other band sincr it stays on way better."
3.0,"Seemed nice enough but it was way too big. I usually wear a medium, however after reading several of the reviews I went with a large.<br />For reference I'm 5'6"" about 145#, a 36 B/C and have an athletic build.  To be honest I'm thinking a medium may have been loose, as well, given how huge the large was.  I did like the look and color, seemed like decent material but I returned it outright since I needed it for a trip."
3.0,Top was really cute. Bottoms were not the green shown but more of an aqua blue.
3.0,"Very cute top. I ordered a large and medium. Ended up keeping the medium. As other reviewers mentioned, the buttons are just for show so you will have to pull it over your head. Because I’ll be wearing this as a shirt and not jacket, I sized down. Be aware that this product does SHED! I tried to pair it with white/cream pants and I saw lint everywhere. I also found the strings in my carpet from just trying it on. The buttons are not secure but they do send you an extra one. I decided to keep this because it is very cute and different. Based on the cons, it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it given the price"
3.0,Good looking product but too small!!
3.0,The material is a lot more sheer than I thought... I bought for a wedding and was stressed out that you could see right through it...Even with a slip underneath
3.0,"I love the coat, but not the SHINY GOLD zipper. I sent it back."
3.0,It's off centered so it doesn't lay properly when you wear it.
3.0,Just okay. Too long for me will have to alter
3.0,"Off - these shorts look nice. The material is nice and slick, like bathing suit material should be. I noticed there wasn't any elasticity in the material like there is my other swimwear shorts. Was awfully hard getting the sewn in panties right way around to put them on. Finally got them on and was immediately disappointed in the fit. I have recently gone down a size and all my other clothes of that size fit, these look like they are another size too small. Especially right around my lower thigh. There's absolutely no give to these shorts."
3.0,I think this is supposed to be a child size...?
3.0,😒😒
3.0,I like the material and the style but they run a bit small
3.0,"Cute dress, but too small"
3.0,I’m a medium and it runs small. I like to wear a tank top or thin shirt underneath so the medium was too small. Material feels great and thick. Because of the size I had to return it.
3.0,I love the style of these shoes except they were too small. :/
3.0,"These look really cute, but I wasn't satisfied when I got them. I didn't think I would need to order bigger (which they don't come larger than just a large). They're smaller than I expected and the lace is easily ripped. I do really enjoy the silky fabric though. The colors are also very amazing!"
3.0,The red was not red.  Disappointed.  Frame was good.
3.0,It's cute but wish I had sized up<br />Not the kind of material that I can stretch out<br />More clingy<br />I got xl<br />Wish I had gone XXL but i like my tops looser
3.0,The dress is absolutely gorgeous in the display but it isn’t like that in person. I am on the smaller side so perhaps that’s why it wasn’t really flattering to me. I normally wear a medium but I wanted a tight dress so I went down in size. It didn’t help. Still kind of pretty.
3.0,"This romper is adorable. The fabric is pretty thin but it's for summer so who cares? The issue is the sizing. My boys', who are normal sized twins, thighs can't fit in these suckers. Shame.. they're very cute!"
3.0,Decorative disc fell out of earring within the first 2 hours of wear.  Send me a replacement disc?
3.0,"As the headline says the jacket fit PERFECTLY but the pants were like 3 sizes too small, my husband couldn't even button them. However, we really only needed a jacket anyway since he already had pants that worked fine, and for only $50 we were perfectly happy with the product. I think if they're going to sell them as a combo they need to rethink some of the sizing for the pants (52 inches is actually LARGER than what my husband normally wears but these pants didn't even come close to fitting) but again, $50 was an incredibly fair price for the jacket alone so we were fine with it."
3.0,Fun but breaks easily
3.0,"This product is ok.  There is no such thing as one size fits all compression hose.  This product has a light compression. It is easy to put on, and stays up well. The feet are way too big and long. Iam petite in size.  I will use the hose at night  during sleep, but I will not be buying this product again."
3.0,"This shirt is way smaller than you think.  It's cute, the material is okay, and the price is very reasonable, but way way way to small."
3.0,"Order at least a half size up. Other than that, they're about what you'd expect for a shoe of this price. I bought these for grandkids to wear on rocky/sandy beaches, and in the boat. Easy to throw in the washer when they get too dirty. I don't think these will last longer than 3 months, but that's ok given the price."
3.0,"In my honest Opinion, these glasses due help with visual clarity. For instance I have difficulty with depth perception and that problem is 3x more difficult in the dark. I have found these glasses do give me clarity in the distance between myself and oncoming traffic. I can also see road markings and lines better. If you are purchasing these to help with glare of lights, I would say they are just ok. I still get quite a bit of glare, although that has diminished just a tad since using the glasses. However they did not diminish the glare enough to purchase these solely for that purpose.<br /><br />Disclaimer: My review is based on my visual condition only. Although I feel these glasses have helped my depth perception and provide more visual clarity, it is not a guarantee that this will be the case for everyone."
3.0,"The bracelet itself came in great condition and its really pretty. The only down side is the the hand is way too big! I just wish the hand could have been smaller would have looked better with the beads! Also, the chain part to adjust the sizing is useless because the bracelet is stretchable, plus it started to turn green."
3.0,Fits well and works
3.0,"They are good for the price. Not as good as maxi flex but for the price, you can't beat it."
3.0,Gave it away because it wasn't what I expected.
3.0,"My partner had purchased me a pair of similar earrings back in January that were, well, huge.  I thought I'd look like some ridiculous thug wannabe but they actually looked pretty cool on me until the backs just mysteriously fell off within days of each other.  I purchased these to replace them and although they're very nice looking and they did give dimensions in the description, they are WAY smaller than I had anticipated.  Not their fault.  I didn't really think about the size in mm vs. carats.  So they're nice, just expect small when you receive them."
3.0,"The belt accessory broke immediately taking it out of the packaging. Luckily, I've a nicer one that's similar. The colors are nice and the fit it as expected. It's a lovely summer romp around dress. I've decided to keep it."
3.0,"It is ok, we bought for a barn themed wedding and it suited that purpose, but not overly impressed. The pockets are decorative, it doesn't really button, those are decorative as well. It is cute, but doesn't seem very durable."
3.0,"Very cute and I get lots of compliments, but I do have a bit of a reaction to it.  Thats what I get for buying cheap jewelry I guess."
3.0,"It’s a nice bag that seems well made but it is on the smaller side. My daughter needed a track bag that could hold warm clothing items like a hoodie, sweatpants, hat, gloves, as well as her spikes, phone, water bottle, snacks, etc. This just didn’t work for us for it…but it was cheap enough that we will keep it to use for something else."
3.0,"This is a hard review for me, a rarity, because this truly is really really good and really really bad, all at the same time.<br /><br />First to the sizing. I am a straight large in PJs. I often wear a medium, but I prefer things a bit looser and I always get large in my pajamas. These were Extra Large, full on extra large, and they fit like a large and were a bit binding in the delicate area in the pants. The shirt was lovely, as to sizing, but the pants were cut a bit short in the area where we don't want them to be too high.<br /><br />Second, I found a fabric issue that makes no sense to me. The silk is unevenly woven. It's thinner and then thicker, all throughout. This is an easy thing to test for. You can feel it when running fingers over both sides of a piece of fabric, if you are accustomed to running this test as I am, but you can also see it by holding it up to the light and simply looking at the weave of the fabric. Huge sections were very very very thin while other sections were nice and thick.<br /><br />But then, at the same time, these are very well sewn, well stitched, and the fabric still has a higher weight than the competition I tested. Also, the pajamas do fully contain the elastic portion within the waistband, so they are nonirritating. The length of the arms and pant legs are a bit long on a shorter person and a bit short on a taller person, as expected, while the competition I tested had very long arms, far too long, so they use a good average measurement on these as to leg and arm length. Finally, in the plus column, is the fact of the piping detail which is thick and well done and very secure throughout the shirt and pants.<br /><br />Overall, this has some really great details, really great quality details, which make me love this set of PJs, but then it also has serious flaws. I bought another pair and received the wrong size, so I couldn't test that pair the same way, but it was purchased to test the fabric and it was also thick and then thin, all throughout the garment, and had issues with slight shortness in the waist-level leading to it cutting too close in the delicate area of the pants.<br /><br />As a woman who generally has no issue with pants feeling too tight, I just wasn't comfortable with how close these felt and I would recommend that anyone trying these size up by one size to start, but possibly two sizes, unless you are short-waisted or have a very tiny behind and very tiny thighs. I would describe the size large as perfect for my friend who tried them. She is 130 pounds and 5'5'. I am 150 and 5'6' and the extra large felt too tight from below.<br /><br />Good luck in your search. I really struggled with this one, because it had specific great qualities going for it, but it also had key flaws that knocked it down and I ordered a second pair to be certain that I was right about it. Both pairs had the same issues with thickness being variable and with cutting too close in the pants, being too binding. I did only test the black, so I can't attest to the fabric in other colorways and I tested from the same original batch when it was a new product, so they may fix this issue later on. I'm hoping they will fix it, because the quality was so lovely otherwise."
3.0,"Cute, but bling does not last very long as beads start falling off as soon as you start wearing band."
3.0,Arrived incredibly late and the fabric seems to be different shades of pink. Wouldn’t recommend
3.0,"It looks great and fits well lengthwise, but it very tight in the chest area. It compresses a LOT. Its hard to move my upper arms at times. I can pass as a prepubescent teen, but it looks nice when I go to the temple and other festivals."
3.0,"Just OK, kind of small, and image is only on one side of the coin. Still, it looks pretty good though does not appear as golden as in the films.<br /><br />Expensive for what it is.<br /><br />I would give five stars to the seller, excellent service: arrived on time, securely packaged."
3.0,Does its job.  It's not very silent so I can hear it when it comes on; so you may want to put it not near the bed or even the bedroom.  The holders are cheaply made but does the job!
3.0,I saw these pants in a  tourist store and they fit...but were way marked up in price.  I ordered them...same size and they are way too small. I gave 3 stars because of this uncertainty. ...but they are awesome pants and if I lose those 15 pounds by next spring...I will Rock these pants!
3.0,Just what can I say the price for the necklace and the quality is so so. Probably wouldn't be best for people w/ sensitive skin.
3.0,"Good quality but the sizes are wrong. I ordered 12mm and the ones I got are much smaller and ive already lost 1 side of most of the pairs because they just fall out of my ears, I can't wear them to work because sometimes they just fall out when im walking around and don't want it to end up in someones food."
3.0,Fit like a tight tee-shirt. A 3x should have been a little too big.
3.0,too tight around the neck. I had to get my scissors out
3.0,I wore this dress before overlooking it and I wish I didn't. I think this dress might have been worn. There were no tags which should've been my first clue and after wearing it a couple hrs I felt the left side of the dress and you know when you wash cotton after one or two washes you start to feel and see it little balls? I'm going to have to upload a picture later but that's what it felt like and looks like. Other than that I'm 8.5 months pregnant I ordered a large and it fit me nice. I would order from them again just make sure you overlook your clothing before wearing.
3.0,Not bad mask wasn’t like the picture but it’s who he wanted to be lol…the fabric feels good! And I wish the gloves had Knuckles but it’s ok I’ll add some later! … overall good for price.<br /><br />Son is 3 years old but he’s tall so I ordered a 5/6 and it’s almost a perfect fit!
3.0,"Disappointing. I don’t have a long torso and I am heavy in the chest (32gg). The shirt has elastic which hits just below my breasts. There is not pulling in the chest area but the open cut design means wearing a tank top underneath. The material is ok and the design is nice but I don’t know how I will wear this. It can’t really be pulled down to my belly button and I’m too old to sport a mid drift. I am seeking a tank dresss that I can wear underneath this, but that wasn’t the original goal."
3.0,Dress was cute and fabric quality decent but fit was awkward. I’m 5’4” and a thin 140lbs. 34” bust 29” waist and 41” hip. Medium was SNUG around the bum. But the bust was fairly big. I would not be comfortable wearing something this right to the office.
3.0,"This bag has a great mobile pull behind system, but for the times you need to carry, it is very heavy.  Also, it does not ride well on top of luggage when you are going thru the AP.  The bag looks sharp, but larger than I would like."
3.0,"I ordered an 18-24 months size and received a 2T. Plus side is it came much sooner than expected since it wasn't supposed to get here until the 2nd and it's not like the size is too small. Unsure of the fit since I have seen it runs small but bought it for a Christmas gift. Seems to be good quality. Also the one I received is black, not dark blue. Still cute though."
3.0,These leggings are a great value. The ankles bother me because they are not tight at the bottom. I had to fold them up otherwise they look kinda weird. The seam on the inside rubs weird also.
3.0,"Fits so cute but you have to have long legs, the tie was past my ankles :( I'm 5'3"
3.0,"This earring is so pretty and it's easy to get in, I knocked two stars off because it gets dull and dirty really quickly. I included pictures of the earring that I've been wearing for a few weeks compared to a new one out of the package. As well as individual pictures of a brand new one."
3.0,The material was deceiving when I opened the package. There didn't appear to be a description of the type of material and the material doesn't &#34;breath&#34;
3.0,"The color and length are perfect along with the fit, however the construction of the pockets cause the fabric to pull awkwardly and pucker."
3.0,Little small but it does fit
3.0,The chain is very long and non adjustable.
3.0,My daughter wears between 10 and 12 but I suggest that a size bigger like a 14 Wil be much better.
3.0,It's sexy I love it
3.0,"ordered Large, received a &#34;chinese large&#34; that is actually an american medium closer to Small in the shoulders and very spacious in abdominal area.<br />Its pretty warm, its waterproof But has 1 big flaw - the buttons are sewed to the jacket by hand and you can actually see the threads on the outside of the jacket as well as fivers coming out where the needle went. Why not use different buttons ???????"
3.0,Good quality denim. It's a little too close on the leg to my liking but otherwise it's a good pair of jeans.
3.0,If I didn’t have a code this would not have been a good value but I’m satisfied with the product for what I paid
3.0,The pattern on this top is quite pretty but the top is very large and swallowed me up.  I'm gifting it to someone who is a large-sized person.  Took a very long time to receive it as well.  Not pleased with the shipping time. Still it is a nice looking top but would be better for larger women.
3.0,"While comfortable to wear, the straps are adjustable. BUT the straps don't stay in the necessary position,loosen up and consequently the overalls sag, drop and don't fit."
3.0,"I’m 5’8 and the dress was much too short to wear, otherwise it was a cute dress but had to return it."
3.0,"I really wanted to like SYROKAN Women's Running Bra Racerback High Impact Sports Bra Wirefree Quick Dry Max Support. Was looking for reliable support for high impact training in 34 B, my regular size in bra. This bra is not comfortable. It squashes breasts and racerback adjustable straps are rather restrictive and drag the overlaying top up. You need assistance to put it on and do the hooks.  And the hooks themselves make it look like an ordinary underwear which is surprising provided that athletic tops now feature all sorts of slits, keyholes and other body showing arrangements on the back."
3.0,If you order this jacket I suggest ordering it 2 sizes larger than normal. I ordered a 2X for my husband and it fits like a L/XL.
3.0,"The purse is not bad , I wish they put a better zipper so it doesn't look cheap ."
3.0,Look great but did not last long (less than two weeks) under normal wear and tear.
3.0,"I really like them but the green, black and orange watches have a funny odor musty mildew smell weird I know because the other ones don't they keep good time and are definitely a conversation piece when my friends see them"
3.0,"I followed the measurement guidelines when choosing the size of this dress.  It worked out perfectly as it fit me great. The material was soft and stretchy.  Unfortunately, I had to return it as the lace on top wasn't sewn on the dress so it kept flopping down. Still I would've liked to keep this dress, but I'm no seamstress."
3.0,"OK product, you pay for what you get. We used it for a costume."
3.0,"I love the look of them, but they are more for play or even for kids. The side parts that go around your ear are a little short making it a bit uncomfortable after a while."
3.0,The dress itself was gorgeous and made of good quality but the sizing was off. I recommend to order up!
3.0,"...sadly, it's NOT one size fits all.  I believe this is designed for a child.When I stretched it out so that I could get it over my hand (and I have small hands), there were pretty noticeable gaps between the beads (it would have taken four more beads to make it look &#34;full&#34;).  I'll be keeping it until I can give it to my great niece, but I'll be ordering one for myself from somewhere else,"
3.0,"Did not cover my frames, returned them"
3.0,I bought this for my boyfriend and he likes it because the material inside is really soft also very warm but the logo wasn't what I was expecting. It is way too big compared to the picture displayed. I am a nitpicky kind of person so it just looked off putting to me :(
3.0,Cute for beach coverup but very very big
3.0,"Look very different from the presented photo shape and color completely different. I was upset, but I liked the blue color inside if you look at the sun."
3.0,Good backpack for the cost. Right size for what we need. Only downfall is that the strap is coming unstitched from the bottom of the bag  after only several uses with very little weight in the back.
3.0,simply ok
3.0,"I really like the look of this nose ring, sad that it left a green mark on my nose."
3.0,"The strap looks good and appears well made with reinforcements for the holes. The strap is sold as standard length,  but the last of the eight holes is a full inch from the end of the strap. So if you have an above average wrist circumference beware when using the strap lengths to calculate if this will fit. Had they made it one half inch longer then this would get five stars without hesitation."
3.0,Love it but snags easily
3.0,"It was for a present , but size 14 P too small !!<br />The jacket is beautiful!"
3.0,"Beautiful dress but the neckline is higher than expected, pretty much covered entire cleavage up to my collarbones( I will admit I have b cups maybe a more endowed person would have more luck) order a size larger"
3.0,The size descriptions are wrong.  They run smaller.
3.0,Very cheap! This will be ruined in a month
3.0,They're Okay.
3.0,"Well the socks fit just fine but I didn’t get the socks I ordered. I ordered the socks with a smiley face but the color block socks are what I received. I actually wanted these for my daughters Toms (Mary Jane style). They’re not really going to work out for my need, but I will keep them since I don’t feel like returning them and they fit anyway."
3.0,"The shoes were great.  My daughter loved them, but the charger didn't work.  We ended up using chargers we already had."
3.0,Beautiful but not as long as pictured. Also not made well. Has seam holes around the neckline that are difficult to fix or hide. Literally falling apart at the seams. A shame because it’s really pretty on and comfortable.
3.0,Purchased size as per size chart
3.0,"I purchased the Grey in size XL. I wear a size M-L in tops but there was only one review at the time recommending to upsize. The XL fit comfortably but I could possibly have also fit a size L. The jacket is more like a lightweight open front waterfall cardigan. The label says 100% Polyester and it feels like really thin soft suede, unlined. There is not a whole lot of excess fabric in the front so the ""waterfall"" is minimal with no collar around the back and sides of the neck. The back is straight cut and crop length, the front hangs slightly shorter than in the picture. The sleeves are loose fit, not snug at any point down the arm, and the cuffs sit at the wrist. Overall it's fairly basic but for the price I paid I'll keep it for casual wear. I bought it as an add-on item for less than $5 with free Prime shipping.<br /><br />Update: The label recommends to dry clean but I threw it in the wash with regular clothes. Cold wash, hot dryer, and it came out just fine. Very little shrinkage and it didn't damage the fabric at all."
3.0,"Product was not white, but with a tinge of pink. It’s slightly see through and the product is stretchy not of a quality material. I ordered a medium as I always wear and it is trur to size."
3.0,"It is expensive. However, my baby likes it."
3.0,"Nice quality, and lightweight. They are rather short in length"
3.0,"True to size, wear everyday or as dress up. I would not buy again, not thrilled about the material, looks nice but not well made won't last long"
3.0,its ok ..
3.0,"This dress is very thin, and there is no stretch to it. It's a cute style but there's really nothing to it. I could never imagine wearing this without a slip on, it's not lined at all. Probably needs to be dry cleaned because it will shrink for sure!"
3.0,I don't like the padding on the boob. I have large press and the padding looks stupid. The arm is a little too big. But it's a gorgeous dress. I couldn't wear it to the wedding because cleavege area was too big. Womp womp.
3.0,This dress is beautiful (I ordered two).  It does have some drawbacks though.  It runs incredibly small.  The crisscrossed straps made it hard to get over the child’s head.  I had to get both dresses altered to remove the crisscross and attach the straps straight.  This gave more room in the bodice area and made it way easier to put on.
3.0,Not what I  was inspecting  but it's OK
3.0,The back dosen't slide on so easy and chips some of the color off the post. Also the pink and gold are the same color. It's hard to tell them apart.
3.0,It was much bigger than i expected it to be but she loves wearing it and will grow into it.
3.0,"I have purchased this previously, but the one that I recently bought, the top strap that goes across the right leg does not work. Therefore, I not able to get the full support of having it tight on the right side of my leg, very unfortunate."
3.0,the  hat over is  cool.  The white  backing arrived all wrinkled. not sure if they was the intention but he packaging arrived a bit squashed or is it the style. I am not  sure  but I will keep the hat.
3.0,"This dress is okay! Not my favorite, not my least favorite. I’m a reporter, 5’10, ~125 pounds and it’s appropriate for work and looks decent on camera"
3.0,"While the design of the pendant is pretty, there is slight irregularity/wavy texture to one segment of the cross' shiny finish/polish. also the snake chain that it came with is not the usual round snake chain, it's a very flat version of a snake chain but still looks fine. & the actual size of the pendant is much larger than what's specified on the description of width 1.9cm X length 4cm, I measured the pendant to be 2.9cm X 5.1cm! (the cross itself without the bail & loop is 2.9cm X 4cm).  this larger size can be a plus or con depending on your preference but if I would have known the actual size, I would not have purchased as I prefer a smaller pendant."
3.0,This item is okay. It's not baggy like the picture and it took over a month to ship. It's quality is actually a lot better than I anticipared. You can't beat it for $12!
3.0,Not for someone with a bosom. The material hung weird and it was much too narrow at the top. Didn't sit right. Probably best for someone who's flat chested.
3.0,"Not bad, I think I needed more padding."
3.0,They are just too long...tall...high....IDK but they come way up over my knee!!! by like 4 inches or so.<br />The material is thick. It's tight. Not too tight. Instantly feels energizing. I'm on my feet all day. I wish they didn't go over the knee and up my thigh. That's my only complaint.
3.0,"Runs a bit small for a loose fiting style. Very see through, I can see my skin through it and in pasty white."
3.0,"This is a great watch, but the battery died after 4 months even though it says it will be good for 7 years."
3.0,"While it looked very pretty in the box and is functional, the durability of the coating on the metal leaves much to be desired.  The mere act of putting keys on the ring was scratching through the coating and leaving bare patches that were far too visible against the gray.  I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that a key ring be able to have keys put on it without getting marred."
3.0,Shorts are comfortable and are good for lounging or weight lifting they are not well suited for running or any high pace activity especially if you plan on having your phone or other items in your pockets as they move around to an annoying degree.
3.0,I normally wear a size large and these fit my 10 year old daughter perfectly. Way to small and very see through. Great for pajama pants.
3.0,love the style of this bracelet but it came unknotted within *2* weeks. I reknotted it and glued it.
3.0,Ran much smaller than I expected based on reviews and the size chart. Ended up returning.
3.0,"I was so pumped to get these sunglasses in the mail and at first inspection they were fine -- cheaply made and the tint isn't as dark as I would like, but hey you get what you pay for.  However, after wearing them a couple of times I now notice spots and smudges that appear and wont go away.  There is also marks where the tint wasn't applied evenly."
3.0,We got the wrong size. Says for kids size 4-6 but yet received a size 10/12. They're nice otherwise.
3.0,"I like these plugs a lot, however they are definitely bigger than a 00 as I could not even get them in my earlobes. I am very disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing these."
3.0,I dislike because the size was huge for my friend and that’s a nice lil’ change I can’t get back
3.0,"She liked the gift cause it's pretty, but mixing Chakra & Reiki is like mixing Oil & Water!"
3.0,The kitties have great detail. Their tails are intertwined shaping a heart.  And the bottom shows each of their little feet.<br />However they are top heavy and they hang upside down
3.0,should have an additional chain across the back to keep it from slipping off. Cute as long as you aren't moving around!
3.0,It’s cute...but not the best tutu I ever purchased...cheap construction. But wearable.
3.0,The Belt is nice but the sizing is very confusing when ordering and my belt is way to large therefore I can not wear.
3.0,"Not sure why people are saying it's too small - it's too big on me. I'm 32A, 117 lbs, 25"" waist with a big bum and size S was baggy on me. Fits more like a medium. I did like the color though, Brown is a pretty shade of rust. Too bad I have to return it."
3.0,"This would be my favorite suit? I'm 4'11, 128lbs, 34D....the cups on the size M I purchased wouldn't even fit an A cup decently. I was so disappointed.  So now my initial quick delivery is out the door. I have to wait 2-3 weeks to get a replacement in an xl....that's crazy! I hope the suit makes my trip! If you very small chested this could work for you and it's a super cute game changer."
3.0,"These earrings are really cute and as pictured. One stem was bent upon receiving, but I was able to bend it back straight. It is stamped .925 silver, but for whatever reason, these irritated my ears. I took them out and put another pair of earrings in and my ears cleared up. I don’t know if these have some fillers in them or if it is just me. Like I said, it is stamped .925 silver, but I have never had silver irritate my ears before."
3.0,"It was a little more chincy that I was anticipating.  Some of the red was scuffed a bit.  It's still wearable and not worth paying the return shipping, but not the best quality."
3.0,"Looks similar to pic, but may be different top altogether. Not fitted to curves at all, neckline seems higher, and in the pic, there's a dark border around the neckline and straps that I don't see on the one I got. But it's still alright, doesn't seem cheap or tacky. HOWEVER, when I first put it on, it wasn't long before I noticed something scratchy at the back of my neck, and it was really really irritating. I took it off and looked at the tag, and I can't believe they left it this way. The thread they used to sew the tag on is more like wire, it is so scratchy. And it's felt on both sides of the fabric, inside and out. I turned it inside out to wear it that way just while I went to find scissors to fix the tag, because it was scratching so bad, I couldn't stand it even for the little bit of time it was going to take me to go get the scissors. I thought it wouldn't scratch once I had it on inside out, but it did - the thread that's so scratchy was on both sides of the fabric. So I had to go to get scissors topless ha. And it was an easy fix. I was planning to just trim off the offending parts, but I had to entirely remove the whole tag altogether and then still remove some threads left after the tag was off before it was no longer itchy. But that part's fine now. It's a cool little shirt, looks fine, wouldn't have wanted to pay any more for it though. And I should have gotten a medium not a small, even though I more often wear small."
3.0,The product I received was all silver and not black and silver as the picture suggests. Therefore you can't really even see the design.
3.0,I think it runs small. That’s why I gave it 3 stars. I really liked the shirt and the quality but I had to return it because it was too small.
3.0,"Solid, but less than I expected for the price.  Similarly, and lower priced hats come with the silk or cloth scarf.  Also, the inside plastic piece was not attached the way it was shown in the picture.  It was satisfactorily attached by weaving a few reeds through it, and not with string as pictured.  I will remedy this, as it's cheaper than doing a return or ordering a different hat.  The overall construction was good, it's a solid hat, keeps the sun off, haven't tried it in the rain.  Tight weave.  I can't recommend this product over others, but if you want a solid durable hat, this should do it with some easy fixes."
3.0,The dress is beautiful but it runs small. If you have big hips/thighs consider sizing up. I ordered a large and it is too small around that area.
3.0,"The product by itself is great, i like it a lot, but its WAY OVERPRICED!<br />not worth $50<br />if it were $30 i would give it 5 stars"
3.0,"Queda muy grande de la parte baja. Y la tela es diferente a como se ve, h ya tiene pelotitas la tela."
3.0,Just too small. Ordered as per directions and still too small. Leg openings are very tight.
3.0,These run large a nice belt but I had to have them cut down.
3.0,Not happy missing pieces and ear ring broken. This was for a wedding party!!
3.0,"I love it, but it's not big and baggy so buy one size up. I'm 5'5-115lbs and I bought medium. Should have bought large. I still wear it."
3.0,"I am 5'10, 160 lbs and built athletically, I ordered a Medium in the dark gray. It fits well however is shorter than I like for a maxi. Hits me above the ankle. But adorable and comfortable so will be keeping!"
3.0,"I was really excited about receiving this bracelet. It is very unique and looks great on the wrist. It is very adjustable to all sizes. The only problem was that the end cap piece came off within the first week of wearing it. Luckily I found it on my bedroom floor and bought some super strong adhesive and was able to get it back on the bracelet. I'm not sure how long it will hold, but it seems to be staying there for now. I just don't want it to come off again and be lost forever!! Just make sure that it is on there tightly. Other than that it is a very beautiful bracelet! I have had many compliments.<br />Thank you<br />Samantha Belk"
3.0,Not for people with small faces or kids it was really big on me
3.0,finally a pair that isn't see through! they are comfy but the threads are constantly pulling and need to be cut so not made the best.
3.0,"I thought the watch face would be bigger, I'm thinking about sending it back!"
3.0,Had an older version that had smaller ends for the arms of the glasses. These are bigger and not as comfortable. A bit disappointed with this version.
3.0,The shirt came very wrinkled and the material is too thick for workout in my opinion.<br />Shirt is not see through.
3.0,"It's just not a super comfortable shirt, it also is quite short length wise and rides up sometimes."
3.0,"Material is rather cheap and the top color does not match the bottom.  It is not bright pink, it is a dusty mauve."
3.0,"I found the liners to be very long and needed to be cut, but they are very helpful in adding comfort and absorbing perspiration."
3.0,Love the design but fits like a lg not OSFM
3.0,I like the look of the chain a lot and I wear it everyday... but I am actually already on my second one because the first one snapped after 8 months.
3.0,"The pured it s ok but it as a middle pocket in cream color. So I return it. thank you very much, not what I was looking for"
3.0,"I really wanted to like this romper because it's super cute! Unfortunately, it's not a great fit. I tend to fall between a small and medium and made the mistake of getting this in small. The top portion of this fit me just as a small should, however the bottom portion seems to run small. The seat and legs fit me more like an extra small. It just isn't something that I can really wear. If you're between sizes, have a larger bottom half, or want a looser fit, I strongly recommend going up a size.<br /><br />That being said, the construction of this and the fabric is good for this price range ($23.99). The material is a lightweight linen blend that would likely be nice for hot weather and the stitching is done well enough for this price range. It ran through my washer and dryer on cold and low heat without issue- no shrinkage, bleeding, or falling apart."
3.0,It's just ok!
3.0,Built in is too small
3.0,"I thought I'd ordered a wallet with a window for my driver's license, but I didn't. So that's OK.  And it's also OK that I got red when I ordered pink."
3.0,"size small still too big around waist had to order XS, although i like the material not sure how they perform in cold weather or rain."
3.0,I like that it can be worn around neck when not using to cover mouth and nose.  Comfortable. Just wish they made these bigger. Don’t want smushed nose at the end of a long day.  My kids love them.
3.0,"I'm really bummed. These earrings are beautiful, but after the first time I wore them, the gold began flaking off around the edges of the abalone.<br /><br />Update:<br />Changed one star to three. The flaking spots were pretty small, so I went ahead and wore these a few more times. So far, so good. They haven't gotten worse, so I'll keep wearing them for now. They really are very pretty."
3.0,Pretty much what one would expect for the price.
3.0,I like the look of the bracelet. It would be perfect except one of the drawstrings did not have a knot on the end so it pulled through when attempting to put it on and there's no way to get the string back in.
3.0,I like the lenses  color and transperancy however to large for my face
3.0,"Showed up looking great, black started coming off after wearing for 2 weeks."
3.0,"This is a good top for the money but runs small.  Size up one size.  Note, the material is silky, not cottony.  It is more of a dressy top."
3.0,It’s ok at best. I am small but I have curves in all the right places and this dress makes me look 10 pounds heavier. I missed the return window so I’m forced to keep it. I’ll probably use it on days when I’m washing the car or finger painting with my toddler and I don’t care what happens to my clothes. But I hope I don’t run into anyone while I’m wearing it.
3.0,since it is sorta wide.. you tend to slide around in the shoe.
3.0,"Very well made, however, the strap that keeps the boot on the child's foot does not work well. There is such a big gap snow will inevitably get inside or the child's foot will slip out.  Disappointing, as they are light weight and well made."
3.0,Not too bulky....hope they keep my feet warm while in Hokkaido this coming February.
3.0,"I didn't expect a lot for the money I spent, but the belt is just okay. I do like that it came with instructions with different ways to tie it."
3.0,Bought my size I usually wear too small
3.0,"Not amazing, but definitely worth the price. I go through glasses quickly so this worked out. Pouch is nice and helps keep dirt off."
3.0,"The shirt was fine, but felt the price was too expensive for a T-shirt. I ordered it because it was requested as a gift. Normally would not pay this much for a t shirt."
3.0,Was big around the shoulders
3.0,I love the outfit but the only thing is I had to send back and reorder because I got my size the shirt was too small and the shorts fit so I had to send back to go a size up because I needed a bigger shirt . There should be an option where you can choose the size of each now I got a just right shirt and too big shorts but I’m willing to deal with the few wrinkles because the outfit is cute.
3.0,Wish sis was just one solid swimming suit and didn’t have the holes. Comes up high and can see a side boob
3.0,[[VIDEOID:688eeccbc3e34636d406be44480b9311]] Said true to size went on vacation we’re too tight had to remove lace socks to make them little more comfortable finally went barefoot blisters
3.0,"Compré otro anteriormente de la misma marca y talla, pero esté incluso cambio el modelo del bolsillo trasero"
3.0,Pretty much like the picture
3.0,"Really cute band, but it pops open easily. I had a similar band for a year and a half and never had a problem. This one has fallen off about 5 times and I haven't even had it for a month. Besides the clasp, the quality is great and it looks great. People have no idea I'm wearing my fitbit."
3.0,"Too small, uncomfortable due its size."
3.0,The glasses are attractive and block the sun well but the fit is not as expected.  I ordered these for my daughter who wears 68mm glasses.  The temples (arms) are thick (in the left/right dimension) and make the glasses fit more tightly than would be expected.
3.0,"Material is a little things, but still insulates enough on the cooler mornings. Not a beanie I would wear on an extreme cold day, but it manages to block the wind good. Fitment was good, but it does stretch out a bit over time."
3.0,letters are peeling some after a few washes.
3.0,"Size up! Also, really doesn't fit like the picture. It's cute, good quality but didnt love how it looked on me. Sending back"
3.0,It's super cute but the it's HUGE. Padding behind the mask is a little off putting
3.0,It's okay but not soft inside like I wanted. I gave it to my 15 year old to wear.
3.0,"Index finger sewn crooked.  The ""touch"" sensitive part of the index finger doesn't line up correctly.  Had it too hard to use.  Will be returning."
3.0,These ponchos have great rain coverage. They did have a very unpleasant smell
3.0,They're okay as long as you won't be sweating. The adhesive really isn't very good.
3.0,"These shoes are so so so cute!  I went as Jessica Rabbit and wow they looked GREAT!  The event was in gravel, I lasted about 45 minutes, could have lasted an hour otherwise.<br />The buckle is a &#34;snap&#34; sounds cheap, but it's not!  It is adjustable, and is really nice!  Honestly these shoes are really cute!<br />Three stars for the pain, but I'm kinda wimpy!"
3.0,very good shape and color but not that too much quilty
3.0,The post is pretty short! It’s really cute but a little tight.
3.0,La tela es muy transparente
3.0,You get what you pay for. I had this for a month and it was cute but it did break. I might buy another but anyone who thinks this will last longer then a month should not buy.
3.0,"The robe is fine.  When I purchased it, I thought it had a full zipper not halfway.  It is very lightweight."
3.0,"Not very durable, more for show then as real suspenders... will not buy again"
3.0,I love this hat for my daughter.....it fit her just right and the quality of the material was great. I was disappointed that it only came with 1 button not 2 so we were not able to test out the compatibility for mask wearing. We ended up cutting the button off since we didn't have a spare or replacement
3.0,It fits kinda weird
3.0,"These are very nice, but I had trouble getting them in my nose bent. Once I took out some of the angle it was no problem. It stays in through me blowing, wiping and sleeping. I hardly know it's there."
3.0,I can fit this boot  but it runs 1/2 size small and very narrow.
3.0,"The hat I received doesn't look nearly as long and slouchy as the one pictured, and the band that goes around your head is not as wide as the one shown, but it is still very pretty and comfortable!"
3.0,"My usual size is medium, however this is a bit large for a medium. I will return for a size small."
3.0,"The design of the blouse is nice, but I didn't care for the silky-type material and this is the reason I'm only rating it 3 stars."
3.0,"i’m changing my review from 1 star to 3. the color is off by a lot for the pink but it is a nice bag with a lot of pockets. it fits more than you think. the straps are wonky though. are either the smallest or the longest, only two strap options which is weird. my girlfriend loves it and i might order the yellow one for myself."
3.0,"La verdad esta muy frágil, si sirve para cubrir del polvo pero para viajar no sirve. Se tendría que tener mucho cuidado."
3.0,"For all the talk about fit, I ordered both the small and medium in order to cover the possibility of fit problems. I am 5'2&#34; tall 140lbs and have a 29.5-30&#34; waist with both jeans and khaki pants. The small pant fit me almost perfectly aside from being 1.5&#34; long in the legs (story of my life), otherwise I would say they are perfect in size for my height and waist size. Having a 29.5&#34; waist line these pants in a small have about 1 more inch of stretch in the waist line but I would say my 29.5&#34; waist is about max for the Small. So if your  waist is larger than a 30&#34; I would order a medium for sure. If your taller than 5'4&#34; I would order a medium as well. The pants are light and look to be of decent quality (only time will tell). The zippers are the one thing that worry me but I have said that before about a product and been pleasantly surprised. Once again only time will tell. Overall I am pleasantly surprise. If these pants hold up through the spring and summer hiking season here in the northwest I would give them 5 starts for best bang for buck as I only paid $19 with prime for them. As an everyday kick around pant I would say they would be a 5 star for the price. I myself will actually use them for hiking, camping and outdoor activities so quality will be tested."
3.0,"The quality was not as good as I expected, but the fit is great."
3.0,Bummed these are shiny material will be returning.
3.0,It's to big for my small head but I made due. It fits the glasses. The hat is not heavy enough to stay on your head while riding.
3.0,Made me look like a big rectangle and the zipper was a major pain
3.0,The thing I wish this watch would have came with is a piece of plastic you would have to remove for the watch to start running. The battery was already going. Don't know how long it was running but hope it doesn't stop soon on me for the battery or else it was a wasted purchase and I would have to return.
3.0,Very cute color and love the lace and bows on zipper but too small.
3.0,"I loved the bands themselves,  but was disappointed that the pins were too big for my watch even when it said they would fit."
3.0,Iron...You must be willing to get the iron out for this one.  It looks terrible otherwise.
3.0,These turtlenecks are nice but they run a little small to size for a muscular young man at 6’2”
3.0,"The fabric smells like fuel, even after washing. Lessening after 4 to 5 washes"
3.0,Not the intensity of red color I was expecting.
3.0,Fabric not so good but fit well<br />5&#34;9 and was mid calf
3.0,Nice cut but size up. I wanted  something to help cover my midsection/stomach. This was not a good fit returned.
3.0,"So while this is a decent dress, I ordered the red short sleeved style. But it not red. It’s a brownish maroonish color. I’m attaching a picture<br />Also, the back feels stretched out and doesn’t lie flat against my back. It looks puffed out. For this reason, I can’t say that it fits as expected. I think I should have gotten a size small so that it would fit as shown in listing."
3.0,The bag isn’t what I pictured I received a bag sewn with white tread and my bag wasn’t BLACK & BLUE it was more like just GREY The bag itself seems to be strong but the fastener fell off right away and it didn’t work well to begin with I also order a army green and it’s still in the plastic because it too is sewn together with that ugly WHITE top tread!!
3.0,Buckle is nice.  The strap is not nice - more like vinyl or plastic than leather.
3.0,Not as sparkly as I thought they would be. Nice for everyday wear but the ones they are replacing (I lost one) are cut better to allow more light to reflect.<br />Good quality though...
3.0,This is a great concept for fishermen who need close-up site to aid in there fishing.<br />However these were a gift and just wasn't like preferred style.
3.0,when stretches the design fade and almost see thu
3.0,"Both sets of mask buttons need to be repositioned. Forward button location prevents correct mask fitting, especially with glasses. Rear button needs to be repositioned reward, and higher."
3.0,not the same product showed in the picture
3.0,The color is not the same
3.0,This outfit is more of a sweat suit type outfit. The material is made of cheap nylon. Therefore you won't get many wears out of this if it's washed wrong. To be more precise it will nap up and shrink if put into the dryer. I had fun wearing this and got plenty of comments as well as compliments. I'm 5'4 and 140#'s I purchased a large and it fit me snug.Also it's advertised as a hoody tracksuit there is no hoody! 🤔
3.0,I purchased these for my 18 month old daughter because she had another pair of shorts from Zutano and we loved them! Unfortunately we didn’t love these as much. They were just too loose and baggy so they didn’t get much wear.<br /><br />Update: I kept them in the drawer and my now 3 year old daughter can still fit these. She wears 3-4T bottoms and 4T tops for reference. Guess it’s a win for longevity! Just wish I had picked a more versatile print so they could have maybe had more use.
3.0,"very cheap made ,would do for costume but they are not what I expected"
3.0,It's ok just a bit small
3.0,The dress didn't fit me well. Didn't care for the low neckline for someone my age.
3.0,Scratchy material. It is 100% polyester and feels that way. Cute but not sure how great it will be since it’s not a comfortable feeling.
3.0,Nice however but order two sizes greater than you wear.
3.0,The earrings are pretty but the backs are too big and come off.  I have to use those little silicone dots with the backs to keep them on.  Unfortunately the earrings are not comfortable to wear because of the ill-fitting  backs.
3.0,"Solid well made chain and beads (listed as Pearls in the literature).  The cross, corpus, and medallion are made from cast white metal.  The castings are done well and the highly filigreed cross with written prayers and images are sharp and clear.  The Our Father beads are the same size as the Hail Mary beads and are insufficiently separated from the decade beads.<br /> Not the best configuration for serious prayer."
3.0,Soft and stretchy material but disappointed that the white shirt came with a small stain and closed up it looks like old blood. Not okay with that. I hope it comes off with wash.
3.0,Could be less itchy.
3.0,"Comfortable and warm gloves, but right-hand glove does not work with the touch screen. Strange that left one does and not right."
3.0,I really like these socks but I was disappointed when one of them had a hole in the toe after 3 or 4 washings. Haven't had a problem since then and would would buy again.
3.0,"I like that this watch has a self-stand.  It is a very elegant looking watch.  It is very pretty.<br /><br />The one downside is that the hands are very difficult to see.  I took away two stars for that.  If you cannot read the time from more than six inches away, then you defeat the whole purpose of the watch, especially a self-standing one.<br /><br />There are two reasons the hands are difficult to see.  First, this is a skeleton watch.  If the face of the watch was solid white, you could make out the hands.  But since the center of the face is missing, the hands blend into the inner workings of the watch.  The second reason the hands are hard to see is they are very thin and too short.  The minute hand doesn't even extend into the outer part of the face that is white so there can be some contrast between the black minute hand and the white face.  The hour hand is practically invisible.<br /><br />I understand the desire to make this watch look stylish, and it does.  But one does not necessarily have to sacrifice practicality to make something attractive at the same time.  It's gorgeous, but annoying at the same time.  I have a lot of pocket watches. Just a doubling in thickness of the hands would have made this a favorite."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Nothing wrong with it, just cheap"
3.0,The pattern is beautiful however the color is not brown it’s yellow brown!
3.0,"This necklace is adorable, but the arrow is so incredibly tiny that it's almost not visible unless you put your eyeballs inches from my neck. And if you do that, I'm going to be unhappy with your invasion of my space, so I don't recommend it. Well crafted piece of jewelry, though. Just extremely subtle."
3.0,"The hat is thick enough to keep you warm. The zipper to access the Bluetooth headset likes to catch on the cloth when you open or close it. The headset itself is a very very cheap Chinese product. The glue holding the Velcro strips is weak so strait out of the package I reglued everything with a hot glue gun. The sound quality is ok considering these aren't in ear ear buds. The Mic to pic up voice conversation is very sensitive which isn't necessarily a bad thing just that keep in mind if you have any noise around you while talking the Mic will pick it up. For the price it's alright, the headset quality is meh. Hey At least the hat is warm!  I plan on taking the cheap headset out and replacing it with someone with better quality."
3.0,"Cute dress, but too low in the top, and short in skirt, for tall girl. Will need to add an under-layer to wear comfortably."
3.0,"This suit is definitely a &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; situation.  I bought it knowing full well it was  cheap knock off.  That being said, the suit is fine, not great, but fine for an under $20 suit.  As previous reviews have stated it does run small.  I bought a medium for my 5&#34;7 160 lbs self and the top was laughable once I got it on."
3.0,Didn't realize compression ran so small. Need to return for larger size.
3.0,Ordered a 4x and it fit like a 2× or 3×.
3.0,"They light up buuuut the button isn't set right in the shoe. It looks line someone cut a hole into the inside of were the button is suppose to stay but the entire wire is exposed making it difficult to tuck away and set it back in place. One shoe changes more than 2 colors while the other one is red, green, yellow, or flash mode."
3.0,WAY WAY WAY too small even though I ordered an XXL. I gave it to my daughter who wears a size 6 and she wore it to a barn wedding. Cute well made but you need to get some accurate size conversions for the USA marketplace.
3.0,"I wold like to give 2-1/2 stars ✨. I like the fabric and the shape of the gloves, but ...they are falling apart. The quality is not what I was looking for. I paid 21 dls total with the gloves and the shipment and I think is not worth it. they are holes everywhere and I don't even have 2 months with them. I think they are too expensive for a product that is not going to last with a good quality for more than a month. I am a hiker by the way."
3.0,Nice print and works well with tights.  However the dress sizing is a bit odd. The top half is really loose and the bottom is tight around the hips.  so not ideal for pear-shaped women who're heavier around the hips
3.0,"Unfortunately the shirt was just a bit too small. Cool shirt, decent screen print. Obviously it's not any kind of official Wolves merchandise but seller never mentioned it was."
3.0,REAL cheap and small.
3.0,"One of the clips fell apart before I ever got to use them. After putting things back together, things work pretty well. I am 6'4&#34; and it would be helpful if these were a bit longer."
3.0,"Great dress, runs a little small. Nice material and style; good quality! Great for a summer or spring wedding!"
3.0,I do love this product the only problem is even though I know you can’t use this is water. I used it in a Humid place and when I got home it WAS NOT THE SAME COLOR. So it was not in the water but obviously it did change the color to a greenish yellowish. Was disappointed but it’s nice.
3.0,"There’s faux leather, and then there’s a black trash bag. Know that what you receive won’t look like the picture. It looks like a large black trash bag that’s been cut into the shape of a skirt."
3.0,"I am older and have recently lost about 80lbs. Thus my skin is not tight any more. These compression socks dig in at the top where the top if finished. (It looks like the fabric has been turned over). Please note, they seam to be better than other compression socks I have tried, The are probably great for people with thin legs or that have not lost a bunch of weight."
3.0,It’s cheap. It fades after one wash. It’s just ok!
3.0,It was a little to short for my 5’8 175lb frame. I like things that hit right at the knee but this came almost mid thigh. It will probably only be used to go out with my husband and not for work.
3.0,Didn't fit me as description stated.
3.0,"Runs small, so size up!  Material is thin, so if you’re “busty” an stretch it a bit, it can get sheer on the top part. The sash is a tad short too. It’s still is a cute dress though."
3.0,"I chose this shirt because I wanted an attractive UV safe outdoors shirt for gardening, hiking, and equestrian sports. I have 2 shirts by Columbia that have served well, and these shirts had a similar description but looked more feminine online — the reason I chose them. I ended up returning them because they fit long and the fabric was very thin and clung to my skin. I am 5’8-1/2” tall, and I purchased a large.  The length fit like a beach coverup —- I would have preferred something 4-6 inches shorter (even if I wanted to wear it tucked in). There are front pouch pockets so belting or tucking isn’t a great option. The fabric is thin and has a silky appearance, but it doesn’t feel silky in my skin — it feels clingy.  The shirts are as described online, but not what I personally imagined."
3.0,Gift to someone
3.0,"These are cute, not too comfortable."
3.0,"Feels not good to skin, you will be sweating under such fabric. Looks cheap"
3.0,I couldn't get it in my ears :/ Looked a bit bigger than my other 2g jewelry
3.0,I ordered a size medium which typically fits me in a glove but was a little large in this glove. The biggest issue is the smell which hits you when you first remove the gloves from the clear plastic in which they arrive. I have put them in the dryer with fragrance beads but still cannot get rid of the stench. I have had this same problem with other garments made in China.
3.0,Daughter wore it.  It’s flimsy
3.0,Not a well made as most of my other turquoise purchased in the past.felt that the ring was not as sturdy as the bracelet
3.0,"Look ok,collors makes me abset ."
3.0,Its okay..just wish it had a better material
3.0,There are two holes in each pocket probably due to poor quality sewing.
3.0,Comfortable shoes. Not for people with high arches.
3.0,"This ring is nice enough, however, it's not as robust as it appears online. It's quite thin, but it's sturdy."
3.0,This dress is cute. The reviews said it runs big so I ordered a small and it doesn't fit.
3.0,Very nice but to big😒
3.0,I love this dress. Definitely was smaller then expected. I got a Large and I normally wear a Medium and still very tight
3.0,The fit was good -- I wear a size 12 and the large fit comfortably.  But the elastic around the legs cinched around the butt and the seam would definitely show in yoga pants or leggings.  I also didn't like the feel of the polyester fabric.  Its soft but artificial.
3.0,It's a great concept but the constant wiping condensation off the inside plastic get annoying
3.0,I love the dress. I did think it would fit different. My only other complaint is the tie doesn’t stay tied which is a bit annoying
3.0,"No es cuero genuino , lamentable por eso."
3.0,"I am a 34F and ordered 3 other bras from other vendors with this particular order.  Two fit true, but on this one I had major side boobage sticking out under my arms.  The band seemed a bit tight, too.  The fabric is nice...it seems to be a well made bra, but I would recommend going a size up in the band, two in the cup."
3.0,Not as bright as in the ad pictures. ..
3.0,Strings on seams started to fray immediately. Every time I wear I find a new runaway thread that needs clipping. It a matter of time before the seams give due to no more thread to hold them closed.
3.0,It's ok. It looks very cute in the picture but it seems to run a little smaller than I expected.
3.0,The scarf is pretty but as soon as I opened it it had strings hanging off like it had gotten caught on something... doesn’t make any sense for it come in already coming unraveled...
3.0,"the design is matching my watch model, however it looks softer, and it doesn't come with pins."
3.0,"Item is made well, would love to give it 5 stars, it doesn't have enough length to fit over an adult head. I had purchased it to give 2 away. Doesn't fit, giving an inch more would make a difference. Or you have to remove from one arm which would compromise it. Beautiful product though, and as described. Because of size would not purchase again. Sorry..."
3.0,Shirt fits loose but shows too much of my abdomen for me ( my fault though)
3.0,"Cute dress, fits a little smaller than I was hoping. The white on the dress is very see-through, too. The material is nice and light but at the sake of being practically transparent. Just make sure you wear light undies or a slip."
3.0,"The title for this product leads you to believe there is ""2"" since it says ""2 pack"". It seems that later the seller placed a note stating it is only 1 not 2 but I already purchased. The scarf is lovely but there is only 1, I thought I was getting 2 like I ordered. Aside from that, the scarf is very nice."
3.0,Dress is too long and too big on top. Will return.
3.0,It’s soft and pretty but not the same color green
3.0,I like the cut of these. Doesn’t offer enough lower tummy control for me so I had to return them. Love the shorts version from this brand though
3.0,"Thinner material then exspected! Runs Large! Fortunately 4 leopard,it will work"
3.0,Well made but not great fit. Loose and lumpy
3.0,This is adorable. Very quick shipping. The only problem was that the hat is very large for a newborn. It swallowed him.
3.0,"i bought these for my boyfriend who has his ears gauged at 2g for months now. Initially I was very impressed with variety that you get for the price, but I do not think they are true to size. He has been wearing two different pairs for about a week switching every couple days and they continue to fall out of his ear."
3.0,A little loose.
3.0,It arrived damaged and too late to replace. Don't like paying full price for something I need to sew to make right. 😩
3.0,"The ears are a bit wonky in shape, but it is otherwise exactly as expected."
3.0,Way too tight for me. Typically I don’t have a problem with shoes but these just didn’t fit anywhere. My feet and calf’s were squished. Order a size up. They look nice.
3.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, 145lbs, 34C-28-39. I ordered a large as suggested and it fits length-wise (I used the suggested size guide b/c normally I'd order a medium). The bust is a little narrow, so doing laps or fully extending my arms upwards will expose my boob (on the strapless side). FYI the back is solid orange."
3.0,Giving this 3 stars because I wear (2nd to smallest) as a cartlidge earring and the length is just a little long.
3.0,Did not create any cleavage as advertised
3.0,"Be prepared to use tape! This shirt is very cute, but if you move everything will show!"
3.0,The necklace was beautiful on my child. And she loved it so much. The chain was very thin though. She jas already broken the chain. She was alble to catch the charm. I have to buy her a new chain now.
3.0,Quality was a little light
3.0,Fits on the small side.  Material is rough and not soft or stretchy.  Only washed once so will see how it holds up.  Will not be one of my favorite shirts.
3.0,Material wasn't what I thought.
3.0,"I was hoping for more out of this scarf than I got. It's called &#34;Silk Effects&#34; because it is 100% polyester and made in China, and while there's nothing wrong with that it's something people might be confused on so just mentioning it. The print is lovely, but it's printed on only one side, so when you wear it you have to have it just right or you get the bottom showing through. Combine that with the scarf's small-ish size (and my largish neck) and it's not a scarf I can get a lot of use out of."
3.0,"The pants were really uncomfortable,  baggy in the crotch. The hat is velcro and was a bit confusing to put together."
3.0,Like the hat it is a antique type finish almost gray thought I ordered black
3.0,Liked the fabric also not too thin.  I realized I would have to wear it braless and I am not built for that.  It was way too small.
3.0,Perfect for everyone
3.0,Really cute but way longer than just below the knee and I'm 5'7
3.0,Smaller than  standard xL
3.0,Fit big. Not like the model. Not super flattering. Lots of extra material in the bottom half.
3.0,One of the shell pieces broke when I wore it once. :(
3.0,It's very small :( Has potential to be SO cute and grungy/edgy if it would fit properly.<br />Instead it looks like a pilgrim's hat on me :(
3.0,"I usually wear a size small but, got a medium. The fabric is very thin and will shrink in the dryer. I am 5'6"" and the tunic length was nice but, the sleeves are short on me. (I do not have long arms, lol)  Probably will return because the quality is not  worth the price paid."
3.0,Super small! Size at least 2 sizes up. I normally wear a small/medium and I ordered a medium I should have ordered an extra large. Pay attention the measurements. Easy to return.
3.0,I feel like the material is a good quality but I ordered a size 10 for a boy size 8 to grow into and the shorts are like daisy dukes on him..he likes them so we’re keeping them until they are ready for goodwill in about 2 months once he’s grown a bit more. Wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e66b4f380e1a0983f695492f08b2582a]] Even at it's tightest, it slides around a lot. Probably will return."
3.0,I didn’t like because it is loosen and broken
3.0,On the small size
3.0,"I ordered a size XL according to the bust measurement in the description. It fit a bit smaller than other shirts I have with the same measurements.<br />It also is fitted a bit more than the picture appears.  It has a slight taper from the bust to the hips, not nearly as loose as the picture.The material was not as soft as I expected since it was a cotton/poly blend.  It feels more like a lightweight sweater.  I will definitely need shapewear under it."
3.0,I like this item. But It was not that much good wht i thought. It seems diffrent in picture. All these reason am giving 3 stars
3.0,Not quite what I expected. I thought the fish was in liquid and it moved. Not so.
3.0,"I love being able to wear this everywhere, but my phone has fallen out several times. The glass shield cracked, so I had to replace it. Charging is difficult when it is out of the case. I love having my drivers license and a couple credit cards easy to access and use"
3.0,"Adorable, but very large in chest area.  My breasts are quite large from nursing right now, but I still had to clip the front together with a mini binder clip."
3.0,Its a beautiful dress except the belt is to high up under the chest
3.0,Very cute but had a hole in it an hour after being worn. Not sure if it was always there or it's just a low quality swimsuit.
3.0,"I really would rather give it 3.5 stars, instead of 3 or 4.<br /><br />It's a tad on the small size, so it's a little tight putting the hood up. Can't use with any eyewear while having the face part cover your nose. The condensation from your breathe will fog eyewear. Also the face part is a bit tricky to get to stay in place. The draw strings help with that a little. But if you fool around with it for a minute it's ok.<br /><br />Overall, 3 stars. Not totally what I expected but cool and useful nonetheless."
3.0,All the nerds were jealous on Halloween
3.0,"A great price for a bulk supply, so of course the quality is middling. The cords themselves are fine, though of course nothing fancy. Several of the clasps are prone to getting stuck and feel like they will break before long. But, at this price what can one expect. Good enough for my purposes."
3.0,"The chest area was small.  It didn't fit right.  My boobs were sagging . So you know when the suits get wet, it will get worse.  So i got a  bigger size. Danggggg it... but prettier color and I can't wait! !"
3.0,It’s too thin and wayyyy too big. Looks like I’m wearing 3 sizes too large for an oversized chic look. Wouldn’t buy again
3.0,"not amazing, i guess for the price its fine"
3.0,I have worn three of the four pairs received and one was so small I could hardly get them on. Those came off and went directly into the trash. That was disappointing. The other pairs have been fine...and fun!!
3.0,I do love this ring and still wear it but the one part of the “wing” fell out in less than a month. I did buy this end of July but I will admit I’m a little late in writing this review.
3.0,"Since they are so thin and its cold, I haven't worn them yet but when spring arrives and I want lighter socks I think they will be very comfortable!"
3.0,A little too shiny and heavy for me. Cute style though.
3.0,"Larger than I thought it would be, the shoulder strap is too long; had to pin in to shorten it. Otherwise, I like all the pockets, and the color."
3.0,These were big for my wrist. They fit the tracker I have. I would buy again but try to get a small size.
3.0,"They are comfortable, but the material is more like athletic wear than softer cottony feel yoga wear. However, even with all its athletic feel it's not at all compressive and very thin. They are nice to wear around the house or out with a long shirt, but they are not flattering and show every line and bump."
3.0,"used less than 15 mins and the seam on the left glove started to come a part,<br /><br />they did fit my larger hands, that was the only plus of them,  may have been  a fluke but I was still getting sparks in the glove through the seam on the index finger,<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Added  a month+ later:<br />I had some &#34;shoe goo&#34;, and fixed the seam with that, and sealed the seams with the &#34;shoe goo&#34; , after sealing up the seams with &#34;shoe goo&#34; I had no more problems with the gloves,  and no more sparks through the seam,<br /><br />my son works as a welder in a fabrication shop, and said they were having problems with there welding gloves (do not know the brand), some times not lasting a day,  and they started sealing the seams with some kind of glue product and extending the life of there gloves life by many  times with the seams sealed,<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />WITH SEALED SEAMS I would give these gloves a 4 star, (but you have to seal the seams your self),<br /><br />changed the star rating to a three  as I originally had a one, but I do like the gloves, and the fit, and comfort, and with the seam sealed up there a good glove,  and have not shrunk much with heat,"
3.0,"Kafton is pretty, design is as depicted and size is great. Extremely disappointed that the sleeve as depicted is no way close to what you get. The sleeve doesn't flow off the shoulders like the picture but sits like all kaftons. It serves the purpose for which it was purchased, a swimsuit cover up and for the price it will work."
3.0,Nice vest but the medium is waaaaaay too baggy on me. I am usually a medium in most clothes so I was surprised by this fit. It fit me more like an extra large. I plan on returning it.
3.0,"I’m 5’9” and 200lbs.  It’s mostly the height where I think it could be more forgiving.  It’s a bit of an effort getting in and out of it.  Nevertheless, it is comfortable to wear and cute."
3.0,"Its really cute but its a little uncomfortable. the bow on the left is not as big as it is in the picture. Its soooo small and quite sharp. If you wear on your bare chest it irritates the skin and is not good for an all day outfit but f you wear it on a turtleneck or a sweater, it damages the fabric. Be careful with what you wear with it."
3.0,I have a small bust and found it quite tight--order size up
3.0,The sandals are well made of good quality materials.  My disappointment was finding that the side strap was merely decorative.  It does not tighten or loosen the fit. It does nothing but act as a velcroed decoration.  Only the rear strap is adjustable.
3.0,Wayyy too large for kids
3.0,My girlfriend doesnt like them :(
3.0,"Cute but listened to other reviews that said to buy one size up.  Buy your regular size, this is loose and hangs off me, but I put a belt on it and it looks good that way, though I wanted to wear it loose.  Also very sheer and see thru."
3.0,"It's an adorable sweater but is too small.  The 10/12 ran too small for my 10 yr. Old son, it didn't ever fit my 7 yr<br /> Old nephew."
3.0,"It took forever to ship, and frankly not worth what I paid. I mean it's not trash, just not worth the shipping cost for how long it took."
3.0,The material was a little itchy and the wrap style didn’t really lay right .
3.0,el material no me gusto se esta desconchando :( desde el primer dia de uso
3.0,I expected the size to be comfortable but it is very large
3.0,"My wife tried these jogger sweat pants, and wasn't overly impressed. She found the exterior material to be thick and stiff, and not that comfortable. They have zippered pockets, but the style of the pocket looks off. They fit fairly snug but basically true to size. The color is a nice light gray that matches with everything."
3.0,"LOVE the style of this jacket. It runs small, so order a size up."
3.0,Beautiful boots look really solid but unfortunately they ran really small so I had no choice but to return them the very next day. I would of given them 5 stars had it not been for the size issue!
3.0,I bought it for my Daugther and she love it... I didn't see it in store... very nice piece....and the price
3.0,"Rough material, to be expected at this price."
3.0,These are really thin but they work under my dresses.
3.0,Cute hat but bill is to long
3.0,"pretty color, but it really didn't accentuate my figure."
3.0,It was a well fit for my husband. The only thing that was not liked was the back pocket as it was totally off color. It gave a weird look though.<br />Material is good and comfortable
3.0,"I'm sad. I wanted to love this bracelet for me and my friend! But the second I put it on, the metal tips fell off. I guess I will see if they will hold with glue. Otherwise they are cute little bracelets!"
3.0,"Somewhat small, and the interior snap pocket rubs the top of head, it was returned. Loved the look though, really cool!"
3.0,"I like the gradient and color of these. But the lenses on the glasses are Huge... like 3&#34; across for each. And the wire that connects both the lenses (in between them) is really wide also. Because of this they look more like glasses for a costume,  rather than regular use. I'll still wear them occasionally, but only when I'm feeling over the top for the day"
3.0,I totally love the ring. Will order from this company again.
3.0,"Legs to short for someone 6' & 3"" Tall...!"
3.0,I got these for the game and watch handhelds. Fit perfectly!  The smell of them is unbearable.  Hopefully they will get better with time.
3.0,super cute just too heavy for me to use on a daily.
3.0,I do like the compression socks and the pains and swelling in my ankles are gone.  I purchased a 6 pack of Large/XL and one pair was actually small/med packaged as large/xl.  I could have given more stars if I had actually gotten the 6 pair that I paid for.
3.0,"Skyway’s UV400 Polarized sunglasses offer excellent protection, polarized lenses and good styling at a very affordable price. At the time of this review they’re priced at 15 bucks and for this price you’re getting quality eye protection and a soft carrying case too. There’s also a card that helps prove these lenses are polarized but there’s nothing else special about it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- UV400 protection offers some of the best available protection currently on the market to protect vision from harmful UV rays.<br />- Gray and black styling is a welcome change at this price point as most other offerings are all black with little to no variation between them.<br />- Carrying case. My glasses tend to get lost or broken without a proper carrying case. The carrying case that accompanies these glasses is an unexpected but welcome addition.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The thing that kills these shades for me is the awful glare and reflections that show up around the edges of these shades. Having been in the orchestral band and martial arts for most of my jr and high school years I learned to rely on my peripheral vision. Most users may not notice the glare and reflections I find distracting, but I simply cannot unsee them whenever I wear these shades now.<br />- While the case is a nice touch it’s a soft case with a strap and loop fastener as a securing mechanism. It’s a bit more time consuming than other cases I’ve used which simply use hinges to securely shut the case. I also wish the case were hard instead of soft as the former added more protection.<br /><br />Overall, I think these shades from Skyway offer to styling and protection most people desire out of budget sunglasses. For users like me who rely on their peripheral vision these sunglasses aren’t a good fit. The glare and reflections I see on the outer rims of the lenses are too distracting for me to use these sunglasses daily. However, others may not be so sensitive to this additional visual stimuli and may find these shades to be perfect for them. To those I say give Skyway’s product a try. It’s a very good value at $15.00. For those like me who tend to not be so tunnel visioned I’d recommend considering other eyewear options."
3.0,Hat does not fit good.
3.0,Great material but did not fit how expected
3.0,The stitching around the arm holes is not very strong.
3.0,"thought it would be softer, its polyester . cant machine wash so annoying . i have a latina butt so the dress is shorter in the back . ugh . its comfortable and just ok for the price"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:6b86f429be521b3f56cfa0c54c047e59]] Classy and sexy, but not for quiet places! Swishes when you move!"
3.0,They were nice glasses just too big for my face. I returned them over a month ago and still no refund. Little upsetting!
3.0,"The fit is great but the darker ones have been  washed a few times and are fading kinda bad. The blue, red mainly."
3.0,"Not sure if they are KF94 certified, and the masks just feel too small and too tight. I thought it was one size fits all; apparently not. Will check next time if they have large sizes."
3.0,"This looks sexy on but the quality is not great. The section that hangs at the front isn't properly sewn so looks cheap. I sewed it up myself and it looks better now, but was a pain to do that."
3.0,"I bought these thinking they were Oofos, which they are not. If you're standing still, these things are fantastic. Lots of support, very firm, feel great.<br /><br />However, because they're so firm, I found walking in them to be painful. Actually, the bottom of feet are all cut up and I'm pretty sure it's from these sandals. Maybe I needed to give them more time to break them in (and for my feet to adjust to them?) but this wasn't fun. I switched to Oofos and am loving them."
3.0,I Loved these boots but I was so disappointed when I couldn't even get my foot down in them! I was heartbroken!
3.0,"Listen to what the other reviews say about this item running small and order a size up. I am usually a size xs or small and i ordered a size medium in this and it fit perfect. Material is too sheer to even wear in public. I will need to get another layer added inside to be able to wear out anywhere. So as of now it is just sitting in my room waiting to go to get altered. Also the fabric in the picture looks like cotton, but it is polyester. so that was bit confusing when it arrived too. Overall ok, cute style."
3.0,Looks good but low quality material
3.0,The quality is regular and size is too small
3.0,Shorts are cute.  fabric is really soft too.  Used them on a 2.5hr trainer ride.  Very little padding which I was a bit concerned about.  It turned out to not be an issue at all.  My only concern is the shorts creep up and I had to keep pulling them down.  Perhaps they are a little over sized.  I could probably use them for a short triathlon but definitely not suited for long course.  They didn't feel as compressed as my other tri shorts.  When I jumped off the bike for my transition run I felt the the junk in the trunk moving all over the place.  So again perhaps a bit over sized.  In other brands I wear a large so for this brand I should have ordered a medium...still not sure that would have resolved the shorts creeping up and hold things in place.
3.0,Wish it had a plastic protector inside for when you make out a check. I like it otherwise.
3.0,The material is not what was expected... it is very shiny and cheap. I was expecting a cotton feel and got polyester instead. The only reason I'm keeping this is because it is the colors of my favorite sports team and will survive 1 season to show my team spirit.
3.0,"These are so cute and fuzzy warm! One strong yank and BAM, mitten off string."
3.0,I love the mask and how its made. I DONT like that the pitbull print because its printed backward.  Other than that it's a well made mask.
3.0,"I thought the top was a little smaller than I would have liked.....I usually wear an XL, but I got an XXL for more room.  Lucky I did, because it just fit.  So beware and get a bigger size than you wear."
3.0,"The earring is cute, size is just the right one for daily wear. The only problem is the hoop lock in the back is flimsy and need to position it in order to lock it other than that it’s good for daily use."
3.0,"Loved the color and style of this bathing suit. I'm not skinny, not anywhere near fat, just a normal healthy woman. The middle strap is unforgiving."
3.0,"Very nice, but seemed small for my teenager. It fit the younger girls perfect."
3.0,"Great design, too small and thin see thru"
3.0,I'm kind skeptical about my hats. This one is on me for not knowing all the different styles of hats out there. i know i was looking for a mid crown but did not know about structuerd and semi soft and soft front I guess.  this was a little to soft in the front for me. But nothing a little hat card board wouldn't fix. This is a nice hat though. Thanks
3.0,The quality of this product is very good that's not the cheap fishnet material from nylon. However the sizing is very poor it was very small with no give. Sorry I have to send it back
3.0,So cute.  I get lots of compliments.  After a few hours of wearing my ears are starting to become infected.  They are very cheap quality.  But for the price I didn't expect anything else so no one is to blame.  they are just painful to wear so I don't any longer.
3.0,I received the wrong color but the quality of the bracelet is good. It comes in a little slide out box which is perfect for gifting.
3.0,I'll give it a 3 star. It was nice just wast the right kind for my watch thought it was. Need better pic of it
3.0,"The black bottom of the shoe started to wear and tear the first time my 8 year old son played in them.  He's worn them for a week, and the black on the bottom is wearing pretty quickly."
3.0,I bought this item since I think it's cool and fun when I talk to my friends online and take some pics sometimes. however the strap is kinda loose and hard to keep it stay on my head...I think with rubber band and some magic sticker it will be better...maybe?
3.0,Comfortable!  They did not hold up very well. My daughter only got to wear them for for softball games and then they broke. She was extremely careful with them before after and during her games as she never took them off her face unless she was giving them to me to put in case. When not in use they were always in their case.
3.0,Finish is rubbing off.  Otherwise I do like the ring.
3.0,"Color Just as the pic. Runs very very large, so looses the fit and form, which is it's best asset."
3.0,cute but the color is not the same as pictured. In the picture the flower and color are more dark color looking but when I received the swimsuit the color was more bright then dark color. Wish it was the same color as pictured. Will be returning it.
3.0,"Your arms better be slender!  This is a very pretty blouse.  I didn't think my arms were large, but this blouse told me otherwise.  They are VERY small arm holes.  If you are slim and have a small bust (ruffles at the bust enhance) this will be a really georgous blouse for you!  I had to return mine."
3.0,Not bad...it tears off very easily!
3.0,"I purchased for an event. I ordered a Large which is what I normally wear. When I tried it on, the slit hit above mid-thigh and was super long even with heels. This dress would work better for someone that has long legs and is taller than 5’5”! Otherwise, was super cute!"
3.0,"Im on the fence about these.. They are very cute and feel great! I wish the waist band was a little longer, it runs a little small in size but long in length. I had to roll the bottom up. I will definitely wear them but I'm still on the hunt for the perfect & cheap leggings."
3.0,"It's a great idea, but the compass leaks.  Once it has enough air bubbles inside it, it no longer works properly.  Get a quality liquid free model instead.  Also, the paracord for the bracelet will break free, and I had to superglue my bracelet back together."
3.0,"It’s an okay idea.<br /><br />The issues:<br />Sound hardware moves around<br /><br />Buttons are very cheap sounding, like they click and you are fearful they will break<br /><br />The battery life isn’t horrible, it just represents the cost."
3.0,Very cute shoes - Just not real durable for everyday use.  My daughter loved these shoes however the bow fell off which we fixed then a few weeks later the elastic broke on one shoe.  The company was very good to work with and fix the problem.
3.0,Good thing they are for lounging at home - I must have missed the part that they were not regular but tall.<br />They will be a comfort shirt to wear.
3.0,Super soft but kind of a nightmare because it sheds. I don't even want to know what it will be like to wash because it sheds so much
3.0,They are very tight
3.0,It's okay<br />Some of them loosen up after dew days
3.0,"PLS BE ADVISED THAT THIS BAG IS VERY VERY SMALL. MY DAUGHTER HAS TO CRAMP HER BALLET SHOES TIGHT LEOTARD IN THIS BAG, LOOKS WAY BIGGER IN PIC THEN IT REALLY IS."
3.0,"This should be called &#34;Henley-style&#34;. It's a v-neck t-shirt with three buttons sewn on, not an actual Henley collar that could be buttoned/unbuttoned. Slim fit, thin material. Fine for what it is, just not what I wanted."
3.0,Meets expectations as a lightweight sleeveless summer dress.  Runs smaller as I normally wear xl but ordered xxl and glad I did as it’s still a bit tighter than I’d like.
3.0,"Larger than expected, returned."
3.0,Love the color combination! I didn't like the way I looked in the dress!
3.0,sizing too large.
3.0,"Very cool looking and great price. Not built to last but we kinda expected that from the reviews. Good for an occasional wear, my daughter wears them to night events at church/youth group and all the kids comment on them. She likes that. A few lights went out, and a few are always the wrong color, but they're still cool. Would be really nice if they spent a few more bucks on quality."
3.0,Esta bastante bien
3.0,"This is a very soft, beautiful purse, but it's a little too big for me, especially since, because it's so soft, it collapses, flops over, when I set it down, along with the straps.  That makes it kind of hard for me to pick up.  Plus, When it's on the floor, the straps would become somewhat of a tripping hazard.  For some this might be the ideal purse....soft, well made, beautiful color and a great price for the product, but I am returning."
3.0,Color is more aqua and no where near blue but  it very beautiful..
3.0,"It looks inexpensive, so I didn't want to keep it.<br />It was inexpensive, so, I should not have made this purchase."
3.0,"I have had 2 surgeries on my leg and my ankle frequently swells, so I am very familiar with compression socks. I am a 6'2"" woman with long legs, size 12 feet and 16"" calves so I ordered size large (following the size chart). They are great in length, pretty easy to get on BUT too tight at the top below the knee and not enough compression around the ankle. I could only give them 3 stars because I found other brands better for me."
3.0,I didn’t realize that it was gonna have these extra long straps that require tying. So if ur like creative u will have fun with the very long straps.
3.0,The top fits but the bottoms are made for someone shorter than me (i'm 5'6&#34;)... they don't even reach my belly button.
3.0,Bracelet is almost too small. It looks like it can be extended. Almost child-sized.
3.0,Very small and shrunk after washing so much I couldn't actually wear it after washing
3.0,"Love it but the pink in the picture is brighter then it is, but still a very pretty band."
3.0,"It's an ok bracelet for the price. No weird smells or anything like a lot of other similar bracelets seem to have on here. But I do have to say, this does NOT go down to 5.9&#34;. The smallest it will go is about 6.75&#34;. I have a small wrist for a guy and I have it all the way down to the smallest it will go, measured it and it was about 6.75&#34;. I have no clue where they get 5.9&#34;"
3.0,Pretty color and I like how it doesn't cut into my shoulders but very hard to get on and off and can feel it all day.I returned 2 before &#34;settling&#34; for this one.
3.0,Not made from linen despite the title of the product nor 100% cotton as the description (I missed this when I was buying it) stated but rather 35% Polyester and 65% cotton. I buought this to have a linen top but nope.
3.0,"Fits a newborn, I ordered for my 8 year old and was disappointed. Super cute though, just tiny"
3.0,"Missing a stone, also a little smaller then I thought but its beautiful"
3.0,"Somewhat disappointed with the color.  The picture shows more of a brown/tan tone, but actually they lean to a gray."
3.0,"Cute design and pretty colors, but some of the disks were damaged and the metal used for the earrings was tarnished. This was also extremely long- I could wrap it three times around my neck- which wasn’t the look I wanted. Returned."
3.0,"Ordered this in plain pink, size L. I have a 36D bust and it was a little tight at the top of my chest, just enough to “tent.” Quality was good, but between the fit issue and color, I decided to return it. The plain pink made me feel older and almost as if I was wearing scrubs."
3.0,bit too small than expected. but nice and simple.
3.0,"This cover up is only okay, the colors are nice and it looks good on while standing but the problem comes in when you bend over. A cover up is supposed to, well, cover you up. This has a small tack under each arm to create the sleeve. Other than that the sides are completely open. So not only do you get a nice side shot of the love handles, but when you bend over, with nothing holding the sides together, the front falls forward and you can completely see the midriff hang out when you bend over...the very thing it is supposed to be covering up. Also it's just not very flattering overall, kind of made me feel like I was wearing a poncho to the beach."
3.0,They fit great.  Just wasn't expecting them to be such shiny material.
3.0,Too big and  does not look really good quality
3.0,"Very cute skirt and the cutout design is nice, although I am always terrified that I'd rip it.  What kills me is the waist band, it's not wide enough to stay in place, and it's not thin enough to just hang comfortably on the hips.  It just flips every which way inside the thin fabric.  I find myself always fidgeting to get it unfolded.  But it's obviously a very cheap material."
3.0,Loved the look and bought new size but I'm 5'7 and 190 lbs athletic. My back barely fit in the SM that was recommended. My poor armpits lol. If you work out regularly go a size up.
3.0,"Right product, but wrong size"
3.0,"These are very fun slippers and my son thinks they’re great! However, within the first couple of days, I had to sew every single ear back on because all 4 came unstitched. The quality of the materials on these doesn’t seem too bad, but they weren’t put together particularly well. But, I was able to stitch everything back together, and added reinforcing stitches in places to prevent further issues. They have worked well for him for a couple of months now with no other problems. So, in all— they’re fun and comfortable for my 8 year-old, but I don’t suppose I’d buy from this brand again because of the quality issues."
3.0,"Not true sleeveless,arm pits too low"
3.0,The charge in the batteries didn't last long
3.0,"It broke immediately, very fragile, it is not made to wear it has its own shape because all crystals are soldered there is not connection in between the stones to move it, terrible but beautiful to put on the shelf, also the model picture looks photoshopped"
3.0,Only one problem I got a run in the leg the first time
3.0,"Not Bad, but, does not flip up high enough. Lens stay in the way and are in your view when flipped up."
3.0,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT COLOR THEY THINK BROWN IS, BUT I DID NOT GET A BROWN HAT, IT WAS MORE ON THE BEIGE SIDE OF COLOR AND DO  NOT MATCH MY FUR COAT. IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY."
3.0,"boots are not really good. Sole is too stiff, leather is also too stiff. Wearing them is not comfortable for feet.<br />i preferred to return them."
3.0,Smaller than expected and VERY thin. But it does fit still and is comfy. It doesn’t have as much fabric as the picture looks like it does
3.0,"Loved the old Dakine version. Being 6'2 and fit, I like the large because it had long sleeves. This version is not the same cut. We'll see how the XL works."
3.0,3 and a half... Just have to get use to it.
3.0,You need to understand that these socks are not for people with wide calves or high arches.
3.0,I like the style and colors but very thin.
3.0,"Damage to shoe, just arrived. :-("
3.0,Runs a bit short
3.0,"I usually wear a large in gloves ...so that's what I ordered,  when received...the gloves were very tight on my hands , I should have ordered a extra large instead ..."
3.0,"The quality of this item is really great, it’s super thick and the material is very luxurious looking but the overall fit of the bust is really awkward.<br />I am a C cup and it still fit really awkward with the same coming up over the bus instead of staying in place, similar to what some of the other reviews said."
3.0,I think all the silver rubbed off before I received it
3.0,it was comfortable and cute but a little frumpy
3.0,"This jumpsuit is really an eye catcher. I got compliments all night. It is quite pretty in person. My biggest problem was going to the restroom in it. It is a MUST to have a good friend to go with you every time you use the restroom so they can help put you back together again. It is extremely short. My butt cheek crease did show and my camel toe struggle was very real lol (wasn't very noticable though) however I am 5'10&#34; and have a longer torso than normal I suppose. I wore it in Vegas but wouldn't wear it anywhere else lol. The next morning I noticed scratches on my thighs and a few on my back. It was from my moving and dancing around so much the sequins tore me up lol. I duct taped my boobs as you cannot wear a bra with this. This outfit is really just for looks, I don't think it's very functional lol."
3.0,Not for women with hips. This dress is narrow all the way down. Even ordering up looked baggy up top and tight on bottom.
3.0,"This hat is ok. The hat does not fit or lookt like the one in the picture, however I will still wear it. Also, it really had a weird smell to begin with. Finally, the hat is a bit itchy. Not the best hat not the worst."
3.0,"My thoughts...<br />Shipping: the wait time was very minimal and was received within less than 2 weeks of ordering.<br /><br />About the Shirt:<br />Pros: The color is nice and the material is light and soft.<br />Cons: Unfortunately I brought the wrong size, with the anticipation that it would run small per the reviews.<br />(For reference I am a 5'5&#34; and roughly 155lbs) Personally I think that a medium size would have sufficed."
3.0,"It arrived in a timely fashion the material is somewhat durable plastic is a little flimsy not as solid looking as the picture, but will dofor gardening"
3.0,It's super cute but came in too bent:( I wish they hadn't folded it up so tight. But after messing with it for a while it got its natural shape back.
3.0,Looks better in the picture than it does on me.
3.0,"Cheap, but nice piece"
3.0,I typically purchase a medium in my workout shorts and thought these would be no different.  They are super tight around the waist to the point that they are uncomfortable.  I wouldn't consider them too small.  I just think the location of where the waist falls makes them feel like they do not fit properly.
3.0,"It’s a cute a delicate necklace . I wear it going out it’s a nice dainty necklace it’s not too long , which I wish it was and the words you can read up close but you can’t really read it far . But over all it’s nice ."
3.0,Not photo chromatic ......  glasses do not ‘tint’ very much at all so if that is important ...move on!  Has a slight gray tint.
3.0,Ordered XL and can barely squeeze my 12.5 in them... there is no way in any universe someone with a size 15 foot is going to be able to put these on. As I cannot get beyond the horrible fit I cannot comment on much else. Oh I should mention that my wife who wears a size 8 thinks they fit great.
3.0,Cute but too small for my taste
3.0,"This sweet little necklace is pretty, but I can't justify the forty dollar price tag. It isn't that pretty.<br /><br />The pendant has a circle of cz chips that are barely discernable. The garnet centerpiece is pink and very small. The necklace will look good on a small neck but will look ridiculous and almost chocker-like on a larger neck.<br /><br />The included chain is cheap looking and cheaply made."
3.0,"Really like the light comfortable fabric and appeared well made. But it is very boxy. Legs very wide. at outdoor settings, you don't want super wide because bugs and weeds easily get in and bite/scratch your ankle area . I returned it for this reason"
3.0,"I love the color of this shirt. My only complaint is that there is no elastic in the bottom, so the shirt &#34;floats&#34; and won't lay flat."
3.0,These are cute . I was replacing a pair similar in style. These are more lightweight and not the same quality but they will work since they were about the same price as the ones im replacing from a few years ago
3.0,"Wonderful quality, but the colors don't match the pictures..... Ash is grey, not champagne-ish like the picture."
3.0,I like the fringes.
3.0,I like it but it could be a inch longer from waist down. Very cute dress though
3.0,The fabric was a lil thinner than expected but for what you pay its decent. It's pretty cute for an evening purse.
3.0,Cracks appeared after stretching 2 pairs of shoes.  This shoe tree works for instep stretching.  So 3 stars.
3.0,It's actually made in a material that's not polyester
3.0,Cute but way to big.i felt like I could fit someone else in the small with me
3.0,these are really cute and there a super good accessory but the color thats in the piercing fades from gold to silver.
3.0,The dress was beautiful but runs very small.
3.0,"Not as off the shoulder as it appears<br />Wouldn't wear in public , there is a weird piece of fabric on the side that sticks out some<br />Great to lounge in the house"
3.0,The shirt fit like it was supposed to but after washing it it faded real bad
3.0,Pants and top feel/fit as two different sizes.  Colors are vibrant.  Material is a polyester type.
3.0,None of the zippers work.  The pleather is just plain plastic.  It is very stiff. Poor quality
3.0,"I'm going to start off with saying that for $5-$6 this is an okay deal. There are some flaws for this as a shirt though. The shirt runs in Women's Small. I'd like it if you could choose the shirt size. Also the picture on my shirt is nowhere near as detailed as the picture they have for the product and doesn't say HANS at the bottom. The details it does have is more just new looking, not the worn out looking detail. Even if it isn't detailed I still think the fish should have a darker outline so you can see it better. But again for $5 this is an okay shirt. Just keep in mind it runs Small."
3.0,The cowl is so long.  Comes to the waist.  I didn't like that
3.0,Beautiful but fragile. Breaks easily.
3.0,These are very thin and cheap.
3.0,"Match perfect for the Apple Watch, unfortunately scratch easily and fades on the long time, almost a year using it daily."
3.0,Dress fits fine except for the extra slack under the arms. The inside sheath liner is a bit transparent.
3.0,"I love the look, but the function is a little lacking.  The one I got is really fast, like, it gains five minutes an hour fast.  I'm disappointed because it's so cool looking, but really, I bought a watch to keep time and it's falling down on the job.  Also, I've never had a watch that needs winding and I'm not sure how to do it.  I'm hoping once it winds down I can figure it out and it'll adjust itself to keeping the correct time, but an instruction manual wouldn't go amiss."
3.0,Measurements 34D-30-42 a lot of my boob peeks out but very cute with high waisted shorts
3.0,"Needed a good work belt. It was nice enough, but the black and brown are very similar in look."
3.0,Not real excited about it
3.0,I love the bands. The only issue is they are a bit big for me. I need a smaller band. But for now they will work out.
3.0,Worth for the price. But the quality is pretty low.
3.0,The fit is great and the material looks great when first wearing but it degrades very quickly.
3.0,bit heavy...but amazing for travelling especially if overweight
3.0,Cute shirt but too small<br /> And it was a 2xl. I didn't want to send them back so I gave them to my mom. Need to get the plus size in a women's plus size. Big girls love Jesus too!
3.0,Material is kinda stretch. Not really loose
3.0,Posts too big
3.0,My daughter love item but the tail is coming unstitched.
3.0,"Tough, unwieldy material, had a slight smell when opened. Left harnesses out for a few days, which helped.<br />No directions on how to put them on. My daughters used YouTube, eventually got them on, but preferred the other belts"
3.0,"It's ok. Nice cut, but the fabric is like shiny, heavy spandex...made me think of rollerdiscos."
3.0,"The necklace was broken when I received it and I actually scheduled a UPS return pickup.  However, I really like this nice little piece of costume jewelry so I got my tweezers out and while it was tedious, I was able to fix.  For $9.99, I'm good!"
3.0,This is not true to size. Very tight snug fit around the booty which makes it very unflattering.
3.0,"The pants fit perfect. Material is light and comfortable. However the button is very cheap, and broke when I unfastened it. And the side pocket is small about 3-4” deep. I was hoping for a larger pocket to fit something other than a survival bracelet in. If those two things were fixed they would have got 5 stars."
3.0,Ordered a large and the cardigan barely reaches my butt (I'm 5'1) and the sleeves are too loose for me.
3.0,Thin material super cheap quality
3.0,"Thin material, easy to tear, but I can work with them because I am losing weight."
3.0,"The only reason why I rated 3 stars is because of the smallest size available no fits well for a person like me that have a little wrist and Unfortunately the seller doesn't have available extra small size.  If you have a little wrist the 5.5 - 6.25, it will be big for you wrist."
3.0,I think this product was very cute but I thought it could have been a little better quality for the price. In the name it says “leather” but it looks and feels more like plastic. Either way it’s cute and the color is nice and it’s very spacious.
3.0,"Great price and shipping time, loved the authentic Harry Potter box, but poor quality, Get what you pay for."
3.0,"Can tell it’s cheaply made, but it’s what i expected for the price"
3.0,Order a small according to the size chart. Returned it for a medium. Length was off unless you would ware flats.
3.0,"Hat seems fine (a bit small for me, yet fits my wife), yet the shield seems too uneven and has somewhat of a plastic smell.  A more rigid shield is likely better (though harder to ship, etc)."
3.0,"This dress was Way to large, when you see a dress on the site, you don't realize the fit."
3.0,I waited to review until I had worn them more than once. The main thing I like on these was the waistbands because they are thick and hold underwear in place..My main complaints would be that the sizing wasn't consistent with each pair .. For example the two grey pairs fit great front and back but the white and navy are loose in the back so they wedge up after a an hour or so ...
3.0,Son son del color que deseaba. Es cómoda y parece resistente
3.0,"They’re very cheap, what can you expect? By mine didn’t even come attached to the hook!"
3.0,Son medias chipi pero para pichar son buenas
3.0,Flower is beautiful the box is nice the trinket jewelry included is very  underwhelming. It perfect for  an elementary kid who has a crush.  Not for adults
3.0,"I'm a 34 D, and the XXL cup pads don't fit me. They kind of just sit in the front of my chest without smoothly covering. The material is thin and isn't as supportive as I would need if I were wearing this out rather than around the house. It is super comfortable though, if you use it more as a non-bra bra. I definitely wouldn't want to wear it out somewhere nice though or with a tight shirt."
3.0,It lasted for about 2 months.  Hand washed....then started to fall apart
3.0,The fit is great but disappointed that the colors arent as vibrant as in the picture.
3.0,Pretty but quite small… disappointed in size by keeping it anyway.
3.0,"It's a good quality material and the color is as shown, but I CANNOT figure out how to latch the back!! Did I get a broken one or is the latch just supposed to be impossible to do?????"
3.0,c throu
3.0,"I bought a neck and face cover from the same brand and had way too much expectations which unfortunately were not met.<br />The beanie is infact quite lightweight and has a lining only the rim of the head , just above the ears.  I expected something more thick for the harsh NYC winters.<br />Also , the size is definitely not for an adult head ( I am a 5'1 woman with normal head size). It keeps slipping off while in motion.<br /><br />I really had high hopes from a Canadian brand for winter gear . This just does not make the cut.<br /><br />I tore away the tags and hence cannot return any longer."
3.0,I usually wear large but this dress is a little to big. the material is ok but I think I would of been ok with a medium.
3.0,Slot smaller than it says....
3.0,They run pretty small.
3.0,The jeans run small but they are nice .
3.0,"These replacement bands install very easily, but they pop off with enough force just as fast! If you were to accidentally hit your wrist against something, it will probably pop the band off of the watch base."
3.0,"Not exactly what I was expecting . Cute date night dress though, or just for going out in general . Not good for work  . Just not good quality fabric ."
3.0,"Wearing these feels much better than wearing a full shirt, much less bulky. My only complaint -the reason I only gave it three stars- is that the blue one has a toxic/chemical smell! I don’t want to send them all back because I really like them. I’m hoping the smell comes out when I wash it."
3.0,"The pants fit everywhere, but the waistband is very tight. It makes them uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,"ok so first i bought a XL. kind of big. though pretty pattern, thin material and a little bit see through. but i liked it.since it was too big I wanted to try a L. so I kept the XL and bought a L. that was too small. so returned the L and kept the XL. washed it. now it's almost too small. wow what a difference. what's up with that? so if i want the same dress in a different color I would buy a XXL. just because it shrinks so much."
3.0,This thing is huge! Made out of a fairly light weight (cheap) metal. Looks really cool though. Wish it was silver rather than light bronze/brass in color. Comes with 2 tack pins on the back rather than the standard one due to its size.
3.0,"Nice, but very slow delivery."
3.0,Pretty color but the material feels thin and on the cheap side.
3.0,"These are great out the box but after a couple times of use, I tore thru the calf webbing while pulling up the sock; every single one I bought… not the easiest to put on or take off but they do feel solid once on… great quality from the ankle down"
3.0,"I was expecting this to be a true tie dye shirt, bleached on a black sweatshirt type of thing. The tie dye is all screen printed on not actually died.. and it's more navy than black. more of a thick t shirt than a sweatshirt. It's cute, just not what I was expecting so I'm returning."
3.0,Super cute but too big in the armpit area.
3.0,"My little guy loves these, and they are his go-to choice when he gets dressed in the morning. They are very cute and if your guy loves Batman, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />The underwear, though, is a bit rough and has almost no absorbency like regular toddler underwear. If your toddler is not having many accidents, that may be okay, but if you're going on an outing and need to have some undies that can hold in a ""I have to go right now!"" accident until you can get to the potty, these aren't the right ones. We only use these around the house for now and use the more absorbent types for errands, etc. These will be fine for when he's having fewer accidents, though, and although they're not soft enough for what *I* like in underwear, they don't seem to bother *him* at all. :)"
3.0,Looks great and fits everything nicely. All of a sudden our credit card chip is not working and I think it’s because of the magnet in the wallet.
3.0,"The graphic looks fine, but the material is not particularly comfortable, and there's no contouring to keep it from fogging up sunglasses. If you fold it in to make the graphics line up, the outer material feels scratchy and not particularly comfortable. The material is very thin which could be good or bad depending on your use. I'd rather spend a few more bucks and get much higher quality material and comfort from Columbia or similar brands."
3.0,"Fabric is comfortable.  The legs were a little shorter than I anticipated, but when I tried them on they were quite comfortable.  After the first wash they shrank and became uncomfortably tight.  They continued to shrink with subsequent washes until after the third wash they became torture devices that I had to toss in the trash.  Definitely not worth the money.<br /><br />I'm revising this review to 3 stars, because the company was very responsive in reaching out to me after my initial review to apologize and offer a 100% refund, which they promptly followed through on.  They also promised to follow up with their supplier to address the shrinking problem."
3.0,"Wanted to wear the necklace but chain is to small , love it cause it’s Elvis but need longer chain."
3.0,"My son likes the designs. If he uses the ear holes, the mask covers his eyes."
3.0,Fit is true to size ..I fead the reviews and ordered a size larger .. ..it was too big . Now I have to exchange it
3.0,Unfortunately it wasn’t what I thought it would be. Material not soft on skin and it makes you feel hot.
3.0,Very cool umbrella. I haven’t had a chance to try it in the rain while it’s windy yet so I don’t know how. It will do in different elements
3.0,i love the quality of material. downfall is it's no joke to order 2 sizes up. i would go 3 sizes up if you plan on drying the shirt
3.0,Its washable you can sanitize it don't stretch too much or they will break in the top  I sew them together they still good and they protect your shoes.
3.0,"I bought these when they had no reviews, and took my chances. I was looking for girly wool blend socks for cold weather, for my infant.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cute<br />Soft and comfy<br />Washable<br />Good colors, as pictured<br /><br />Cons:<br />HUGE. I bought the 0-1y size and they’re at least a toddler size 5-6. They’re unwearable on my infant who wears size 3/6-12 month shoes.<br /><br />Definitely mostly a poly blend, not high natural fiber content. The tagging was entirely in Chinese so I can’t confirm what exactly is in the socks.<br /><br />Edit: it's a year later and my kid is now a size 5-6. Can confirm, they fit a size 5/6 just fine."
3.0,Too big but i still like them.
3.0,It's what it is.
3.0,It's big compared to the size that I was expecting.. looks small on the picture
3.0,"Material is inexpensive,  reflecting the price. It was pretty. The XL was a bit too small for my ample waist. Would have kept save 4 the size."
3.0,"Love the top, but it what appears to be a recurring problem (at least for me) the arm holes are too small. (I am a slight female) The body of the shirt fit fine (size small), but arms holes too small, especially trying to swing a golf club."
3.0,Fabric has no stretch to it. Was snug
3.0,"Loved the jewelry. The set didn't look fake at all, but it did break my neck out just a bit."
3.0,The small would have the color running half way through my chest. Medium was better but too big. Not worth spending additional money on alterations.
3.0,"Dress was comfortable, and fit for the most part but the scoop on the skirt opening seems large, and did not fit against my stomach as it is supposed to."
3.0,"They fit very narrow,  my son couldn't get his feet into them."
3.0,"Came up a little small, but the quality was good. Always order two sizes higher for the perfect fit."
3.0,Runs large but otherwise the product is exactly as advertised.
3.0,you definitely have order at least two sizes larger I  normally wear an XL and this fabric doesn't flex much so it fits a little snug.
3.0,Shoes are beautiful.  They fit a little tighter than I would like...wish I had gone up a half size
3.0,"Leotard is very cute, but very much bigger than the size 6 it proclaims to be.  It was so baggy on my little girl that we had to put it away for a bit... I doubt it'll even fit next year!"
3.0,The strap is thick can push down to your skin
3.0,Runs small and no give.
3.0,The lettering is coming off after 2 washes. Other than that it fits great and is true to size.
3.0,Great retro look.
3.0,"This was nice looking, but just way to small for my big wrist."
3.0,It states no role down but did not stay above the knee!
3.0,I needed these for a dwarf costume. After learning how to slide them onto my ear properly it was easy to do. They worked well since I also had on a fake beard and glasses which helped conceal slight gaps where they touched my head.
3.0,"These look just as they do in the PICT. Fun earrings good quality, but they tend to be a touch heavy and cause the front to hang over."
3.0,"Dress was cute, comfortable, has pockets… but fabric wasn’t of the quality I hoped for."
3.0,"This outfit fit well except for the shorts were slightly big and as the day went on, became stretched and got even bigger to the point I had to wear them with safety pins. I did love how this looked and it served its purpose."
3.0,Theyre great just a little tight on the ear and everytime i wear them i have to take them off after a while cus my ears turn red
3.0,I really liked this tank but had to return in as it runs about two sizes too small. The material is soft.
3.0,"these were not the normal soft snuggly ,  These disappointed me  I kept them because I needed them  but wouldn't buy them again."
3.0,"but this shirt somewhere else, I go t a cheap version of this."
3.0,"i loved everything about this dress except the fit, if you have boobs just go about your way, it won't fit ya"
3.0,Very light weight material. It fits as expected. It just wasn't flattering. It was easy to wash and held up in the washing machine and dryer.
3.0,"Keeping in mind that this is an inexpensive dress, it was nice for the price. There were several loose threads on the embroidered section, which I considered putting some liquid stitches on.  The  bodice fit nicely, which is unusual for me since I'm a 34DD, the band under the bodice was alittle tight but I would have lived with it. The skirt is rayon and lined.  This is definitely a hand wash only kind of dress. Ultimately, I decided to send the dress back because the zipper was too difficult to work with. The zipper got caught in several places and I had to have my husband help me get it up and down. I want to love this dress but I'm not going to own something I can't put on by myself."
3.0,"A bit itchy, otherwise as advertised."
3.0,"Was very nice to use during a 15 hour flight recently, but the sizes seem to run small. They should have an even larger size than they currently do."
3.0,"This is partially my fault and I will be up front about that. I did not look at the picture or the description close enough to realize this product does not use the clips on the Gear Fit2. Thought it seems like a quality construction and will serve it's purpose well, I have to take it out of the band to charge it everytime. It won't connect to the charger due to the construction of the charging link itself (no QI). It's just one more step. Otherwise it's fine and that is why I give it 3 stars as &#34;It's okay&#34; Would be 5 stars if it used Samsungs clips on the Gear Fit2."
3.0,"My son wanted this for a costume so it is fine, but it runs a bit small, so order larger if you are not sure."
3.0,They are cute but the color fades. If I would of known I would of just got plain silver.
3.0,"The shelf is too large. As a result, I spent all day putting myself back in. I ordered a large. I wear a 36C. It fit great everywhere except for the lack of shelf support."
3.0,"Unless you have a big chest to fill this out, if you're under 5'6&#34; the torso section comes down below your hip bones, not your belly button or above like it looks in the image.<br />Otherwise, the color, material, etc. are all as pictured. I think this is a better dress for someone on the tall side"
3.0,"Runs slightly small, size up one or two sizes. Pretty and modest."
3.0,"Rubber is a bit too thick, perhaps making is stronger in one way, but less flexible.  Eventually it just broke.  Prefer the thinner Hidden Tailor for KY  instead."
3.0,nice but short
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e7e2cf167b0bf750bf411e23a93a065f]] This skirt is super cute. It wasn't itchy thanks to the liner. The only 2 negatives I have are:<br />1. The zipper broke the moment I took it out of the packaging and attempted to unzip it. Nothing was blocking it. I think the zipper used for the weight and material of this skirt was incorrect.<br />2. The way the lining was sewed makes it easy to tear away from the seam. I had to re-sew every hem to ensure it would stay in place.<br />Overall, I love this skirt but I could have saved time and money If I just made it myself because the construction leaves more to be desired. I did order this a size larger to be sure I could move in it at a music festival. That was unnecessary. I also added the beads and shells as well as an extra layer of tulle for a fuller look."
3.0,"Great idea, but not practical. I end up getting kink in my shoulder blade when I try to attach all the garters.<br />One of the garters keeps slipping off, maybe I’m not using them properly? Unfortunately there is a serious lack of information on how to use these, through no fault of the manufacturer I guess.<br />Great quality though."
3.0,Colors in person are different than shown on website
3.0,This was a few sizes too small and I had already sized up! Definitely size up several sizes
3.0,The short dont  fit well. And the inside blouse fit  very small
3.0,Sort of cheaply made.
3.0,The top was a little small but still very cute
3.0,Nothing wrong with the shoes daughter just didn’t like them. They seem to run a little wide or maybe it’s just her narrow foot.
3.0,"It's ok. It's a little less quality than you would want for a character to look bald. It's fine for doing life casting, which is what I bought it for. Too expensive for what you get though."
3.0,They could be improved by having a sturdier frame that allowed for less movement of the ear pieces.
3.0,One button came off after just after the second time wearing this. Otherwise nice shirt.
3.0,"The grey looks purple, so it’s hard to find matching tops."
3.0,"Amazon recommended I buy a smaller size but I tried my regular size. Unfortunately, runs really small! Material was not quality I expected."
3.0,"Excellent for the price, serves its purpose and seems sturdy. Fits an adult. Made of cheap, low-quality fabric and lace, but for an undergarment that won't be visible, that's not a deal breaker."
3.0,These were extremely small and I have a small head. Too bad I couldn’t return as they came right before vacation and window was CB closed when I returned.
3.0,"does not fit as well as I had hoped. the stiching on the cups is not great, so the padding slides around a lot."
3.0,It broke easily.
3.0,"This necklace is absolutely beautiful, but the color is SO off.  It is more like a steel blueish grey, definitely NOWHERE near black.  It's not even really dark enough to pass as ""black.""  I bought them at the same time as some black pearl earrings, intending for them to go together, but there's no way because the colors are way too off.  I'm thinking about sending this back, since it doesn't match, but I'm still undecided."
3.0,Beautiful dress but to tight on the top.
3.0,"Great material, but very small"
3.0,This is a long enough coat but fit wasn’t accurate. I got a XL thinking it would be roomy but I can’t get it pulled together. Great look though. Soft and true to picture.
3.0,"These were the softest leggings I’ve ever worn! Mine didn’t come with pockets, which was a feature I wanted, but they were still very comfortable!"
3.0,Well it’s been 6 weeks since purchase and threads are coming out and now it’s falling apart because a string was pulled. Not great quality
3.0,Nice fabric but sleeves are longer than size.  I am a B cup so it just doesn’t fit right. Might look better on a C or D.
3.0,The large is a little tight but the grip is really good
3.0,I'm 5'5 145 pounds I purchased a medium which is a snug fit. The fabric is light weight and fits well over light to medium weight cycling jerseys ok to about 40° to 60°. It didn't last long maybe 10-20 rides the piping around the pockets started coming off after 1 season of limited use. Pockets flimsy very stylish but can't take regular use. Zipper is weak plastic.<br /><br />A shame I love the styling but durability is pretty bad. Wouldn't buy again. I bought it On sale for 50$ I wouldn't pay full price.
3.0,I like the cardigan itself. Nice material light and comfy. It just turned out to be a little smaller than expected on my arms and shoulders.
3.0,"Great everyday bag! Perfect size, lovely color! I've been using it for a few days, and my only issue is it smells funky. Kind of a chemical-fishy smell. The odor wasn't noticeable at first, but it's gotten worse, and is transferring to my hands now. Maybe it's just the blue, as I haven't read any other reviews noting the odor. I'm going to try stuffing it with mesh bags fillled with activated charcoal to see if it can be mitigated."
3.0,Hermoso pero talla no coincide en el pecho y no pude usarlo.
3.0,The only problem with these is the seam that goes right down the crotch so it gives you a major camel toe. But the material and pockets are great.
3.0,Made my ears feel infected if worn for longer than a few hours. But they are cute!
3.0,"I ordered this top in blue and it’s just ok even though I wanted to love it.  I normally wear a US size 2 so I ordered a small. The top didn’t fit me all that well.  It felt fine in the body of the shirt, but the arms are short and extremely tight.<br /><br />The materials used for this top seem to be good quality and are soft.  The strip of lace that runs down the back is a nice touch.  The blues in the top are slightly different colors with the top portion being lighter than the stripes below.  There are some minor gathering spots where the different pieces are sewn together, but once the top is on they aren’t as noticeable.  Overall this top is just ok, I won’t be able to wear it as the arms are far too tight.<br />I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,worked for what I wanted it for.
3.0,"Nice stretch to the fabric but it does show flaws/bra lines. Ordered xl (tag om dress says M, bag it came in says 2xl) and normally wear 14/16.<br />Returning because it just isn't what I was looking for."
3.0,"Cute design, but not very well thought out. The stars don't hang quite right and they fall out immediately if you don't use backs. I have 3 earring holes, so maybe they'd be better on their own."
3.0,Just ok. But you get what you pay for. Ok quality.
3.0,Long/awkward length
3.0,The glasses are a nice style just a little wide for my head. Other than that they are great! They are definitely polarized too.
3.0,"I use it to hold small 1st aid scissors in my 1st aid box.  I can't securely shut it when used for that purpose because it's needs to be deeper for the 1st aid scissors, but it works.  As far as case for eye glasses: it's light weight, and reasonable quality, great value for the money, but I'm not sure it would hold up well."
3.0,The pants where a little too big but the shirt fits great.
3.0,"I liked this dress, it was pretty, but too small and tight all around. I went by suggested size and it was too small."
3.0,"Good quality, but smaller than expected so they are too tight for me."
3.0,"They are very heavy. Took a while to arrive, too."
3.0,"It worked for my needs but its much (much!) stiffer and the material is even thinner than shown. It was slightly more wearable after three runs through the wash with fabric softener. It served its purpose and seeing as how my cat seems to be in love with the material I'll morw than cannibalize it for a cat bed. Next year, when I need a rainbow skirt for Pride I'll go with tulle and not organza."
3.0,2 months in and the paint is coming off. I wear it in an office job so it’s not getting beating up.Shame I like the color and the double magnet
3.0,"Impossible to see in darkness, hands are not luminious"
3.0,"These feel like wearing non-control top pantyhose, only a tad thicker...but just a tad. The perfect comfortable granny panty, if that’s what your looking for."
3.0,It was smaller than the size states. I did have someone that could wear them so it all worked out!!
3.0,"THEY ARE OK, SEEM TO GET A LITTLE DISTORTION WHEN USING AT NIGHT. PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT MORE BETTER LENS"
3.0,not terribly comfortable. I am used to the chamois lining
3.0,I wasn't happy that it was tight . . . They didn't say it came smaller than usual.
3.0,Decent for price. Does look cheap
3.0,"If there had been a larger size available, it would have fit better.  The zipper gets caught about half way up. Otherwise it feels good and looks nice. I swam in it and it was comfortable."
3.0,I was not crazy about the style or sizing on this dress.  I didn't find it appealing on me for the style.
3.0,"The riveted strap itself looks great, fitting an old matte-steel Swiss Army watch perfectly. The leather is also soft and comfortable, sized to fit both smaller and larger wrists. But the buckle is comically large and sticks way out. Fortunately, I had some old bands and was able to swap in another buckle."
3.0,"I wear a women's 7.5 .  These were probably much, much smaller.  Definitely smaller than size 5 US.  Disappointed that the print was only on one side of the sock."
3.0,The color was listed as beige and the picture shown was more of a cream color.
3.0,"These glasses are just what I was looking for...the right style, right color, right price. But so far, not a month later, three pair have broken. What a disappointment."
3.0,"Luggage made to & back from international trip, but it didn't hold up as well as expected. Several cracks and tears in the shell. It might last one more trip, but then I'll probably toss it. My wife purchased a different set by Tag (Vector II) and it held up without any damage."
3.0,"Comfortable, cute, & you can wear just this & I love it. The straps are REALLY thin so they’re starting to fray unfortunately"
3.0,"I liked it, since I have small boobs, but I woulnd't recommend it if you have a wide back or big boobs, because the jumpsuit is a little loose, so it may be uncomfy"
3.0,The card and story are very nice. The packaging looks very nice as well. The keychain itself is very cheap looking and feeling in my opinion. Very overpriced for the quality of the keychain.
3.0,Not as easy as it looks but with effort it does work
3.0,Very pretty but can't wear because too small of fit.
3.0,its hard to move around in.
3.0,"I expected a little bit warmer but this are like a summer socks, very see through."
3.0,Picture was a bit deceiving. A lot smaller than it looks online!
3.0,"The fit of these is awesome, however I wish the material had a more absorbing factor!"
3.0,"Not the same quality as a few years ago. Shirt is too wide, length is okay. Needs ironing esp. collar,  cuffs, and placket. I wouldn't purchase again although the price was right."
3.0,"Super cute but the lupus symbol is just a sticker and wasn't even centered,buyer beware."
3.0,The pants are stretchy and large. The crotch is long. Functional drawstring. These don’t feel like pajamas- maybe loungewear. It’s not thick and there is some sloppy stitching. The top is smaller IMO than the pants. I don’t like the sleeve join is midway down the arm like it was short sleeve and they just decided to add a sleeve<br /><br />The color is great -pants have pockets
3.0,over sized
3.0,This did not fit back into the groove properly. It makes a slight warp at the top. I may have to put my Dremel onto it to grind it down slightly. Other than that - the lens seem great.
3.0,Dress is shorter than expected. Material is thin and light. The zipper keeps bulging outwards at the middle of my back. 😕 other than that it's a nice dress.
3.0,It fits nice and is comfortable but doesn't pull my shoulders back as much as I was hoping it would.
3.0,The Design is very nice but the size is very wrong
3.0,A bit too small... maybe I need to lose a bit of weight!
3.0,I returned it. Just didn't look as nice in person as in the photos. Other dresses from this maker were fine.
3.0,"The sunglasses are very light weight so light weight that they will fall off of my ball cap fairy easy. Glad I bought 2. The glasses are hard to wear when I wear my ball cap because the glasses will rise up above my nose. I can work then so they do fit better with the ball cap, it’s just getting used to it."
3.0,"Tip: Do not purchase, not worth the money. Also, when my Grandaughter opened the case the zipper came UNGLUED and was barely hanging on.."
3.0,It was fine on the bottom and belly but when I bent over too large in the bust.
3.0,"This is a good size, fun, large chain.  I wouldn't expect to buy something like this in real gold - but the links don't quite close and the craftsmanship isn't what I'd hoped.  Fine for awhile - but not a piece that will last forever."
3.0,A bit disappointed. After only a week it started peeling and the color started bleeding. For 20 something dollars I expected more.
3.0,"nice color, just fit me like a trashbag"
3.0,Very cute but very small for XXL
3.0,it fits weird
3.0,Within a couple of days the material starts falling apart with fluffy stuff all over the place.
3.0,This bag was much smaller than I expected. It was advertised as a “teacher bag.”  The 1-inch binder I had would not fit inside the bag.
3.0,I am concerned that this is not leather as stated. I bought two other split leather purses and they are wearing like leather does which is what I like. This one is not.
3.0,"cool, but typical polyester feel, makes me sweaty and runs small"
3.0,Very flimsy and much smaller than I thought it  should be looking a the ad picture. Returning them
3.0,"Light to moderate wind, makes the lenses pivot up, off my face.  Constantly need to flip them back down."
3.0,Cute boots but they run really small. My daughter normally wears about a 2 1/2  so I usually end up having to buy her a 3 in everything. 3 is always too big... except in this case. She could barely squeeze her foot into it and when she did she said her toes were all scrunched in the top of the shoe. I would go up an entire size if you are thinking about purchasing these. These fit more like a 1 1/2 or a 2 than a 3.
3.0,Too small looks larger in pictures
3.0,Nice design but too long for me.
3.0,"A lot more Orange than I thought it would be, see through also. I’d recommend getting a slip to wear underneath"
3.0,This mask would be great if it was just a little bigger.  It easily slips off of my nose while wearing because it barely covers my nose and chin. If you have a small face or are using it for a child it should be great.
3.0,"The string looks faded,  I guess the copper I don’t know what it is,  it’s not shiny, it looks old, nothing like the picture,  very disappointing"
3.0,"I loved the color of this tunic and the length, but it's tight everywhere, and I normally wear a L/XL, this fits more like a M/L"
3.0,"They seem to be very durable and high quality. They look and feel great. They are just insanely massive, way too big. Don't even think about wearing a baseball hat or a hard hat because it's impossible, you look like an alien or a giant bug wearing them. Biggest goggles I've ever seen in my life. Feels like I'm wearing scubba gear."
3.0,THIS SHOE STRETCHER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN 5 STARS IF IT DID NOT HAVE THAT USELESS PIECE OF WOOD IN THE BACK. IT SERVES NO PURPOSE FOR ME. THIS SHOE STRETCHER IS VERY STURDY AND DOES A GOOD JOB STRETCHING .
3.0,My phone does wiggle in the case a bit but it's hard to get it out of the case so I'm going to give it sometime and see if it falls out or not but I honestly don't think it's going to. Even though it wiggles it's got a good grip on the phone.
3.0,"Beautiful, can not hold two keys, only name card."
3.0,I ordered one of these in white and in grey and I am returning the grey one. I feel it is frumpy looking unlike the white . I am 5 9 and 165 lb and I got a medium which fit but I didn’t like the dark camo as much as a white
3.0,The fabric is thin and if it’s tight on you it might rip on you. Not the best quality but the style is nice
3.0,Nice but difficult to pin up since it keeps turning
3.0,Loved hat bad packaging Hat was very bent up. Hat should have been put in box. Great hat trying to reshape it
3.0,Is heavy for our weather. But the item is very good quality
3.0,Cheap as hell but cute. The chain on the necklace is awful but the dog charm is okay. It didnt fit on her collar properly so i had to add a ring to it.
3.0,3$ won't get you quality. the lens had the look as if a liquid had been on them. tried wiping it off but won't come out.
3.0,"The art work is beautiful, the only problem is that paint outlining the top of the bag is missing? Also in a few other places. I not sure but could be the leather is dried out in some area's an the bag is showing creases?"
3.0,I thought I buy large in everything else and bought this a size larger and it was very firm fitting
3.0,After reading the other reviews I ordered the shirt larger than I normally would. Due to my broad shoulders - I usually wear a xlarge in women & large in men...so I ordered an 2XL & it fits perfectly (that's how small it runs)!! I'm loving the look of it
3.0,"This review has been updated after hating these for about a month so continue to read my first good impression to now :-( Just got mine in, I think there beautiful but the picture gives you the illusion that its a  cameo under the plastic outter layer but when you get them they are not real cameos under a protective plastic, its a picture under plastic. Other then that, there are still pretty, they fit great. The backs are a little tricky and some what loose, but not to bad. They haven't come loose yet, so maybe I'm not used to them..but I'm so glad I bought them, I'm very happy with them and I hope they hold up great! I'll let you guys know if they do anything weird lol... But as far as telling other people to buy them, so far I would, 99 %, that one percent is if you wanted a real cameo cuz these are not that... Oh and as for the shipping it was fast and packaged great! -------- After wearing them for about a month now, I've cleaned them about every week or two and every time there's a black/gritty/metallicish gunk that is around the back of the plug, the part that has threads on the front peice and the back peice that is the part of the ring that is the circular threads, I've never had plugs that have done this and it leads me to believe that they are not real stainless steel... I know what is the right type of &#34;gunk&#34; that the ear produces, so this is not from my ear,  it has to be from my plugs. It's not that big of a deal, but it dose irritate the lobe a little bit, so if you have extremely sensitive piercings then I wouldn't get these, unless your just going to wear them for looks and just got a night, i am going to purchase some from another seller off here because if these are not stainless steel then it's only going to get much worse and I wear them for weeks at a time.. I'm very disappointed now I was wanting these to last and hold up great cuz they are pretty..."
3.0,"Well made, but sizes are wrong. I order size 13 and it looked at leAst 3 sizes bigger. I returned them"
3.0,Took a long time to arrive - 25 days & shipped from NY to MT.<br />I like the size as I was looking for a dainty horseshoe necklace but the way this one attached to the chain it sits at a weird downward angle when you have it on. It does not lay flat. The price was reasonable but for the long wait and the weirdness of the piece I returned anyway.
3.0,Tight across the chest but a very pretty dress.
3.0,Unaware of underwires. Dolly Parton could wear the top.
3.0,"I’ve had to purchase these twice due to their flimsy nature :/ although they come wrapped nicely and have a cute dainty look, they are super fragile and can snap easily. I’m lucky if they last me 2 maybe 3 weeks"
3.0,Gift item...its cute but its too tiny . would be a good child's pendant. I bought it for my daughter in law.  Disappointing it so small. Too small
3.0,The ring is nice but the color is not even close. The yellow stone looks more like a light brown. There is no way someone would look at this ring and choose yellow as its color. This is the second one I have bought the first being a red one. The red was more red and much better.
3.0,This tarnished a little too quick. My chain is silver now. But it’s the cutest necklace
3.0,"I bought the sandals for an upcoming trip.  They look nice, but I don't know if they will be comfortable for walking around, casually.  I have not worn them, yet."
3.0,"The bottoms fit just right, but the top was like 3 sizes larger. I tried everything to make this work. Adjusted halter straps, tied the behind the back straps as tight as I could, even added pushup pads and nothing would make it appear to fit. It was like the top was 3 sizes larger than the bottoms. I wear a DD cup size and still did not come close to filling them up. Returned the item with no trouble."
3.0,"And that is a dress made in China that if you dare wash, will immediately fade and disintegrate. Need a one time wear? Yeah totally cute…but these cheap clothes from China are not wardrobe worthy."
3.0,"I usually wear a size 10 1/2 shoe. These are only offered in whole sizes, so I got an 11. I thought they might be a bit too big, but they're tighter than my usual 10 1/2 shoes. They aren't so tight they're unwearable, but the sizes do seem to run small."
3.0,Love this as a server apron. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I have had it for less than a month and it’s already falling apart. I’ve had to sew it up in so many areas.
3.0,"It's cute but too bulky for my nose. The screw part was just annoying and uncomfortable. Despite that, shipping was fast and it is good quality."
3.0,I love the bag and look but it came with a rank smell so i send it back
3.0,I got xl and I’m 5’8” length is short and fits ok kind of for fall and winter because the lining is warm
3.0,"the picture looks like it hits the knees, my daughter has average legs and it was well above the knees. its cute other wise"
3.0,The necklace is beautiful.  I rated based on the fact that it was smaller than expected.
3.0,"I like this bra. Comfy. Cute. Not meant for any real support. Just really light support for like wearing around the house. I am a 34C and got a medium and it fits fine...isn't full coverage, and the straps are a bit longer than I'd like."
3.0,These clips look really nice but they are very difficult to attach to the shirt and tie as they are really tight!  I would recommend others maybe try the gator clip style.
3.0,Too small but good value
3.0,"It's a great mechanism, but they hurt when they are on longer than a minute"
3.0,The colors are uneven in the basket and not the quality I was expecting.
3.0,They Do have a Arch n them♡
3.0,Super tight... I'm a size 5 in jeans and it cut off my circulation... they fit my friend in a size 1 though so if your anything higher than a size 1 maybe 2 they will NOT fit at all
3.0,The small size of this is very small. But would be good for a novice. Did find that the gem easily falls out and the silicon is not as good as the stainless steel. But overall an okay product.
3.0,Cute suit but didn't come above my belly button like I expected. Medium bottoms normally fit me but these mediums were a little more snug. I would recommend ordering a size bigger.
3.0,It fits as expected but tight where the stripes are in the sleeves.  The stripes are vinyl--not fabric-- which was disappointing.  I'll wear it but wouldn't  buy another one.
3.0,I am so happy with my new earrings. They are much more beautiful than they atteared in the picture. I would recommend them to other buyers
3.0,Cute sweater but wrinkles and fold marks after being shipped in vacuum packaging are still very noticeable even after washing.  Hopefully steaming will make them less obvious.<br />Not as soft as I had hoped.
3.0,"I ordered the purple one for my honeymoon. I expected it to be the exact purple in the picture. However, its not. It's not as dark is like bright purple"
3.0,"I got very excited for these but got disappointed, when I wore it with my real gold and diamond 2nd peircing it would look like it's standing up instead of laying flat , also they got me an ear infection but it was on me for showering with fake earrings and they also look fake next to real peircings but if you're wanting to wear them for just one hole they're very sparkly but just take them out before showering."
3.0,I am 5 foot 4 and weight 170ish I think it fits well and hits knee level. It is very cute but hard to zip up alone
3.0,It's true to size. My issue is the length. I'm only 5'2 and it's short a little above my ankle and I don't like that. On me at least.
3.0,"They run small, my kid still liked them 🤷🏽‍♀️"
3.0,"Lovely colors, but snuggles the body. Ok. For someone that wants too show off their curves"
3.0,"Nice necklace, but strung too tight. The beads won't lay flat. Hoping the string relaxes over time."
3.0,Colors great  However the built in bra doesn't give much support.
3.0,"190lbs. 5'9&#34;, 38DD, area where top material meets bottom accentuated my gut which I am trying to hide. Skirt too long for my taste."
3.0,"There awesome but it snags so easily, bleh!"
3.0,"The skirt is extremely short, the zipper would not go up all the way and the strings were falling out."
3.0,"Hurt after a day on them, you cam adjust the width but that didnt make a difference at least on me."
3.0,Nice colors.  I like the adjustable back strap.  Size up so you you can breathe better!
3.0,The color is exactly as advertised very rich and rather nice but the sweatshirt itself is nothing special.
3.0,"Tuve que restaurarlo, no duro mucho"
3.0,"The dress is comfy. However, I am returning it because I cannot stand how the flower patterns don't match up at the seams and waistband. It would be less obvious with a smaller pattern though. I tried a thick, solid black belt to camouflage the mismatched pattern, but it still bugged me all down the back of the dress. I notice it in everyones photos too.  Second, when I put spanx on, the dress clung to them. There was far too much static between the two fabrics.<br />I am a 38c and the top fit nice. It might be too much fabric up top if you have a small chest. The arm length is nice as is the overall dress length. I may try again with a solid color as it is comfortable and easily hid my jiggly stomach."
3.0,I gave a 3 because these where two sizes to small and it came with a hole in the side of the black shirt. Other than that they are good.
3.0,Cheap material.  I probably only be able to get three wears with this outfit.  Very cute though.
3.0,They are nice outdoor sneakers but way too wide. I could probably fit me foot in it if it was long enough. The Velcro strap hangs out so much I keep having to do a double take thinking it is undone
3.0,"not the best for bigger boobs, but overall i did like it. i didn’t wear the bottoms however, because i ordered extra large for the top size. i wear 34d and medium bottoms, so i hat to actually sew the top smaller for it to fit. wouldn’t recommend buying xL if you wear, 30-34d, because it will be quite wide."
3.0,Close enough to original- we will see how it lasts...
3.0,"Size wise it was slightly small around my shoulders, which is not entirely unexpected. I'm 6'0 185 athletic and I usually wear medium. I got the M size based on the sizing chart they provided.I ordered this exactly because its slim fit and snug, and it does fit nicely around my midsection, but I also have bigger shoulders and chest so I guess this is made for skinnier guys. The size is not why I'm giving this a 3/5. The material just looks and feels cheap, and for $40 I think I can do better. I'm still debating whether I should keep this or return it, but one thing is for sure, im not impressed at all."
3.0,"The fabric is fabulously lightweight. Unfortunately, the short runs small and didn't get my body well at all. At least for me, the waist was relatively too small and too short. Seems well made, though."
3.0,I loved the color and print on the shirt. I ordered a medium and it was huge. I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.
3.0,"This is a pretty dress and fit well, but I didn't like the fabric. It was shinier and more slip-like than I expected, so I returned it"
3.0,"Love the material, it’s very easy to breath through. The designs however are not printed like they are in the ad. They are overly large. The skull is printed larger than my own head, and the galaxy print is so large that you can’t even tell it’s a star field. It loses that gradient effect. Still useful, but a bit disappointed in the designs."
3.0,Simply too short on me. I expected flowy.
3.0,"These are super cute and lightweight.  However, my daughter has been wearing them for just a few weeks when the velcro separated from the fabric on one of them.  I could glue or replace it probably pretty easily, but shouldn't have to on shoes that are just a few weeks worn."
3.0,"Didn't fit, so gift was a bust"
3.0,It's nice. Just wish it were a smaller for the purpose I bought it.The width is more like 11.5 inches.  It actually would have been 5 stars if it were smaller
3.0,3 of the watches did not work
3.0,"It’s beautiful dress before you wash it. Stitching is poorly done, especially near the zipper. The color runs, it destroyed my purse and leather jacket because the color rubs off."
3.0,A little hard to see out of
3.0,"I wish the sleeves were just a bit longer, as these are awkwardly around the middle of my forearm.  Other than that, I really like this- it's very thin, but good to go over a cami or tank to stay comfortable in a cold office.  Material will likely get snagged easily and not hold up to much washing though.  Love the baby pink colour though."
3.0,Tardaron en llegar pero llegaron bien.
3.0,For the price this should be a little longer and it doesn't lay right without alternating it.
3.0,A nice big &#34;Trump&#34; watch; but saw a saw a simple Casio $10.00  the next night and bought it  and will give this Big Dial Auto Date Black to someone who wants a more complex watch.  Always nice to give.
3.0,"I got this in the mail today, it’s great quality and cute but it’s the length of a sports bra. I was hoping it would be at belly button level like on the model but it is super super short."
3.0,"The dress overall looks great. Quality embroidery, color as depicted in the pictures. The fit is a bit more loose than I had expected. I got an XL based on the reviews, and I usually wear a solid SM. The ONLY complaint about this dress, which makes me hesitant to recommend, is the blue lining (the slip underneath) at the armpit area. The slip is completely sewed to the dress, and how it's sewed at the armpit area looks really awkward when you have your arms down. The result is simply very unflattering."
3.0,The gem sticks out more than I wanted it get hooked on thing but it beautiful but wished us sat more flush with the skin or sat in a setting instead of prong setting!
3.0,back stripe runs large and cant be adjusted
3.0,"I love your shorts but the new adjusted sizing is confusing. The tag size (the size on the shorts) I prefer are the 34... i used to be able to order based on the tag size but now it is adjusted to US sizes... I ordered a 34 got a 36, then ordered a 32 (36-34 = 2 size difference so 32 +2= 34 I was trying to get), so I was expecting a 34 tag size but got a 33, which fit but  are not the size I prefer. Please fix this or add an option to select the tag size for those of us who know your sizes."
3.0,Didn’t fit like I thought a juniors would. More “boxy” like men’s would be.  Definitely not feminine like the picture looks.
3.0,Bought the correct size for my daughter and let’s just say she’s unimpressed with Santa ability to bring her the correct size of rainbow boots…
3.0,"Very vibrant colors. Looks exactly like the picture, but the top pleats in a strange way of you are not flat chested."
3.0,"The material was different than I expected. It was more polyester, and I was expecting more cotton. The colors weren’t very flattering on me. But it seems like a quality dress, and it fit perfect."
3.0,Runs very small. We bought a size bigger and struggled hard to try and put one on
3.0,"Works for sneakers, not boat shoes though"
3.0,Very cute dress. Sadly I had to return it. The waist hit me in a weird place and didn't look good on me
3.0,too small and straps too short.
3.0,Would love to say how cool this wallet is. The design is very unique and the materials are top notch. It is made in the USA so big points for that. Mine however came with the strap off center making it very difficult to snap. An annoyance for certain but not as bad as sending it back and waiting twice as long to get it back as I had to wait to receive it in the first place.<br /><br />I hope I got an anomaly because I am going to recommend this product it is that unique. Just hope they pay a bit more attention to the small details and good luck.
3.0,"I have a very average sized chest of my build 34c, and I would submit a picture, but the top is just too revealing. It’s strange how the top doesn’t tighten enough for me, yet also doesn’t even cover it all. Was a little disappointed. Bottoms are adorable, it’s just unfortunate that I have to try to find another top that could go with these since they’re so unique"
3.0,a tad high
3.0,Still difficult to put necklace on
3.0,"size guide way off, ordered 3X to be safe and it's like a large. So disappointing, love the dress and couldn't even were it"
3.0,"I ordered this dress in black a few months ago and it's become a go to. It's a bit blousy in the fit but not enough to look sloppy. I just ordered the same dress (same size: L) in navy and holy cats, it's ENORMOUS. Like, two sizes larger at least.<br /><br />It's going back."
3.0,Pretty cheap material almost feels like paper and very thin and see through. It’s cute though.
3.0,I’m 4’10” and this shirt was on the short side for me - but maybe it wouldn’t fall in such an odd spot on a taller person. I like fitted shirts but I like material that has some stretch to it. I ordered the small and it just fit but it felt so tight because it had no stretch at all - maybe a medium would’ve felt better. The shirt itself was really cute otherwise.
3.0,"3 stars only because these are advertised as 'compression' tanks, but they definitely are not. They are form fitting,  but that's about it. They're nice material,  cool, lightweight. Pretty true to size."
3.0,Thought it would be roomy
3.0,I ordered a medium and it fits like an XL. Super soft though...
3.0,Doesn't fit an iPhone 6 plus but cute
3.0,"Waist line is a bit larger than expected, but material is good and feels comfortable."
3.0,"This did not fit how it should have. I haven't had many problems with buying clothes online because I always look at the size charts, but this was too small."
3.0,Kept it since I'm hoping to lose weight - incentive.
3.0,"nice hat, just a little to big even when adjusting didn't fit right"
3.0,ok but would have liked to to be larger
3.0,Warm. Good texture. The Bluetooth has issues staying connected from pocket.
3.0,It is bulky and uncomfortable to handle. I returned the purse. all the zippers and handle are distracting.
3.0,"Item arrive, opened outer bad to find the jacket in a ball with scarf. Item was thrown in like laundry. I opened the second bad and held jacket up to observe.  I saw 2-3 areas with pulls and  on the scarf was a stain. Very disappointed as I needed this for tomorrow... no time to send back."
3.0,R E A L L Y hard to put on. But works great once it's attached
3.0,"It’s a beautiful band. Although the Velcro isn’t long enough to make it snug against my wrist, so the watch turns a lot."
3.0,"You are likely to do more damage to the ring itself trying to apply this sizer. Had a knock off ring to wear on my honeymoon. Couldn't size it so I bought this. Even thought the stone was fake the silver was real and got scratched while trying to use pliers to put on sizer, even though it is pretty obvious how to put it on, it takes a couple tries to get it even and straight across the bottom of the ring"
3.0,This piece was very well priced and and looked better than I had expected. It is very pretty. After a couple wearings though the gold started to fade a bit. However it is pretty and we'll worth the price. I received compliments when I wore it. I wish I had Better earrings to match it tho.
3.0,"Tops fits well enough (big but will work, I guess) but the bottoms are huge. Looks/fits more like an XL than a Medium."
3.0,These pants are beautiful. I was a little dissatisfied with the fit. I am 5'9 204 lbs and I expected the pants to be high waisted. They are a little above belly button waited with a not so comforting waist fit. They are not as long as I thought they would be.
3.0,This appeared to be hanging on a longer chain in the pictures of it.
3.0,"This is a quality dress; however, for me, was not flattering.  I am 5'5"" and weigh 122 lbs.  The bodice made my chest look flat and the material at the top of the bodice wasn't pretty.  I returned the dress."
3.0,No it doesn't lay flat. Like a bib necklace typically does but for the price I'll deal with it
3.0,"I think it's great, but I'll be updating my review after some washes."
3.0,cute dress but not for me.  Holes for arms were a little snug.
3.0,Wish they were larger
3.0,The color is a bright red.  Not rustic like there picture.
3.0,Very light weight and comfortable.  I have larger legs and I thought these would be snug and hold everything in place but don't.  Very comfortable for around the house but not the gym
3.0,I loved the product and color...but the connection between Lux and band broke within 3 Mos. :(
3.0,"Works I can use my phone, however there not very thick if it wasn't for the touch screen fingers  they'd just be normal 99¢ store gloves."
3.0,"I ordered the 44mm and the leather band was cut too narrow and it does not cover the metal bar that slides in the phone.  In time, replacing the band and pulling on it will only make it worse.  I ordered two colors and they are beautiful.  The workmanship is very nice with even stitching and so is the price.  Unfortunately they must go back and I need to go out of my way to drop them off at the post office or UPS."
3.0,sent back too short
3.0,"Cute chokers, however the stretchy choker broke the first time I tried to put it on."
3.0,It is a pretty necklace but it’s color fades quickly
3.0,I was excited to get these for the summer but was a little disappointed with the fabric quality. They are very thin and see through. I don’t think I would wear them out of the house.
3.0,Gloves fit good. One glove gets warm the other you can barely tell its on.
3.0,"Not backless, more like the same v that you have on the front. It is still not a bad little fun dress!"
3.0,"Beautiful but it came as, 1 not as a pair."
3.0,I measured myself and match it to the size chart but the size I got was way too large. The size chart need to be review it's not accurate.
3.0,"My daughter loves this, but the tiny flecks of gems are so small you can't see their color. Overall, it's smaller than I was expecting. She likes it though and she'll probably lose it within the month, so I'm glad I didn't spend too much on it."
3.0,By far my favorite Apple watch band for every day use. Very unhappy with the quality after 20 months of wear.<br />For $80 one would hope the finish would stay on longer than 20 months. Now a spring part that is necessary for attachment to the watch is broke making the band useless. Even with all the issues I am having I ordered a replacement Black size L band and it was over 1/2 inch longer then my old band. My old band measures 7 1/8 inches length. I refuse to pay a jeweler to resize a band that has already cost me $80 plus. I returned the order.
3.0,"The watch is beautiful and works great, however, only half of the band is synthetic fabric. The rest is black pleather."
3.0,Like these but a little smaller then i thought
3.0,I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A COUPLE PAIR BUT TOOO EXPENSIVE FOR MY BUDGET<br /><br />THANKS
3.0,"It's ok. Does fit larger arms. Is silky and lightweight. Has a seam. No compression. The ""silicone band"" is an overstatement. It is similar to the .5 cm strip you find as closures on junk mail. Insufficient to keep sleeve up. If you have muscular arms or heavy but firm arms, this may not be a too big a problem. But is you have larger arms with loose skin or soft tissue, the ""silicone strip"" won't help. I'll be going to a sewing or craft store to find wider silicone tape and see it in. I purchased these to help prevent sun damage on my arms and compensate for 3/4 or short sleeve tops. The rolling down of the sleeve is problematic when I lifting weights."
3.0,Fits every where except for hips
3.0,Not crazy about the material or the silver fastener.
3.0,Fit was too snug for me
3.0,Dress fit way larger then the chart. I was in the middle of 2 sizes so I took the smaller size and it's still too big. Other then that the dress is very nice.
3.0,"My 13 yr old loves it! He said its very comfortable! Down side, the zipper is made of poor quality. Didn't last a day. Having to replace it."
3.0,works as expected .didn't come with instruction manual .doesn't have illuminated watch face ..can't see at night.
3.0,"Overall warm and comfortable. Inner lining is soft and allows enough air movement that your hands don’t get overly sweaty.<br /><br />My biggest issue with these gloves is how much the outer layer sheds. If I rest the glove on my leg, it leaves small black pieces of material. I’ve washed them twice, and still the same result.<br /><br />If that issue was Fixed, this would definitely be a five star review"
3.0,Great socks but they were too big :-(
3.0,It comes longer than expected.  It will hopefully shrink up a bit.  Bought one size bigger because they usually shrink a size.  Shirt hem hits lower hips
3.0,"It was nice, but did not meet my specific needs."
3.0,slightly small
3.0,"three ok, but scratches my back."
3.0,It did not fit as expected. Will return
3.0,"I looove simple dresses like this and have a lot in my closet, ranging from inexpensive to pricey. I was so excited to receive this dress and still felt hopeful as I was pulling it out of the package--it just looked like the kind of dress that would work great for me. Then...I tried it on, oh, so disappointing...it just looks so meh. It looks more matronly than expected on my 5'4"", 115 lb. frame. It lands a little higher on the calf than a true midi dress so that isn't ideal. It isn't lined so it is a bit see through in the light and the worst part for me is the chest area because hopefully you can see in the photo that it is kind of uneven/wavy and gaping...it just doesn't sit right at all, it is wide open. I could remedy it with a safety pin or obviously by taking it to alterations to add a snap closure there, but I feel the dress should have come with that already included. This could have been cute, but because of the cheap, thin feeling fabric and the poor cut, especially in the bust area, this did not excite me at all unfortunately."
3.0,"Boots were nice, I asked for a 7.5 box said the same size, boots were a 7. Fit me a little snug, I hope they stretch a bit."
3.0,"The black rubber cord was much finer than it appears in the illustration (I will be changing that to either a silver chain or a heavier black cord).  The pendant itself is quite nice and reasonably heavy so it will hang well.  Overall, I'd not consider this a good buy for the money."
3.0,I bought this mask during the pandemic covid 19 it's good mask but got one little issue the respiratory filter the one on its side fell off twice that I give a3 star
3.0,is beautiful but too small
3.0,The band isn't durable at all.  It is hard to adjust and I would not trust it to keep my Apple Watch secure on my wrist.
3.0,Very light weight but hangs nicely as a necklace - needs a fine chain though.
3.0,I was so happy when this set arrived. I weigh 131 lbs & 32C bra. I typically wear a small. This set was super tight & my boobs were smashed flat.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:93d0a815820052acbd5d6ad8ef46bdb3]] Bra package with the straps attached. It’s made with good quality, Easy to remove straps to go strapless. If the bra fitted me I would give this 5 stars. I tried to wear this bra strapless and it’s just way too loose around. Bra Run big so this may not work for me as far as a strapless bra which is the main purpose for purchasing this. I needed a strapless bra for a dress I’m trying to wear."
3.0,"I must not have read the material the blouse was made of when I purchased. Admittedly i was more concerned with size and color, because even though it fits to size as described and is very cute on, the material unfortunately feels like you are wearing curtains. For only wearing a few hours at a time it's not terrible however won't be an all day wear like I had hoped."
3.0,"Good gloves, comfortable, only point I have is  kind of curly and let your hand sweat so fast"
3.0,Very small like width wise. it fits good around your body. but im a 34d and got a large and it doesnt even fit all around my boobs.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress as an option for my vacation but it was much too big and thin. I would only feel comfortable wearing this as a swim coverup, but I don’t have a swimsuit in a neutral color to match. I recommend sizing down. I ordered my usual Shein size which is a medium (US=4/6), for reference."
3.0,"The fabric was very thin. I wore a slip with my tights. I wore this in a professional setting, but if this were a “House dress” it would be perfect. For a professional setting you have wear your “church garments”. I made it cute and acceptable for work😏."
3.0,Thin rope ring is ok for stacking with other rings
3.0,"Super cute but fits very small (about 3 sizes)  the pic looks baggy like a cover up, its very tight, but still cute"
3.0,"I was expecting a round(ish) earring, and one side is flat!  That was disappointing....."
3.0,They are smaller than said so just barely fit but I like the hard plastic case they come in.  They cam faster than they said.  I measured my glasses and with the listed measurements they should cover but they are not as deep as they said.
3.0,The stripe pealing off as it arrived was too late to return party was in fear days . I had to reinforced it
3.0,It's cute dress but waist is too baggy. I wish it was tighter :(<br />I'm 5'5&#34; and 125lbs.
3.0,Cute but inexpensive looking
3.0,"I want to love these, but I don’t.<br /><br />First and foremost, they’re somehow itchy. The tag said 95% cotton and 5% spandex, but my boobs itch like crazy whenever I wear these. Not sure why.<br /><br />The shelf bra itself is decently comfortable (aside from the itching). It’s not too loose or too tight, which is a hard thing to find. Good job there! I got a size small (5’3” and 110 lb).<br /><br />The length is too short for my liking, but I can live with that; it barely reaches the top of my underwear.<br /><br />The neck is too high. I wanted to layer these underneath other tank tops to avoid having to wear a real bra. This neckline sticks out about 3 inches above my other tanks (which aren’t super low cut to begin with) and it looks sort of dumb — see picture.<br /><br />All that aside, my least favorite thing about these shirts are the armpit holes. They are somehow too tight AND too loose at the same time, and it drives me crazy. There’s like an inch-wide gap in between my skin and the edge of the fabric that just sort of hangs wide open. At the same time, the hole itself is cut so high that it digs into my armpit and makes the shirt feel super constricting. (Notice how much higher the black is against the gray shirt.)<br /><br />Either way, I took a chance with these and regret it. I’ve been wearing them about a week, hoping to give them a fair shot. They’re going in the donate pile."
3.0,"I had written a good review, but after looking at them closely they were crooked. :( They didn't feel right."
3.0,Very small !
3.0,"I love the dress; the comfort, flattering and long was exactly in my ankle. I bought small size in blue (5’3 and weight 137) it was the perfect dress but I have to give it 3 stars because in the first washes the color faded away and looks like an old dress now."
3.0,it was tight across the front. I had to stretch it
3.0,"Tight fit, zipper seems cheap. But for the price I kept it."
3.0,great idea/product but it just didnt work for me some of the holes on my keys and attachments were just to small so i gave to my wife and daughter and they love them
3.0,I only have two problems. #1) There is no beeping sound effects And #2) the arms don’t extend all the way up for its secondary mode. The only thing is that all the lights work and the arms works ok when it’s in the first mode.
3.0,"Loved them!!! So cute. BUT, The zipper broke the first day she wore them. The front of the sandals were already peeling. And that was only her Wearing them a few hours 😞I'm so sad because they were my favorite!!"
3.0,"The dress quality was nice and what was expected. I really liked the ""swing"" in the skirt. It just did not fit right on my 5'8"" body. The waist hit high thus making it fall wrong. The dress also then hit above the knee more than was pictures. I am sure for someone who was a few inches shorter and did not have a long waist it would have been a great fit."
3.0,"Nice bag, but could be a little wider. Also, it is also impossible to snap the handles together. Plenty of pockets. Works for the gym."
3.0,Won't buy again. Other brands same size fit better
3.0,I ordered a large but they were still on the small side. They are not very soft. More of a heavy cotton material. I am going to keep them but I wouldn’t buy these again.
3.0,These are good and I love that you just push the stud in the stem but the stem isn't long enough for the medusa. It was super tight I thought the stud was going to go right through the whole
3.0,suit was ok buy a size to two sizes smaller was very loose on my legs and upper body
3.0,"Not what I thought & it wrinkles a lot,wouldn't buy again."
3.0,The real deal looked like the picture. The weight of the ear cuff wrap wasn't too bad but for someone like myself...with smaller ears it can be a bit much. But it's a pretty nice ear decoration piece. Definitely would recommend this product.
3.0,"Color is nice, as pictured.  Sweater has an awkward feel.  It crosses low and makes me look fat.  Very low cut in front."
3.0,A little larger than expected. Once out of the package it had a strong chemical oder that could not get out. Otherwise looks great.
3.0,a bit short in the torso
3.0,"Not the most comfortable shoe, but does the job."
3.0,broke 1st time wore it
3.0,"I’m torn on these leggings.<br /><br />Pros:<br />very comfy. I LOVE how soft and smooth they are. The material is stretchy, like rubber band elastic stretchy. not too thick or thin or see through. I get the “naked” feeling for sure and they look pretty “naked” as well, like a second,smoother skin.<br /><br />I run a lot so I put a few miles on these leggings and they held up beautifully. they are supportive and breathable, don’t roll down or sag. Surprisingly didn’t show any sweat despite  the light grey color which is GORGEOUS.<br /><br />The rise is high enough to cover my belly button. Length is great for full length on 5’8”. Sizing was true. 128lbs, I got small.<br /><br />Cons:<br />After one wash (while being in a delicate laundry bag) I noticed loose strings from the ankle seam. I’m hoping these aren’t falling apart already.<br /><br />My black boy shorts undies did show thru these a little. The grey is not 100% squat proof.<br /><br />The bum scrunch looks like a bum hole :/ I even got a second opinion which was the same. I don’t have a big booty so maybe it would look nice if you had a perfect peach like the model. I thought they would enhance my booty, but it only looks worse.<br /><br />I have to go with a solid 3 for these but<br />I highly recommend the non scrunch version!!!"
3.0,"I love the dress, but everything runs small....im a 16 and I ordered a 2x and it was still small....DISAPPOINTED. ....money wasted....won't order again"
3.0,"The body of the dress was not form fitting. So, it looked like I was wearing a sheet. Colors were true to the pictures shown. Sad it didn't work out."
3.0,"Love the idea, but the hat is enormous. it's marketed as &#34;kids size&#34; but it's way too big on me! Also, the &#34;hair&#34; on top is actually a lot thinner (less full) than it appears in the picture. It's cute, but if you're tempted, wait for a sale at least."
3.0,"Pretty, but very thin. Best with a petticoat underneath. But still cute without one."
3.0,"Very cute, but wont stay closed."
3.0,"It's beautiful but I usually wear a 12. I tried 3 times to get this dress in a 14 and 16 and if you have much bust, it won't zip ☹️"
3.0,they are just ok.  Too plastic.
3.0,Probably shouldve sized up but based on a review that women rated true to size I got my regular size. It is soft and sort of comfortable. But again anything coming from china should be sized up.
3.0,I am not pleased that the dress color is nothing like photo
3.0,These are ivory/cream (like the picture) not true white.
3.0,"The fish print is a rubbery texture and not comfortable. The neckline moves around and shows undergarments but that is indicated in the description. The fabric is poly-cotton despite being advertised as 100% cotton. It would be a good beach cover-up but, other than a dress to wear around the house, for me, it is not otherwise appropriate. I will likely buy another but in a black solid.."
3.0,Looks cheaper made than the picture.
3.0,Very cheap.  Material came apart in one area
3.0,"I like the socks because they are difficult for the baby to pull off, but they run small and leave a ring around her leg. I will return and buy a bigger size. Baby is 30# and I bought 24 months."
3.0,Cut very small or Asian sizing doesn’t correlate to US sizing
3.0,Cute little dress. Size runs a little small. I wouldn’t dry it once it’s washed. Almost didn’t fit me.
3.0,"The retaining loop on the original watch band was just about broken, so I figured I would buy a new band. This one looked nice. It has two retaining loops on the strap, but they seem to be one size too small. I really have to struggle to squeeze the end of the strap into the loops. I have never had that problem with any other watch."
3.0,Yes it got discolored after two weeks but I paid $2.00
3.0,"Overall enjoyed this product. You get what you pay for pretty much.<br /><br />Pros: Very cute to wear during summer!<br />Metal was sterile and my belly piercing did just fine with the jewelry ((no infections)).<br />Crystals are very shiny and stunning in the sunlight.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Since it is an upside down belly ring it does slightly move around especially when bending over and being active so i wouldnt reccomend wearing it for any type of sports or anything. just be gentle .....<br />Over time.. if the jewelry was exposed to any type of water , it will begin to &#34;rust&#34; where the ball is to twist onto the bottom of the jewelry."
3.0,"You are sure to find cowrie shell pendants at the local gift shop. They are especially popular in Hawaii. When I was there, every place I went had these. Same thing when I have been on cruises. The girl loves these types of necklaces and if they break, it is not great loss."
3.0,Not a big fan of how they have there name in the sunglasses. Would like to see it downplayed. Ok fit wise.
3.0,I liked the cotton material but it does run alittle on the small side. I normaly wear an xtra-large and is usually loose. This is not the case.
3.0,Received item great quality.  Ordered brown color received more taupe not brown.  Otherwise love this outfit 😊
3.0,They're made well but short on the bottom...looks like I'm wearing capri pants.
3.0,the skirt I received has this print but doesn't have the angeled look like this one does -  it is a straight cut to the floor
3.0,give it a way
3.0,My son used these for a short period of time and one of the gloves on the inside came outside and now we have a hard time getting it back in and staying in. It is now quite uncomfortable to wear because we have to be very careful on how we put them on and take them off. It's sad because they are very very warm.
3.0,Cute hat. nice fit
3.0,"These are great for riding your spin bike at home, but I would never wear them in public. I have a few pairs of high-quality cycling shorts, but these aren’t those. The Lycra is slightly thinner then I would like (low end of compression capability), but the elastic at the bottom leg really squeezes in my leg. It makes my legs look like weird sausages. I am 5’6” 135 pounds and got a size medium, which fits, except for the weird sausage thing."
3.0,I wear a medium and ordered this in a medium as well. I love the outfit but need to order in a size larger!
3.0,a bit see through
3.0,"I was a little scared about ordering this item. The fabric feels strong to the touch but when you wear it and bend you can see your undies. So it's a mayor fail for me, was hoping to use it for leg days but due to the see through thing won't do it. Also it runs a little large."
3.0,"I liked the material and the fit, but I washed it once and the seam where the pocket attaches to the dress started to come undone. Little disappointed. I did really like the dress."
3.0,Great fit except in the chest area
3.0,"Love the shoe. Not the most comfortable. Tight thru mid foot & kinda hurts my toes. Next size up might be too big though.  I ordered 8, usually wear 7.5 -8shoes"
3.0,Fits and all but feels cheap
3.0,It’s no the color it was supposed to be but it’s really cute I wish it was the right color though because it’s not as pretty
3.0,"One buckle works great, and one buckle won’t stay buckled under any real pressure."
3.0,"This is hardly a dress--im only 5'6"" and the sides of this ""dress"" were so short that my hips were exposed. The back and front go down to acceptable dress length, but there's no way I could wear this without leggings under and I bought it to be worn on its own. I would call this a tunic length shirt, not a dress."
3.0,Looks like nothing in particular....
3.0,Service was great but sizing was super super small
3.0,Loved this tshirt when I got it but not so much after the first wash. I washed it inside out in cold water and the writing still faded to dull dark gray. No bleach and laid flat to dry.
3.0,"I ordered these pants primarily to use when fishing in my kayak, because they were described as “waterproof” in the listing’s description and photo. I tested them on a kayak bay fishing trip. You can imagine that you certainly get wet when using a kayak. The most important thing to know about these pants is that they are definitely not waterproof. I wouldn’t even call them water repellent, as the description also states. The photo of the water repellent action in the listing is not at all what I observed with these pants. After the first few splashes in the kayak the legs were completely soaked - and the water even got the inner fleece lining wet. By the time I finished the trip, the pants were almost completely soaked, and did not dry quickly. (Just to be fair in my assessment, I later held the pants for less than 5 seconds under the shower, and the results were the same. The pants were immediately soaked in the same way.) The description states that these are snow, ski, and hiking pants. I have hiked through - and skied in - lots of different kinds of snow in my life, and I can only imagine the result would be the same in snow as it was being splashed with water. All of the ski pants I have ever used were completely waterproof. These pants are not. This is the main reason I have deducted 2 stars from my overall rating.<br /><br />PROS<br />Despite the above major issue described above, there are several good features about these pants, as follows:<br />They are lightweight, weighing only 1 pound.<br />They are well-made and the stitching appears to be of good quality.<br />The inner fleece lining should provide some protection from wind and cold (but I wouldn’t call them heavy duty cold weather pants), as long as it doesn’t get wet.<br />The nylon/spandex material is soft and very flexible. The stretch points, such as the knees and the hips, are very comfortable, with no binding or chafing.<br />There are two upper pockets, which are sufficiently wide and deep, with nylon linings.<br />The two lower pockets have zippers and their position provides easy accessibility when in a seated position (such as my kayak).<br />There are two rear pockets with metal snaps. (I wondered if these might eventually rust or corrode in salt water, however.)<br />The waist is expandable.<br />The belt is well-made and the unlocking clip mechanism is easy to use. It is a loop type belt (which is not my favorite type of belt). Once you adjust it for your size, you shouldn’t have to adjust it again, though.<br /><br />CONS<br />The pants are not waterproof.<br />The waist button is plastic and not particularly well-secured. I might have to get out my sewing kit after awhile.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />These are well constructed, high-quality pants. They are comfortable and flexible to wear. The claim that they are waterproof is misleading, as they are definitely not waterproof. They would still have multiple outdoor uses, such as hiking, if you are not concerned about water or rain."
3.0,"Perfect, they adjust automatically with the spring out hinges.  I will buy again."
3.0,"Not the highest quality.  It seems as though it is made from wool, though.  It's just, somewhat, poorly constructed.  The tab on the top of the Fez can easily be removed from the hole that it's in.  It's not secured in place by any type of sewing.  Also, the fit of the Fez is larger than expected."
3.0,It just got chilly enough to wear these so I Can't comment on the warmth issue yet. They seem a little short in the back and so they flop off my feet sometimes when I walk.  I've never had this issue with my big feet B4.  I'll try different socks.  They are cute and different looking than the standard store bought ones.  I got them for in the house and to the mailbox use and should be ok for that.
3.0,Overall too large (ordered a small) but the dress and fabric were good
3.0,Fabric is a little rough but sturdy. Had to return because for whatever reason the waistband is super tight. EVEN with a size up it only changes the leg room
3.0,Nice flare at the bottom like I want but super thin and didn’t know they were racer back. Had to buy new bras for them
3.0,I loved the material i just wish it was the right size i dont know if i ordered the wrong size or its just tooo tooo small.
3.0,"Gets the job done, pocket clip broke off almost immediately"
3.0,"This is the second Pikolinos pair, I bought. The first one was a perfect fit. My feet are narrow and this pair is too wide. The quality of the shoe is really good. The leather is soft. I wear the shoes with shoe sole inserts but the fit is still not great."
3.0,"Very low and cheap quality but from distance looks great, closer you’ll see details showing the low quality products made from China, you decide."
3.0,Run small and short
3.0,Good product. If you have any reaction to cheap metals they may turn you a bit green where ever you wear it. I had mine done into a quick release paracord bracelet and started sweating a bit and noticed my wrist was green from the shackle. Metal wouldn't do well on my wife's skin at all since she reacts worse than I ever do to cheap metal being used. Not a total bad product though. Handy having a compass when out in the back country doing some hiking.
3.0,I usually wear a small but I wanted these to be loose so I bought a medium and they were still too tight.
3.0,"Direction are not that great, too easy to mess up the wax. They should send at least one spare wax piece."
3.0,it said mens sizes so I went down. then it was too snug. love the logo though!
3.0,Beautiful necklace but came in a small bag and was completely tangled up. It took me a while to get all of the knots out. Packaging could be better!
3.0,The fit was tight.
3.0,Good size but I wish it was more sturdy and would stand without falling down. I do like the two individual zippered  compartments.
3.0,You can do way better. Buy two other bands for less $ than this for interchangeability.
3.0,When received some of them was broken but other then that they are cute
3.0,Bought these for my upcoming trip to Italy and I love them. Very cute and comfortable! They got to me quickly and look like good quality.<br />Edit: They broke within my first few days wearing them!
3.0,"Dissatisfied with qualify, not like the old stuff"
3.0,Bigger than I expected them to be. One of the screws holding the arm on is almost coming out. Had to go to a glasses place to get them tightened. Besides that they okay. Don’t recommend this brand. Wouldn’t buy from them again sadly.
3.0,Nothing to write home about. Very thin inexpensive gloves.
3.0,It's adjustable. ..great item
3.0,Pretty but....Had to send it back...the odor was too much for me. Even tried to let sit outside for a while.
3.0,"I ordered the blue sleeved one. The blue sleeves are BRIGHT royal blue, not navy blue as shown. I always wear XL and ordered XL. The fit is perfect. Bummed about the color of sleeves. Otherwise it would be 4 stars. The quality is just ok but I expected that with an inexpensive t-shirt."
3.0,"Looks great.  Material and build quality average to good.  Some fraying has occurred after 1 week of wear, which I've had to singe with a lighter. Note, it is actually 10.5"" long (including buckle), not 12"" as in the description.  This shouldn't be a problem for most wrists, but if you intend to use over a jacket or wetsuit, it probably won't be long enough (most NATO straps are 11-12"" long). I have 7.75"" wrists, and it's just a tad bit short (it buckles, but there is not enough ""extra"" strap to go up and fold back into the NATO loops."
3.0,The mesh part was torn when I received it
3.0,For some reason the black ones ride up. But made very well.
3.0,"...I'm a bit concerned about the durability. It's thick enough, and the buckle system is easy to use, but the nylon is cut (and appears to be hot glued?) in such a way that I fear that the leading edge will  begin to fray over time.<br /><br />Other than that, they're attractive and hold just fine."
3.0,Images are not as sharp as they should be compared to other glasses at the same price and magnification.
3.0,"The glasses don't fit in the case, which renders the case useless. They are very big and slide down my nose a little, but they are cute."
3.0,Cute but I thought the shiny part was detachable. It’s hard to get on and off.
3.0,"IDK if China has a different system for measuring but these are all just a tad smaller than all my other plugs, I checked against ALL of them and they just aren't the same size. So they work but not great"
3.0,Chep but thats what you pay for.
3.0,"This is a nice quality sock. Very thick and more of a compression fit.<br />However, it will not be a good ski sock. It is not warm. In fact, it is a little cooling.<br />I’d get a sock with some wool in it if you want to keep warm."
3.0,"I like the top , just too big . Not true to size,order one size down. Going to send it back for smaller size. Material felt great and good length for tunic."
3.0,"I bought this as part of a costume.  It is perfect for my needs.  But definitely runs small.  I had to exchange it for a larger size.  It is also meant to be quite form fitting, so I ended up going even another size larger to make it more comfortable for me.  But quality isn't bad, and as I said, it is perfect for my costume needs."
3.0,Cut small and very very short
3.0,"stretchy but almost too stretchy came a little big and was confusing to put on but once i did it, it was cute"
3.0,Will hafta figure out how to keep it from turning my ankle black.... ok for the price.
3.0,"Flimsy chain, changes color fast.  The pendant is very heavy, and great quality, just wished it came in a heavier chain.  It will probably  break on the next wear."
3.0,Esta bonira pero no es lobque yo esperaba
3.0,The jacket is very cute and lightweight. Definitely true to it's size. I still think it's overpriced because the material is cheaply made but all in all I still loved it for what I needed it for!
3.0,They are very pretty - but much to big.  Seller was great and sent me a smaller pair but they were not much smaller and they were supposed to be a gift
3.0,Very nice to just runs to small
3.0,I really like this necklace. It's cute and goes with anything. I'm a fan of bolder jewelry and this is pretty dainty. But it is very cute and looks great for those casual outings. It does get knotted very easily. But it is cute.
3.0,I gave it as a gift to my nearest one. He loved it. It is good for biking (cycling) and jogging.
3.0,Low quality belt
3.0,"Nice looking from the outside, color good. The inside fabric is of low quality which will not last long, will tear & shred with use. Don't expect this to be a long lasting purse."
3.0,Never saw underwear like this before where one runs smaller than the other from the same package ?????  Price was good so I will not be bothered returning  them but send them to my nephew in Cuba.
3.0,Not for someone with a long torso. The bottom of the bathing suit went on like a dream and then when I tried to get top up it barely covered my breasts.
3.0,Not sure if it will fit her neck or not as it is a gift. It does look a bit small though so I'm worried that it won't. I can always change the chain if I need to. Maybe would work better for a toddler under 4.
3.0,"Bought it for the hubby. He's a size XS. The XS shirt was a snug fit and it's pretty short. He has a long torsal so the shirt makes it look like a shrunken shirt. The design is still good, shipping was good, and a regular normal T-shirt quality."
3.0,"I ordered 3-4t, but it is too big for my 4.5years old daughter. So I had to return."
3.0,"The ring itself was very nice. The sizes run small, so if you order it order one size larger than the ring size you wear. I had to return mine and reorder a larger size."
3.0,Small but allows for a passport and few additional card/docs max.<br /><br />Constricted my calf but rode down leg unless placed high.<br /><br />Less obvious when worn than some others.
3.0,"The material of this jogger is soft and its very easy to put on. And I fell in love with the material. I do not own any blackish green and its a beautiful color. It has pockets which is a plus. However, the fit it slightly odd. It looks like a curvy pair of jeans but, the fit is very odd on me. This is definitely made for skinny tall ladies. Due to the fit, I am giving this pair of pants only 3 star."
3.0,They seem more flimsy than I expected but are doing their job. Just worry about longevity.
3.0,"It's much larger than my Infiniti key fob. I could actually fit two in here. I wanted something smaller, but this will have to do."
3.0,Really nice but after a few weeks the inside plastic cracked at the corner. But still workable.
3.0,"I like it, just kind of sits weird on the shoulders."
3.0,Did not receive both earring backs.  Was looking forward to wearing them and one without a back did not make me happy.
3.0,It’s nice but it broke within 3 weeks of having it
3.0,"Nice shoe, preferred the more covered foot to the open one, but had to return much too narrow for my foot to fit in. Length was OK but the bands at the bottom are not adjustable. Paid $4 return fee."
3.0,I bought these sweat pants because I love cotton clothing and I also thought they would be a little baggier beacause the picture makes them look roomier. If your looking for a stylish/roomier sweatpant then these are not the ones. they hug your legs tight and make a thin person appear even thinner. On the bright side they are very comfortable and warm.
3.0,"The dress was lovely when I put it on, but the fit was a little off. The top fit fine, there was extra room in the stomach area, but  it was tight and small in the hip area. The split in the back was all the way up to my crotch. I may try a larger size and sew the split closed lower."
3.0,"I like the oyster turquoise colors, but the earring is smaller than I had anticipated and the colors are not vibrant as in the pic. I’ll keep them anyway."
3.0,"Nice hat, comfortable."
3.0,"Great Maxi, slightly see through however."
3.0,"Very comfortable, but not much support."
3.0,average quality for the price..do not expect them to be around fora long time as the cycling brands
3.0,size fit larger than sizes on chart....buy one size down for proper fit
3.0,"It is cheap and falls apart super easy.  A one time use kind of novelty.  But as inexpensive as it is, it is fine and colorful.  This falls directly into the ""get what ya pay for, expect nothing more"" department."
3.0,Not a great fit at all.
3.0,scratchy as hell
3.0,"My feet are narrow, so these shoes did fit, although they were very tight. They looked a little weird to me too, like the shape was odd on my foot. They are fairly easy to walk in if you are used to heels. I'd say the heel height is about 5"". Also, the pair I received looked as if they had been worn many times already. The color was starting to rub off in some places."
3.0,I have a small chest and there still wasn't enough room for them.  The rest of the gown was baggy so not a size issue.  Must be a proportional problem with the way the gown is constructed.
3.0,Really tight on my upper arms. Other than works great.
3.0,"Relatively nice fan deck however I'm disappointed on several counts. The color cards are nice.  I like that they do not have a sheen that allows the color to displayed more accurately and I also like that they have the name of the color printed on them, however, the color cards are thin - very thin so I question how long they will last.  I am also disappointed that the pouch that others display with their reviews is not included with my purchase.  This would go a long way to protect the deck and help extend the life expectancy.  This is my first Color Me Beautiful fan deck purchase, I have an Autumn Fan deck from Color M.. A Seas.... (Abbreviating since I'm not sure I can use the name) and IMHO it is far superior not just in quality (thick stock color cards), but in the number of colors, size, and the fact that it includes a protective sleeve; it was also less expensive ($8) which is an added plus. I look forward to using my CMB fan deck just wish it offered a little more for the price point."
3.0,material is not what I expected as all. Pattern is not as detailed as shown.
3.0,It was a combination for the return being that the material was not as she expected even though did come as described. Also she said the fit was not what she was expecting even though it appeared to be her right size. Overall it might work for some but it did not work for my mom.
3.0,Socks are what I expected but I thought for some reason they were not made in China. They are. I’ll be looking elsewhere for my next pair.
3.0,"this is a vibrant and beautiful bracelet.<br />however, I guess I didn't read this correctly.<br />according to the pic, it looks as though it is a &#34;wrap&#34; bracelet with stretch.<br />it is NOT.  it is cut down the middle on one side to slip over like a cuff bracelet.<br />which is fine.  I will still wear it.<br />but I won't buy another."
3.0,Lovely but gave it to my petite relative looked better on her
3.0,Somewhat large and just really thin so shows every lump and bump. I didn’t think they we really flattering on me so I returned them but the quality was good
3.0,"For the most part, nice checkbook wallet.  Only problems are the slot for your drivers license isn't long enough, cuts off view to you have to pull it out.  Other thing is...OMG do people really have that many credit cards?  I found way too many slots for me.  Where check book would go has credit card slots and one side of the check book cover also has credit card slots.  These credit card slots are overkill and creates too much bulk to close the wallet."
3.0,"Love it, the only thing I would say is that it’s a bit shear at the top. I normally need a camisole underneath"
3.0,I’ve gone through about two pairs of these slippers in the past 6 months. The memory foam that is supposedly used in these slippers gets compressed very quickly after about a week. They felt really comfortable for about a week but they don’t last very long. The memory foam quickly developed amnesia making these slippers feel like you were walking on bulky socks. I found a cheaper pair of slippers at a local box store. Doesn’t have memory foam but the cushioning holds up even after 3 months.
3.0,"The bottoms fit great! The top is fitted for those who are maybe an A or B cup size. lol I purchased the large Just in case. I am a 34 DD size, sometimes for swim tops I can make it work. This top was not pleasant, I was completely falling out. There is only one setting for the clip in the back, not adjustable. Being the size I am, the band around my back was loose, the cup size itself was too small. Recommend if your smaller chested but not for those who have a little more to cover."
3.0,It was good but the bar was bent when I opened it up so probably shipping fualt other than that they was a good gift
3.0,"The top is really cute but not on me.  I am too heavy and this top (36DDD if this helps) was not flattering on me.  I do not believe going up a size would have helped.  The material doesn’t give at all.  With many items, this was gifted to my daughter who loves it and is a b/c cup. Also, it was a size large that should have been too big for her.  But, it wasn’t."
3.0,"Nice, but smaller than I expected"
3.0,This item is of very good quality but when its worn it keeps slipping up so I have to keep pulling it down.
3.0,After one wash the material is faded as if its been washed a dozen or so times.
3.0,"For the price, these pendants were just ok.  I gave as cheap girl gifts for Christmas.  That's about all they could be used for."
3.0,The shoes weren't very stiff. My son couldn't walk in them as he is used to a bit more structure.
3.0,"I just got these today. I wasn't expecting anything wonderful because they are not expensive, but these are so badly sewn that I would label them as irregular at best.<br /><br />Not only that but it seems that someone has even worn them or tried them on...those marks in the last two photos are evidence of that...a return maybe? They are dirty as well. Yuk.<br /><br />On the other hand, they are super comfortable."
3.0,the gemstone side are small and like to try to go through the hole in the nose. Great price other then that
3.0,Mask are too big when open to display design. Mask made from is slippery material and weird flap to hold stiff filter filter. Overall weird fitting mask. But I like the Christmas theme.
3.0,"The earrings are cool. But the picture makes them look blue and red. They are actually pink and teal. Not a huge deal, but I bought them to wear with a specific outfit and that will not work now."
3.0,"I love the material and the tie waist, but I felt the gap/split was a little to wide."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress. Unlike other negative reviews, I actually really liked the pattern, and as most reviewers said, it fits true to size and is very comfortable. However, there are weird darts sewn in the chest, which really don't serve much purpose and look out of place. Moreover, although the dress wasn't particularly tight, the darts started coming unraveled after two wears. I don't think I'll be able to wear this again (maybe with a sweater to the grocery store, but that's about it), which is a shame, because it's otherwise very pretty."
3.0,The quality is great.  It just doesn't match the samsung watch color very well.  It also doesn't flare out at the connection point for the watch making it look just not right.
3.0,I bought the print one and it is ok. Not a huge fan of the material. It is also brighter then the image making it less attractive looking. It runs small. Still debating returning.
3.0,I like the separate slots for my cards. I do not like the section for holding your money. The pocket is not deep enough for the money to be fit totally inside the flap. A big minus in my opinion.
3.0,a little heavy to wear.
3.0,"Gift to my Brother! He's Size 7-1/8"" cap. This Cap is nice except it's too big for heads slightly towards the lower end of the measurement range! An adjustment snap or velcro strip adjustment wud make it perfect! A strong wind will blow it off your head!!"
3.0,Too small. I wear an 8 in a bracelet and this didn’t fit. Will give it away as gift.
3.0,"It does look like the photo but it's not very high waisted. I would say mid rise instead. But a warning though, it does make your butt look like you have 4 buttcheeks instead 2. It's as if I was wearing those package panties. I would perhaps go a size up."
3.0,Not a winter piece.  Very thin.
3.0,For the price of 9.99 I guess it is an ok buy but it does not seem so brilliant as shown in the picture. It is cute but is lost when I wear it..not for everyone I am afraid..
3.0,The legs are tight (I have a roughly average build) on a large size. It will probably relax some. During use the cup slipped to actually sit sideways inside the pocket. This is really a problem if it ever ends up needing to protect.
3.0,They shrunk. I guess I shouldn't have dried. The fit was perfect.
3.0,"I can't complain too much about this product for the price. The only problem I really had is that even wearing the garters high on my leg they still wanted to slide down. They also did not lie flat on my leg for long, the lace bunched up and rolled. But ultimately they served their purpose. I was impressed with how beautiful they were, the color was perfect and the flowers are really cute. The lace isn't a super great quality and I don't think it would have held up well for much longer. I only wore mine for the reception because I didn't want them to fall off during the wedding."
3.0,Much larger than expected.  Look similar to fake gauges. Perhaps with the right event to wear them to ?
3.0,T shirt was more of a man’s cut t-shirt. Except for the attempt on the neckline to make it seem more like a ladies shirt.  Would not order again! And will check company name so I don’t ever order a t-shirt from that company.
3.0,"Honestly, It looked like a tent on me.  Too large to and bulky"
3.0,Wasnt<br /> as expected
3.0,The items does not fit as displayed. Body typed displayed is of very very petite and short. the illusion sis not for an average thin body type as mine. Nothing wrong with the dress just not fitting as shown. I ordered the largest to get the swayed looked.
3.0,"I think I would like it if I had the right size, the sizing chart is WAY off. When I returned it there was no exchange option so I'm just going to try and find something in a store locally to avoid the odd sizing/return issue again. I would really recommend that the company put up their own sizing chart. I have a 36&#34;C bust and the large was too big- The neck was the only part that fit, color was as expected, fabric was soft, seams appeared well sewn."
3.0,Not what I really needed tho
3.0,"These socks fit loosely, which I kind of like since I don't like socks that bind, but they are scratchy and the stitching at the toes is wonky, which makes them hard to wear by themselves for the whole day.  However, with a thin liner sock underneath, these are decent boot socks since they have the Ragg look and are a nice length so that they rise above my ankle boots.  The liner sock is also necessary because even though these socks aren't exactly thin, they aren't all that warm, either, since the weave is kind of loose.  I don't think I would buy them again, but I can make them work for my purposes."
3.0,Nice but BIG
3.0,"I like that his jacket is long, but I’m not happy that I ordered a size up (M) because I wanted it to be big to fit bulkier clothes under it but it still is snug without the bulky sweter!  (I’m 5’2, 115lb) I usually wear a small and ordered a medium but feels like very small small."
3.0,Not true advertised size.
3.0,"The order came at on time,which I appreciated.<br />The purple was more maroon than purple but goood quality."
3.0,Cute concept but cheap material. It has alread ripped and I've worn it all but 2 times.
3.0,"I found the socks to be comfortable except for the top elastic band. That cut hard into the back of my calf just below the back of the knee area. Otherwise, they were great."
3.0,"I thought it is longer (there's a picture showing it almost reaching the model's belly button area, but mine doesn't go below my chest.. I think they used a 10 year old girl for the photo since I'm 5'3&#34;). Also, before wearing it for the first time I kept it hanging in a jewelery holder and after a day I found it fallen on the ground with a chain broken. I managed to fix it, but it appears to be flimsy.<br />It does look good other than that."
3.0,"The top is very cute, but runs very small. I usually wear a large/x-large, so I ordered an x-large and it didn't fit. I could even get it over my boobs. The fabric doesn't give AT ALL. Other than that, it is an okay top. Lovely color and design, just too small. I am sending it back."
3.0,"While this is a great watch band, after having my original for a while, the screw in part of the pin fell out and was lost ,  ordered a replacement band and when that arrived, open package it was shipped in and found NOTHING, manufacturer package had a box cutter type cut and was missing everything .  Amazon is sending me a replacement and hope this time it arrives as it should."
3.0,"This is a beautiful wallet, so I was sorry that I had to return it.  I was able to put all my credit cards in it, but it then would not close properly,  The snap would close, but the wallet appeared to be bulging.  It might have stretched and softened with use, but I didn't like the way it looked bulging, so I returned it.  The red is neither blue nor orange, nor is it a dark red or a fire engine red.....really a beautiful color. I would recommend it if you do not wish to carry as many as the 18 cards I put in it."
3.0,Trying to unscrew & screw the backs take a long time.
3.0,The chain was broken so have to buy another chain. The stone part is very pretty. I just hate I couldn’t wear it right away.
3.0,"These sandals are very cute and easy to put on. However, the attachment point of the strap on the inside of the shoe causes discomfort and friction on my little ones foot."
3.0,"They are fine for a summer season, not sure if the material is enough resistant for next year."
3.0,The fit and grip of these gloves was OK but they have a very strong rubber smell that remained on my hands  after I removed the gloves.
3.0,It's just okay.  Not really my style so I'm not sure why I bought it.  Impulsive.  It's a little bit small.
3.0,Watch has a defect on the resin watch face.  See picture above the number 8.  Either a crack in the watch face or defective product.  I will return it.
3.0,cute but runs small in chest
3.0,The back and. Shoulders are not what was pictured in the advertised picture.
3.0,Ordered my usual 6.5 and they seemed like a whole shoe size bigger...
3.0,Looked cheap and the color was not as crisp as it looks on the picture
3.0,The pants don’t have pockets at the top like normal pants do they grey ones look more like the green camouflage ones and the small is more like a medium
3.0,"eh, ok. small fit and I sized up."
3.0,"These pants are lighter than your normal yoga/workout pant.  Length is good but they run a tiny bit small.  I'm not fat, but a solid woman.  I wear size 14 and no matter what product I order, I always order a large.  These pants are running a little small in the rear.  I find that I keep pulling them up because they are slipping.  I would still recommend them and will likely buy them again, just one size up."
3.0,"Quite small, barely fits my small glasses"
3.0,"This dress is beautiful! I love the body suit underneath too. But I'm 5'10"" and have a long torso, so it pulls on my shoulders and  flattens my chest. I even sized up.. If you're average height you'll love it!!"
3.0,"If I didn't have to pay shipping, I would have sent these hats back.  I felt they were made very cheaply and one came without the attached ribbon. The ribbon is just that...a flimsy piece of cloth you stick into the hat to help it stay on.  It also had a price sticker attached of $3.99!!!  Talk about being ripped off. The only reason I kept them was because my daughter really wanted one for her birthday and I was out of time to have something better shipped. The only good thing about this hat is that it is lightweight.  Next time I will pay a little more and hopefully get a hat of better quality."
3.0,"Measured old laces and were 60&#34;. These were listed at 63&#34;. Slightly longer, but should be ok. When they arrived they actually measured about 68&#34; and stretched to 72&#34; or more when tightened and tied. Will make them work but not as advertised. Otherwise, decent quality, prompt delivery."
3.0,"Soft material and fits at the shoulders but far too short in the torso, barely covers my belly button."
3.0,GOOD PRICE FOR THE QUANTITY. THEY HURT AFTER A WHILE IN THE EAR. THEY DO LOOK GOOD YOU JUST HAVE TO SUFFER  A LIL THROUGH THE PAIN…..IT IS WORTH IT TO MAKE A FASHION STATEMENT…LOL
3.0,"I really like the shirt except being very long and very roomy. I should have gone two sizes smaller. This shirt is soft and I like the color and how well it is made. I am 5'2&#34; and a smaller size would still be too long. Again , it is a nice shirt, just not right for me."
3.0,"I've never tried a pair of sunglasses in anything but dark brown or back. These clear/silver ones are stunning! They are so classy and pretty. I wasn't sure how they would be out in the sun with the fact that the lenses are clear. They are excellent. I'm very happy! :)<br /><br />Update, and it has nothing to do with the seller. It's a lack of quality control. The first set I ordered were defective because the nose pieces were so mis-aligned that they would not lay properly and there was no way I could fix them. The second pair (replacement pair for the first pair), had a very long scratch on one of the lenses. So sad, because I really like these. I just don't know how many more times I would need to order in hopes of getting a pair that aren't defective or damaged. :("
3.0,It’s thin material. Comfortable but not made to keep you warm. Should not have bought it.
3.0,The wallet portion was the perfect size. I did not like that that the actual length of the lanyard was shorter than I expected.
3.0,"These are beautiful.  Unfortunately the first time I wore them, one of the stars fell off. So disappointment."
3.0,"Top fit well, the bottom was way too small. The quality was less than average. Cute, but I returned due to the failure in size."
3.0,My husband wears a 32x32 and is 5’11” and 165. These fit true to size but he did not like how little room there was in the crotch. Color was good and quality was good.
3.0,"I am 5'9"" 155 lbs, and got the mediums.  The fabric felt wonderful, but unfortunately the pants were about 2"" too short.  I was so disappointed, because otherwise I would have loved them.  If I had been 5""5"" they probably would have been perfect though."
3.0,Stylish!but the rabbit fell off after using a few times :'(
3.0,complaints from first hour of wear: the strap is thin. it feels sharp and scratches on the wrist.<br /><br />will update if it softens as it wears out
3.0,I wasn't impressed with the fit of the shirt
3.0,Did the job for 2 days .. fell apart beyond that
3.0,"I really wanted to like this top, maybe I needed an X-Small but small is way too big for me, the built in bra is too loose and doesn't even conform to my rib cage."
3.0,This is not as described at all or what it looks like in the picture.  I'm giving it 3 stars not for the product but for the service I received for returning the item.
3.0,Fit was good. But these lenses are not even close to the HD quality of the original Oakley lense. You can see reflection of your face on the inside which is very enjoying. The overall view is a little muddy. But for price there ok. Maybe a step up from the glasses in you local convenience store
3.0,"This leotard is well made but it runs a little small, just order the next size larger . . ."
3.0,It gets too hot
3.0,IT'S A WOMEN'S JACKET! Check the zipper.
3.0,I have a small wrist and to monitor heart rate the band must sit comfortably against the skin. When I adjust the band to the tightness I need it is a real struggle to slide it over my hand. There is not a lot of stretch to it. I am trying to figure out a way to put it on and then adjust it but not easy since you only have one hand to work with. The velcro bands were much better as you could adjust it on your arm.
3.0,Used as prop for product display.
3.0,"Runs small, in comparison to any other company that makes similar shirts. Fabric doesn't breath. If you run this under a vest you will smell."
3.0,Veins and swelling. Have not used them enough to write review
3.0,Very faded
3.0,"OK fits big, all over but in the chest and I do not have a large chest or big upper arms."
3.0,These shorts run smaller than advertised and they came without any labels or tags.
3.0,"Note: I travel with a chromecast ultra unit and it's charger. I don't carry a USB-C cord or usb block b/c my Android uses the same.<br /><br />This case is too small for anything other than the Stadia controller and a pair of ear buds. The joysticks are crushed and do ""click"" when you close the case."
3.0,"It's a really cute septum ring! I enjoy the fact that it's not too huge or flashy. It's very dainty and very nice. What I really don't like or appreciate is the fact that I've used pins, tweezers, anything that I can to remove this clicker. (I have experience with other clickers before too so this should of been easier to work with) I may have to honestly see a professional to help me remove the clicker, even though I didn't want to. It wasn't worth my money or time, to be fair. Whenever I get a piercing I always think about durability and security. (Whether i can remove it easily or not.) Before I did put this ring on my nose I made sure the clicker worked, which it honestly did. It is very durable, not reliable nor really very secure."
3.0,Order a entire cup size up I got a 38c but it was more like a 38b
3.0,Runs small. Sleeves too short. Returned
3.0,"After a couple wears, it started to tarnish."
3.0,"Cheap quality, but the price was very inexpensive."
3.0,"They fit my watch CA-53W, they seem cheaply made compared to what was on the watch before.  Not really a good value for the price, the black is not as dark or glossy but it was my grandfathers watch so I still wanted to replace the bands."
3.0,Pretty loose in the crotch area but honestly for the price I can make it work
3.0,"I purchased these once before, and this was my second time. This second order seemed to be worse quality. A few of them have already ripped, and I have only worn them a few times! I love the fit and style, but sadly, the quality is not consistent."
3.0,"What I liked was the color, the IDEA of a bamboo belt, and that it seemed sturdy.  My husband used a belt hole puncher to make a couple of holes, but after the third wear a deeply noticeable crease had formed in the belt.  In leather belts you normally don't see that happening for quite awhile.  My husband didn't have this very long, and he only wore it three times."
3.0,too big and not very comfortable. Keeps me warm though.
3.0,"I'm 5'3 and it fits as expected, but definitely not quite the look and feel I was going for. I was expecting fashionista super model deluxe and I feel like a hospital patient. However, it is a cute dress that fits as expected."
3.0,Nice quality and holds the sunglasses as expected but I wish it was adjustable as I have seen with other brands.  It takes up lots of room in my sunglass case so I cannot use these attached when I plan to store the sunglasses in a case.
3.0,The fabric is a little thin but I get use out of it when needed for extra warmth at the cool office.
3.0,I gave this 3 stars because I expected the keychain to be larger. Don't get me wrong it looks great and the detail is ok at best. My brother is a huge fan of AX7 and I couldn't pass up on buying this for him.
3.0,"I loved this print and the style. The entire outfit was way too small, and did not cover the goods. Only other thing that’s weird is the straps were placed in strange places."
3.0,"The material is kind of &#34;cheap&#34; feeling, and unless you're tall and willowy, don't get the black - it will look like a witch costume on you."
3.0,Cute and bright. Just very thin and lightweight
3.0,"Much shorter than expected and very bulky.  Have only worn once, will probably give away."
3.0,They were a little small for a size large
3.0,"These are definitely comfortable but the fit is strange, and least on me.  When I pull<br />them on naturally they have a crotch gap, but when I pull them up they are above the ankle.  I will keep them, but use them for around the house.  I originally bought them as a travel pant, but they are too loungy for that."
3.0,"Beautiful vibrant colors. Fits true to size for a dirndl, which is smaller than your typical size. The material is very thin so you would definitely need a slip/slip shorts on underneath, and hope it doesn't rain. No pocket. This looks decent enough to pass for Oktoberfest without looking like a costume"
3.0,"Edit: While the &#34;green&#34; and white suit is NOT a true green, I am editing this review purely on the customer service. They personally contacted me because I was not happy with the suit and said they could replace it or refund me the money. I had already returned it but they offered to send me a different suit that was black bottoms and a red and black polla dot top. It's a super cute bathing suit and fits well and is the actual color in the picture.<br /><br />Not GREEN. Green and teal/turquoise are very different colors. Wish it was a true green. Cute suit if it was the right color."
3.0,"Nice looking joggers. very flattering to your shape. They are warm. They have a fleece lining. However not impressed with the quality, after one wash lots of pilling back side down to thigh area. Not worth $30"
3.0,"Nice quality t-shirt, but way too large. Returned."
3.0,"The Demozu men's jacket I ordered fits a bit loose on me, especially around the sleeves, but is overall of a comfortable fit and really does stop some of the wind-chill that comes when using it outdoor in the cool mornings and evenings of fall. I have had an issue with the zipper a couple of times where it snags and has to be readjusted, but I have resolved this issue quickly and it is not a big factor in my satisfaction with this hoodie jacket. The jacket I ordered is black and is made of 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex, so I would say that it is not specially soft or stretchy, but it is tolerable and breathable. I can see this jacket being used mostly for running and outdoor activities as opposed to everyday wear. However, I do use it often around the house when I'm lounging or if I need to take a quick trip to the store. The jacket's hood comes with drawcords for a better fit and has a good amount of head coverage, and the pockets have a feature to prevent the items in them from easily falling out. I have not tested the water-resistance of the jacket or the quickdry feature, but I am so far satisfied with it's practical utility. Overall, this is a decent jacket that performs best in cool but not frigid whether. If you decide to order this jacket, take a look at the sizes and pay attention so that you can get the best fit for you."
3.0,Works fine. Is a little big for 3/4 year olds. Hard for them to keep on their heads so they can see.
3.0,It was way smaller than I thought it would be!
3.0,"I would be delighted with this robe...if I could zip it. It is a Large, my normal size (I'm a size 14, typically) and this is WAY too tight. I love the soft fabric and it's pretty - I ordered it in white. But it is ridiculously small. Robes are supposed to be roomy! Very disappointed."
3.0,tight in the waist area.
3.0,"I usually run large pretty normally across all shirts and hoodies, however in this case the hoodie runs small, I should’ve ordered an X-Large in this case. Additionally, the logo protrudes out a bit much and can be felt if you are wearing a thin T-shirt underneath. The hoodie itself is well made and feels soft, but make sure you order a size larger than usual."
3.0,"I previously posted an extremely negative review of this watch.<br />This was because the watch would not retain any of the settings I entered into it, and do the information it provided me was random and incorrect.<br />The instructions and documentation which came with the watch came on an almost illegible scrap of paper 2""x3"".<br /><br />As it turns out there is a barely noticeable piece of plastic which was included with the watch which is apparently meant to be used to cover that touchscreen in cases that the screen is too sensitive.<br />I applied it last night and the watch seems to retain its settings.<br />It was included for this purpose but was not told to the purchaser. I discovered this screening just as I was about to loss the watch and its packaging in the trash.<br />Proper documentation is necessary and needs to be included as an essential part of the merchandise so that no customer has to go through the aggravation of my last two days."
3.0,Size down. It's well made just doesn't look good on me.
3.0,"Cute shirt, alittle thin, and should have ordered an ex large. But cute."
3.0,I can't review them because before I received them I broke my knee and can't bend it.  They look great though.
3.0,"QUITE COMFORTABLE SHOE, JUST TOO WIDE"
3.0,This bag is very small. It's great for a small carry on for the plane though.
3.0,These were cute socks when my 12 year old son wore them initially but after washing and drying they shrank significantly and were difficult to put on his feet. Would not repurchase.
3.0,Material is thin and silky
3.0,"5 of the socks were damaged with holes or rips. Otherwise, the sock designs are pretty even though the socks are very thin. When you pay less than a dollar per pair, you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"I bought 2 pairs. One for my sister and one for my daughter. It's super cute, my daughter loves it and so do I. A bit disappointed in the quality. They have been wearing it for 2 weeks and its already showing a gap by the sole. Otherwise it's a great comfortable fit and a really good shoe."
3.0,"I am petite 5' 2"" and 118 lbs so I ordered a small in the white color. I also ordered a small in olive and it fit different. It was shorter and seemed wider and boxy looking. Not sure why that would be unless a different manufacturer/country makes the same shirt."
3.0,Was good enough for the price but was disappointed that they do not have backs to keep in place.
3.0,"very pretty, great color, just as the photo, runs small. order it in a larger than you normally would"
3.0,Es bonita pero no era el size correcto
3.0,"Lovely print, great cut, but as usual for all fashion items produced in China, it runs smaller than the size guide advises.  Gave it to my daughter."
3.0,This material is soft and shows every flaw or bulge. I’d size up.
3.0,"My sons are tall 5 and 6 year-olds, so I bought the size 8-10. It's just slightly big for them, so i'd say it runs small. Main problem is the zipper region. It looks like the seam at the base of the zipper was joined as an after thought, and I've had to re-sow them twice in the week that my boys have been wearing them. I bought 2 more for my twins, but this zipper issue now makes me feel that the outfits wont last very long"
3.0,"They were made very cheap. The end of the leg rolls up and the waist band does not have the right type of elastic, so it does not stay up. They are very soft and not see through. I gave this product three stars because they are good to sleep in or wear around the house for lounge wear."
3.0,"This set is nice.  I bought the light blue set.<br /><br />I just picked mine up from the post office this  morning and I've already gotten a compliment about the tote.<br /><br />The seams are all even, the pieces themselves have a smooth and even texture.<br /><br />The only reason I'm returning mine is that the clasps/zippers etc are finished with a gold paint and the quality of the clasps aren't as high as the quality of the bag.  It's just a personal preference but I prefer silver, which is what the clasp on the light blue set looks like in the picture.<br /><br />It doesn't state the color in the product description, but it might be helpful to others like me who have a particulsr preference."
3.0,Super cute but had to return because the shoe is hitting my big toe
3.0,These sunglasses just fit kinda small and tight (and i have a small head!)
3.0,"I like the variety in color but, for my lymphoedema issues, I wish they were a little tighter. However, for those w/out lymphoedema issues I can see as a good buy"
3.0,"OK I don't love shopping for --or carrying a purse--but that said this bag is definitely better than what I have found so far. Problem: bag makers all make the same bags--GIANT enormous, carry on size or tiny thing on a string &#34;cross body&#34; !! I don't like  either . SO PROS: with short strap this bag fits right under my arm which is where I want a shoulder bag to fall. SIZE: good --for me smaller is better and this bag is right at my too big to be small cutoff, but you can still stuff an amazing  amount in it. LOVE the  outside pockets. Seems well made, stitched well. Now ,CONS: Is it leather?? I don't think so. I used to sell leather goods in retail and I am not an expert, and I know leather comes in different types and grades, but I suspect this is NOT leather, even a split grain. The &#34;fabric&#34; is pebble grained and slightly oily, but not buttery soft like leather should be, though it has more give then usual pleather, fake whatever they make fake leather bags from. Absolutely NO SMELL at all, which is good, but real leather should have a pleasant fresh smell. Hmmm. Whatever, it is definitely a bag I can carry for now while I look for the bag of my dreams at a price I can afford. ( and lets' be honest NOTHING has a higher markup than womens' handbags!) SO thanks Amazon for at least offering alternatives to ridiculous prices and /or the same old junk in stores. STILL LOOKING THOUGH!"
3.0,"It is so thin. I rarely wear them. I had high hopes, but they are decent."
3.0,Rough and hardish
3.0,Had to go up two sizes in this dress due to arms and shoulders tightness. It is super cute though.
3.0,"These socks fit well, stay up, and look attractive. My son loved the colors they come in. But two months in, more than half of the socks have holes in the heels. On the one hand, my son is hard on his socks--he often wedges his foot into his already-tied shoes because he doesn't want to untie and retie. But on the other hand, he has outgrown many Carters and other socks without ever getting holes in them, so I think these need more reinforced heels."
3.0,My daughter liked the back bend pendant but thought the standing pose pendant was silly.
3.0,Zero boobie support. Might look nice on smaller breasts but personally I would need to wear a bra underneath but it is see through in the back so I may not be able to do that :/ it is cute though.
3.0,"Too small. I ordered size 43 (should fit size 11 US). They fit my sister perfectly. She is a size 9 US.  The shoes are very pretty, but you have to wear socks as the insoles are a bit rough.  Disappointed the size 43 didn't fit like the chart says.  Definitely order 1- 2 sizes larger from what you think you should be."
3.0,"I like the bag and will be keeping just wished it was a bit more sturdy. Seems like it will not last unless its not filled with a lot of heavy things as well as used for anything else other than a pocketbook. Its different a bit shiny I have the black one, but none the less a cute bag."
3.0,"I like these slippers.  They are very comfortable, but they stretch out quickly and become too loose.  If I machine wash and dry them, they shrink back to a decent fit."
3.0,The shorts seem well made. Sizing lies though.
3.0,"The metallic look does not last.  I've worn the ring for about 4 days and it's wearing off.  The color underneath is black and I've got little bits of glitter on my hand.  I thought it was &#34;metallic&#34; all the way through, not just coated on the surface.  The plus about this order is that they also sent two other rings, so I'll be wearing one of the other rings soon."
3.0,The links were very hard to remove the tool they sent not very durable. Finish is already coming off only have worn twice.
3.0,Too thin of material.  Felt cheap and flimsy
3.0,I’m vertically challenged and wish there was a petite size option. There’s about 8 inches extra.
3.0,The taupe color is definitely smokey and not traditional taupe. A bit tight around the sides of the feet. Fits cute and weren't as uncomfortable as I thought they would be after trying on. Poor quality - see picture of wear and tear after wearing/standing for 3 hours.
3.0,"I love the elephant, but it takes up the entire space on my ear. It comes with two little rubber pieces to hold the elephant in place, and those were tricky to get on. I love the jewelry, but I don't think I'll wear it long since it's so big."
3.0,"I have been wearing OluKai trainers for years and have purchased 5 pairs in the last 7 years or so.<br />The first ones, I can’t remember the name of the style, were AMAZING!  I had plantar fasciitis in one foot and the arch support in those was fantastic.  I ended up purchasing a second pair of those.<br />The second style was the Kai’i.  I still have these, and despise the wear and tear, I can still feel a huge difference in arch support from my other shoes when I put them on.<br />Third pair was the Kamiki, and this was the first time I was disappointed. Not only were they far less supportive, but also in the craftsmanship. After only a few months of wearing them and very little running due to an injury, the stitching around the toes started coming loose.<br />I just received my new ‘Eleu trainers in the mail today, and while I love the look and the fact that they are very lightweight, I am disappointed in the lack of arch support that I have found in both their previous trainers as well as their sandals."
3.0,"Really cute socks, but not warm at all. I love Stance for their designs and normally find their socks to be pretty warm as well, but these are light, trouser sock material. Still like them, just not what I expected. Color of the pattern is more of a bronze as well, but I like it!"
3.0,"It's over-sized.  If that's what you're going for, great.  Just know that going in."
3.0,"The front of the sandal scuffed the finish the first wear.  It was at a wedding, so there wasn't any really rough play or surfaces.  They were a good price but I still expect more than one wear out of any shoe.  I plan to try fabric paint to see if I can make it look nicer."
3.0,"Order based on Seller comment that 3X chest circumference is 59 inches. My order based on that. I thought it was straight ( hips would be 59 inches too). The coat is not as wide in the waist and hips, so was too small. Otherwise, I liked coat. Am returning because too small."
3.0,"Runs small, a little thinner than I would have liked.  Shrinks when washed."
3.0,"Came in matching posted images, though the thread holding the wooden tips to the edges of the fabric is not strong.<br />It also is a bit small for a 5'9&#34; woman to carry bit is quite pretty.<br />Not sturdy enough for daily use, unless you are willing to make regular repairs, but good for special occasions"
3.0,"Product is like picture however it does not seem to hang on the neckline quite like depicted. Also It is EXTREMELY heavy. I wear chuncky pieces all the time, but this is by far the heaviest. I love the photo of the necklace but the necklace it's self is just OK."
3.0,"My daughter will be 9, she will fit in a 6x - 7/8 she is petite. I seen this ran small ( which it does) I got her a 10/12 and fits her perfectly. Choose wisely."
3.0,"I don't have a huge head, but this thing barely fits over my head.  I bought it in 2020, but it celebrates a birthday many years ago.  That wasn't shown in the picture.  None the less, it fulfills the needs of my governments mandates"
3.0,Takes FOREVER to dissolve
3.0,Seem to work.
3.0,"Had to redo the neck.  Shredded neck looks very cheap, turned it under and made it a cleaner look by sewing on opposite side<br />.Perfect,"
3.0,After washing was kind of scratchy and shrank.
3.0,The bag is excellent. Material is great. I love the color. The label they plastered on the front of the bag is unneeded and should have been skipped. I plan to take a seam ripper and remove the label on the front.
3.0,"I purchased this watch on an impulse but it is growing on me. Originally I thought it was too big for my wrist but I am getting used to it. So far, it is holding up time accurately since I have started it. No complaints so far and Ii have it for about a month. I will update down the road."
3.0,"very nice size bag, but I returned because I wasnt impressed with the color."
3.0,"I like these socks. They fit well and are comfortable. I especially appreciate the ankle height. They go up enough to not slip down in to my shoes and are low enough to be discreet. Padding is good and cut and stitch seems decent. There is an L on the inside of the cuff of both socks. At first I thought they were both left foot socks. However, I believe the L denotes the size of the socks as large. That is a bit odd though because I wear a size 10 shoe and according to the manufacturer a size L is for shoe sizes 4-8. Well, they are fine for my 10's. They seem to be good socks. Wouldn't mind seeing them priced a little more competitively compared to the brand names.  Currently at ten bones a pair as a single or 3-pack. I don't consider that cheap at all."
3.0,"Love this ring,  but it is to small. I had my finger sized for this piece and it doesn't fit.<br />It's a great quality piece....exactly what I had hoped for, so I'm super bummed"
3.0,"Really like the appearance allot, however it runs super huge"
3.0,Thought it would be more like a sweat shirt it was very thin and unflattering
3.0,"To be fair, reviewing clothing is subjective. Someone may like something that another person would absolutely hate, so please take this review with a grain of salt since this is my opinion based on my own taste.<br /><br />I ordered this shirt in large size since that's what I usually get in generic shirt sizes, and it fits as expected. It is definitely on a ""slim fit"" side as stated, but it is not small it fits well. It is 70% polyester, 20% cotton, and 3% spandex. It is not wrinkle-free at all - it came wrinkled, it will need to be ironed and will get wrinkles. The quality is ok, just what you would get from your regular department store  - it's not bad, but it is not ""premium"" either.<br /><br />Now we come to style... when you look at the pictures of the shirt, the buttons look white, at least to my eye. That's what I expected. To mys surprise, the buttons are actually some bright silver color which looks really ugly to me. Again, I understand that opinions on this may vary, but I really don't think that very cheap-looking silver buttons fit this shirt at all. I think white, black, or even red buttons would go well with this design. Those silver buttons make it look really tacky. Of course, buttons can be changed and resawn, so that's always an option. For me, there are other elements of design that I am not a big fan of in person unfortunately. Overall if you like this style and colors - it's a decent shirt."
3.0,"Love the colors and it’s super soft. If you want it to fit like the picture I would size up. I have a longer torso and it wasn’t as long as advertised.<br />Honestly I would probably buy it again, just in a bigger size."
3.0,Loved the color of this dress but it was not flattering when put on. The length was a little too long & the chest didn’t fit the best. I sent it back without a problem.
3.0,"Typical tee, but disappointed that the Godzilla image isn’t as clear as it was in the picture (see side-by-side pic). I got the small for my 7-year-old grandson who weighs 60 lbs, but the shirt runs small so he won’t be able to wear it for long."
3.0,"This is cute. It is really large. I am 5’10 and it’s too long for me. I also wanted a onesie with a zipper but this had buttons. The buttons are gappy, so you have to wear a shirt and pants underneath to avoid showing skin. It is comfy though."
3.0,"I usually love dresses from this brand, but this one wasn't a winner. The buttons made it kind of fold in the middle and it clung to my lower legs. It looked shorter than it was and very cheap. Was sad to return as I did like the color."
3.0,"The shoe itself isn't a bad product, but the lights were super glitchy from day 1. The &#34;remote&#34; is a cheap piece of garbage. The lights were doing their own thing, despite using the remote and buttons, and then after a week, they just stopped working all together, no matter how much charging they did. The shoe itself has held up well though, so thats why it gets 3 stars."
3.0,Not a great fit.  They tend to slide off and not stay in place.
3.0,These pens are pretty fun.  However they really aren't that visible and guests really didn't use them for the party.  Most just figured why bother.  It you are using them on a solid surface they might show up a little more.
3.0,If u large buy medium .
3.0,"These boxers are nice, but if you work out and have muscular legs these may not fit you well. My fiance says they're too tight on the thighs and loose at the waistband, so even going up a size might not work as they may too loose. However, if you're an average size, these 30% cotton, 70% polyester boxers may work for you as the material is nice."
3.0,I loved the color of the necklace. Exactly what I was looking for but the color faded onto my clothing and neck.
3.0,"Really pretty crystals, heart fell off necklace before I could put it on. I'll glue it back in and hope it stays. 16 inch necklace. All crystals same size. Blue looks a little more turquoise in person. I'm hesitant to buy other colors that I like."
3.0,"I got this for my 10 year old daughter, though beware it is made to fit smaller wrists.  My daughter has it on the 2nd loop and it fits just right.  If her wrist gets any bigger she wont be able to wear it I'm afraid.  It wont fit on my wrist.  It looks fun, keeps time really well, and for it to last 3 months on my daughter is saying something since she is so hard on her bracelets."
3.0,It's a great idea and concept but DO NOT BUY WHITE.  It displays everything you're trying to hide.  It's unfortunate because it matches everything but if you go with another color the zipper is sturdy and seems like it will hold up well.  I bought the white for a gift and was disappointed I didn't read the reviews before picking the color.
3.0,Son prefers these over masks. The stitching started to come undone after a few washes on one but it’s still usable.
3.0,I ordered the white color and it was very see-through. I had to return it.
3.0,Very very cute. But easy to break. Don't over pack your purse like I do. I've had to sow the strap on both sides once or twice.<br />But I still like using it. It's a perfect size for what I need.
3.0,"These are ok as far as length, but they definitely aren't made for chubby toddler feet. My 2.5 year old son can barely jam his feet into them because they aren't very &#34;deep.&#34; There isn't enough room for the thickness of his feet to comfortably slide into these. I'm a little disappointed."
3.0,"Glasses work, but have a strong yellow tint and are smaller than pictured in terms of lens size"
3.0,Eh<br />It looks great feels great and handles pretty well.<br />Durability isnt the best only 2-3 weeks of occasional use and the stitching is ripping showing the second layer of the ball.  Multiple areas where this has happened.  Anyway the ball is good but not the most durable
3.0,This Apple Band fits well on the Apple Watch but the quality is ok. However it’s better than spending the high amount Apple asks for.  Overall it’s a comfy band with decent quality at affordable price.
3.0,I wanted compression but not that much. Probably needed to go up in size. Nice quality though. Sent them back for easy return.
3.0,I love the shirt .just wish it was the size its supposed to be 😕 everything else was great .shipping was on time .
3.0,Great but fall out very easily
3.0,"I need light shoes, and they are but the shape does not fit my feet.<br />M. Shir"
3.0,It wasn’t as fitted as I would have liked & the material wasn’t as quality but it will do for the price
3.0,These are beautiful but heavy and so there’s a cuff that you have to use that’s very uncomfortable. I wish they weren’t as heavy so you didn’t need the cuff
3.0,"Received wrong pair but if the pair I received are similar to the picture, the sizes is almost 2 sizes to big. Very cute pants tho."
3.0,"The “flip top” is a bit clunky. It sits on top of mitten with a strange, bulky connection. Maybe all mittens like this feel this strange.<br />They are great looking, warm and soft.<br />The one top is coming unstitched and Is beginning to dangle. It will be a quick fix was just a stitch or two but it’s annoying to have to do this when I’ve had them for such a short time. The biggest thing these glittens have going for them is how cute they are!"
3.0,"My husband wanted to buy these for me for Xmas. Based on reviews here, he orede them 1/2-1 full size larger than my usual size. I usually wear a 7-1/2 shoe, but take an 8 in a sneaker or boot. so first time around we tried an 8-1/2; it was very tight. So we exchange  for a 9; that fits well but be aware that this boot is very STIFF and comes up VERY HIGH IN THE ANKLE.  I had planned to wear these foe snowshoeing and winter hiking so that could be a good thing but right now they feel kind of wierd and i'm still trying to just walk around in my house in them to see if I can adjust to having so.ething tjis high around my ankles. Amozon was great in that they sent the 2nd pair of shoes right away, before they received the ones I returned. And since I have Prime, we did'nt have to pay any shipping charges at all."
3.0,pretty but it turned my wrist green after one wear
3.0,Color was more red than I like. Also the leather loop to hold the excess after fastening was not permanently affixed so could just slide off the belt. For these reasons i had to return it.
3.0,"My husband, who is a major Star Wars fan, was very disappointed that these were quite small."
3.0,cute & really oversized! however; the lenses are see-through.
3.0,"I like these.  The material is more like that craft foam that comes in sheets?  The real issue I had was they are assembled crooked, need to be turned like a quarter of a turn to hang correctly.  Frustrating but good value for the money"
3.0,"one of the frustrating part about shopping on Amazon is that you will specify what you want, check that the order says that it is, and then it gets there and it's the wrong size. They're super cute, we're not sending it back because when she grows into them they will be really cute."
3.0,Great glasses but they arrived with a small scratch on the lens.. It would be a waste of my time to return them.
3.0,The “army green marl” and the “charcoal grey marl” colors are amazing. My favorite color of olive style leggings yet! I wouldn’t usually even consider a gray pair of leggings (because I’ve seen them on other women and just feel like they’re a bit too revealing for me) but the charcoal gray style has so much heather/marl pattern I thought they were perfect— stylish and modest coverage!<br />I’m in between L/XL sizes and I ordered an XL and thought it fit well. They felt like the right size and were very comfortable.<br />The fit of the leggings is where the love ends for me though. I’m in the process of losing weight and I have a proportional figure but I need compression to feel comfortable. These leggings didn’t have even compression throughout the fabric so they looked awful on me. The waistband is thick and nice compression but where the leg material transitions at the hip it’s not as compressed. So it compressed my midsection and made my hips look a lot fuller than they are in reality (like rubber bands around the middle of a watermelon).<br />The % of nylon in these leggings gave me an embarrassing camel toe. They need more spandex in the material so the material doesn’t sit in the creases of the groin.<br />I’m super bummed these didn’t work out. I did return them but I would purchase again from this vendor if they update the products. Even my husband loved the look of them in the package but they just didn’t work for my in-progress body. They look great on already very fit women!
3.0,"Not a great look for my shape...I am a 30H on top ordered a medium fit fine just made me look like I was starting to show a pregnancy since the top pulled up into an empire waist and the pleats then sat at an awkward location on my torso...I’m sure it’s cute if you have a small / normal chest size and it felt wonderful on, it just wasn’t the fit for me 😟"
3.0,"Ordered a larger size, sizing chart does not seem right especially in the bust area."
3.0,"Be careful, they shatter easily. I really liked them better this way so I wear them often."
3.0,Took over 20 minutes to force Jean material to feed thru because it is not wide enough. After I finally got it to feed through it held up well
3.0,"The pattern is cute, but the fit is odd, kind of weirdly shaped, but is perfect with a longer shirt."
3.0,the hats were a little small for my head..not one size fit all
3.0,"Nice look, but the backside looked like I had a horsetail trying to escape.  Had to return it."
3.0,"these fit like any normal pair of socks, however they are very thin and I quickly wore holes in several pairs"
3.0,"Love the material, runs small"
3.0,I like it but it looks cheap. _😐. Bull I'll work with it. Color is cool. Material is blah
3.0,"I really like this brand, I bought it at Costco. I’ve tried to find them at local stores to no avail. The ones I ordered were too fansy"
3.0,"I previously purchased a five pack of these reading glasses - the half rim cat eye style frame - in my prescription strength.  I love them, and I will probably reorder the same when the time comes to replace them.<br /><br />I needed a pair of non-prescription computer glasses because I work at my PC quite a bit, but did not need the 'script strength, just the amber tint.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I received was rectangular tortoise frames, albeit with the amber non prescription lenses.  I didn't return them, as I was sorely in need of such a pair, but did not receive the item which was ordered."
3.0,I love the look of these glasses. They seem more durable than previous ones that I have purchased. My biggest complaint is that they’re super tight and are uncomfortable after a while. Sometimes give me a headache. But they do their job. Just have to keep taking them off to alleviate the pressure/pain.
3.0,I like the socks but one pair already has a hole
3.0,Way too small for description
3.0,"I like this product a lot however am reducing the stars from 5 to 3 because these are see through. I know other reviews say they are not but I have experienced otherwise (it isn't when you are just standing there but when you bend over you can see EVERYTHING). Trust me, this was one of the first things I was checking on. If this material was a little bit thicker (so it wasn't see through) it would have gotten all 5 stars for me. These are SUPER soft and EXTREMELY comfortable so it stinks they are see through ( I will probably just wear this around my apartment).<br /><br />It is also important to note that I received this product a free or discounted rate for my fair, unbiased, and honest review."
3.0,"These are perfect for clinical/hospital setting as wearing a mask most fog up. These on the other hand repeatedly fall off my face, so no real protection."
3.0,"Bought this in June of 2017, and the band split down the middle where the holes in August 2018.  It worked pretty well until it failed, I just think it's not rugged enough for long term use."
3.0,"This sport bra is pretty and the design of the back is great. However, it has no support whatsoever. I am a 38/40 D and need support. It also barely has any lining either. Thin lining and no support are no good for gals with large busts. I will be promptly returning for a refund."
3.0,doesn't actually fit on my shoulder and i'm short.  the straps could be a lot longer. Small form laptop fits in the bag but not much else.  on the bright side the littlest kitten likes it and snuggled up on it. :)
3.0,Nice skirt. But I need a bigger size and this skirt is very short. Will need to wear thighs/leggings underneath this skirt. And I HATE the return options. They need more options to choose from. For those who's unable to drop off a return package. Smh...
3.0,"Loved the look of these, wish they came in a medium width. When they say narrow they mean it, my medium width toes hung off the side. Sad because they are so cute and the ankle and cross foot elastic was comfortable."
3.0,"Pretty, fits really well, cotton material but too thin, should have provided a line inside for bottom, almost see through"
3.0,"It’s a very cute dress, but runs too small and it doesn’t have any stretch to it. My daughter is a size 8 and it didn’t fit her past her chest. Would need to size up a size or two."
3.0,"If the fits were somewhat better I would have been happy, material and quality is on the point."
3.0,Not very sturdy. Handle not very strong.
3.0,True to size. But the top offers no support. I’d have to wear a bra with it which makes it useless to me. Only keeping for the shorts
3.0,The butt coverage is much smaller than it looks in the picture. LOVE the print but won't be keeping it.
3.0,Good fit but a foot too long
3.0,"I love them, they are super cute.  The flower on the side is made out of yarn, and my baby pretty much destroyed it once she got ahold of it.  I would have to say, these baby shoes are not at all baby proof. The shoe itself is nice, and the Velcro in the side is a good design."
3.0,"Very cool, but it fades very fast."
3.0,"Nice design, straps are not adjustable, a little too big."
3.0,"Pants had a hole in the inner-leg seam. Otherwise, very decent for the price paid (around $10)."
3.0,"Band not as dark as shown in pictures. If you're insistent on black, this is not for you. More like a really dark grey/brown."
3.0,The shirt is huge. It didn't work for me.
3.0,"The dress fits well- flattering and a great length.  I didn't notice in the pictures that there's a small pocket on the chest,  but it's cute and blends in.<br />CONS- The material has faded a lot after only 3 washes, so much that I won't be wearing it to any events or work in the future."
3.0,Lost tightness fast
3.0,"The product was beautiful, but the fit was not good, it was too small.  Since it did not fit me, I thought I would give it to my granddaughter however, it was too small for her.  It would have needed a couple more beads.  Was disappointed."
3.0,The description says hidden front zipper but the top is a pullover. The neck is really wide and I have to hide the trim with my beard and hair.
3.0,"The brim is super short on this hat. Every time I wore it I felt awkward in it. It felt like I was wearing a child's hat. Aside from that, it's great quality."
3.0,I like the size and look of the watch. However it flips over to 24 hour time for no reason and i have to reset it. Very unhandy.
3.0,XXXX in this brand is the same size as L in US sizes
3.0,It is very cute but the glasses block most of the hands of the watch so it is very difficult to tell the time.
3.0,They are a bit smaller than expected.  Not great but not awful.  Decent for the price
3.0,"Bought this set and a 20X for comparison and the 20X actually magnifies better than these 30X. These do provide some magnification, but it's not very good. For the low price, I guess it's to be expected."
3.0,The quality for the price is good. Not see through so that’s a pulse. But the straps are not the same length so I had to fix them. Not cool
3.0,"Product is super good quality,  but runs verrrry small.  I ordered my wife a L/XL just because I anticipated it running a bit small,  and it ended up fitting my 10 year old daughter!  Great quality, super soft and comfy,  just very small fit"
3.0,It is a bit larger then pictured. Other then that it is a good wallet
3.0,"I like them a lot, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them--so aesthetically they're great--but the polarization on the lenses seems cheap and they get dirty/smudgy easily. I'm worried the coating will scratch and rub off even though I keep them in their box whenever I'm not wearing them."
3.0,"I was excited to receive this product but unfortunately it runs extremely small in my opinion. The top was fine, no issue with it except its made out of cheap material so it prob wont last long especially if washed in washing machine. The print was nice... The bottom was way to small. I have wide hips which is why I tried to play it safe and order a size up but still too small."
3.0,"Cute and comfy,  will use as a bathing suit cover"
3.0,"Interesting stretchy material. Not breathable, soft, or very comfortable. Arrives in plastic bag, very wrinkled. I do not know whether it will hang out or can be ironed."
3.0,"Purchased these when they showed up on my search for ""Winter Motorcycle Gloves"".  I've been riding with these gloves for about a year on the colder days.  When the temp is below 40°F you can feel the cold on your hands after a few miles (I have an 11 mile commute.)  I got pain in my knuckles for 5 weeks after riding for 1.5 hours on a cloudy, breezy day that was between 40°F-50°F.  Guess I need to shop for some heated gloves."
3.0,These slippers are soft and supportive but at the 4 month mark the lining broke down sunk down into the rubber sole. Not so comfortable now. I wish they were more durable.
3.0,It’s not really that great to work out in and looks strange on my torso.
3.0,"Only used them on a quick car trip but I liked them.  It’s much easier to keep the suitcase organized, and SO much easier to get it repacked in the hotel.  I’d rather get another cube instead of the shoe bag and laundry bag - the shoe bag is just a flat zippered bag and normally I just pack a plastic grocery bag or two for laundry - but the shoe bag was good to pack snacks for the drive.  The small bag easily fit the “delicates” and a bigger bag was plenty for the clothes for a two-night trip.  I just got home and tell that unpacking will be a lot simpler.  How about replacing the laundry and shoe bags with a waterproof one for swimwear, towels etc.?  I’d buy one of those sets in a heartbeat."
3.0,Not very flattering and the sizing is off.
3.0,It was soft and comfy!
3.0,"First off, these glasses were packaged exceptionally well. Mummified-in-bubble-wrap-and-in-two-packages-and-a-little-sack well, so points for that. They feel sturdy, fit nicely and do a surprisingly decent job of blocking out the sun.<br /><br />HOWEVER. The glasses I received were NOT the same ones in the picture. They're similar, but the top black bit is much thicker on mine, and the frames are almost entirely round. I'm relieved that they're not horribly off the mark but I'm a little peeved, as I bought these to replace a favorite pair that I'd recently lost and the ones in the picture are a dead ringer for that pair."
3.0,these glasses are ok for the price but the lenses pop out a lot.
3.0,"Con: front is huge and looks silly. but (of course) the picture is too small at a 4g to really even be able to tell what it is, which I fully expected.<br />Pro: The stem(?) (back part) is long so it is the *perfect* size for using PTFE tape on. The price is low enough to only using them for taping and not care when you move on from them.<br /><br />Conclusion: These are only really good if you are using the taping method to reach a bigger size. The"
3.0,"These are not fine jewelry, but for the price they are adequate.  I wear them to work and out and about.  They have held up well and still look good."
3.0,This suit is super cute! Love the green leaf pattern.  I accidentally bought a medium but needed the small. I wear a size 5 usually.  I would have just return for a smaller size but the bottoms of this suit are completely see through! I could see through them in my dark bathroom. I can't imagine how sheer they look wet and in the sun!  Maybe I just got a defected one?  I didn't see other people saying they were see through.  Maybe they didn't notice??
3.0,kinda cheap
3.0,With the filter has been inserted they are very warm when being worn.
3.0,"This is a great swim suit although the top fits perfectly , but the bottoms are 2 sizes too small. I wear a medium normally and all of the reviews said to order up one size so I ordered a large but need an xxl I believe. Sometimes even a small fits me."
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, but doesn't cover midriff. Designed for younger woman."
3.0,Fits but the spacer is missing
3.0,"I wish these were a little more loose on my thighs, like in the product image. They, instead, are fitted around my hips and thighs, but more loose from the knees down. Hoped for a more wide leg style fit. Maybe consider sizing up to achieve that look (although it may be too long if you aren't on the taller side). Material feels nice and buttery soft."
3.0,I bought 3 packs of these because I was personalizing them for a cheerleading squad. So as you could assume I was upset when the blues were different! Otherwise they were worth the money.
3.0,The handles on the luggage broke immediately upon lifting without anything in side.  The handle worked and the color red is nice. It lasted my flight but there was the inconvenience of not having handles
3.0,It is too difficult to clean them
3.0,"These are decent watch bands. VERY difficult to put on if you have the large ones. They're also slightly on the small side as well. I bought these for my husband & they BARELY fasten around his wrist & yes, I bought the large size."
3.0,Too big and slides off. I liked them at first but after a couple of days of wearing them I noticed they don't stay on my face. It's good for what they are used for (to block the sun) but if I wanted to look cool I would choose another pair.
3.0,"These are cute, but they feel like dollar store glasses, sorry!!  Maybe it's me, but the lenses seem not 100% clear.  I'm keeping them, but won't order again."
3.0,Can't beat the price. Expected a little bit of a better quality product. Too much poliester for my taste.
3.0,"The quality of the leather is excellent. The zippers are sturdy. The shorter strap is thick and comfortable. This purse is sized medium-large. A tad bigger than expected, but a keeper. *** Update: the purse lasted 11 months. The leather purse itself is still in great shape, however, the zippers are terrible. The outside zipper kept separating, and the top zippers kept getting caught by the inner cloth liner. Finally one of the top zippers got so caught by the inner lining that I  could not get it off. Manufacturer needs to change their zipper supplier."
3.0,"This shirt dress looks exactly as pictured, although it fits tight. I usually wear an XL and that's what I bought and I can't button across the bust, and the sleeves are very tight and to short.. I should've gone up a size. I'm 5'9 36DDD, so if your busty or with long arms definitely go up a size."
3.0,The fist one I ordered based off other reviews and it was way to big so I returned it and ordered a small. It is a cute skirt however the issue where the flare-out of the skirt begins (for me personally). As Im sure it fits everyone differently however it does not lay flat in the front as depicted in the pic. There is almost too much material & sides which makes the skirt look kind of awkward on.
3.0,"Pros: Decent Jean Jacket. Fits my body type well.<br /><br />Cons: One minor issue was that the buttons felt sort of loose. Also, I found was that there was a bad smell that I cannot remove despite washing product multiple times."
3.0,They look nice but are uncomfortable and leave marks. Good if you have them on for a short time
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, I loved it but when I finally was ready to wear it the zipper did not work. I am going to give it another try and get another one.... hopefully this time it goes well."
3.0,It's decent but causes sweat in warm weather
3.0,"These are so, so, so soft. I wish they had fit me. I didn't realize, however, the small is a 28-30 inch waist with this brand, which is usually a medium. At 5'3"" 110 lbs, they made me look like I'd pooed my pants. Sad."
3.0,"fits on the larger size. Im a medium and is too long and too loose on top. Colors are nice, but on the cheap side. Im returning it. It's not see through which is good!"
3.0,"I only tried them on for a few seconds, and my ears were irritated. But, they are nice and solid and nice size. Just not sure if I can wear them all day, and not sure they are truly hypoallergenic or nickel free."
3.0,"Handles had split open, very cheap looking and not real white."
3.0,Looked very sloppy and the pink and blue reminded me of an Easter Bunny.
3.0,Pretty stiff & bulky.  Will take a lot of space for trip to Israel;-(
3.0,Ive been buying from this brand on and off for two years. Personally it’s the perfect lounge around the house shorts. But the seems are wearable for months work of working out.
3.0,"Really cute and looks like the pictures, but it had a ver strong/unpleasant smell. Had to soak it in fabric freshener to remove it."
3.0,True to description but thin
3.0,"I really love the hat but it’s small for my son. He’s 17 months old. I got 6-24 months size. It’s more like 6-12 months. So i got him 2t-4t size, probably it will be 18-24 moWe’ll see if it’s for perfectly."
3.0,"I am 5 ft 2 in and the body suit did not fit my figure. The pick top did not fit my breast either. I am a 36 DDD but I would recommend this costume if you are tall, slender with smaller breast."
3.0,Came perfect but it broke shortly after.
3.0,"Pretty but as soon as we tried to fasten the loop closure around the botton it snapped, it was on a child's neck so it wasn't being stretched or manipulated more than it should of. It just broke imediantly. It was an easy fix to sew on a new piece of elastic just kinda annoying to have to."
3.0,"If the material is cotton it sure does not fell or act like it.  The material feels flimsy.  Spouse states legs do not stay in place, rise up leg."
3.0,The size was way too small. Pick a bigger size. I had to return mine
3.0,Broke in about a week but cute while it lasted
3.0,"Interior waterproofing started coming off right away. Pack came with a rain cover tho, stitching started loosing strength about 6 months in, Its about as good as you can get for 25 bucks, If you need somthing rugged go with a better bag, this is okay for a man purse, although the stitching will look ragged after some use."
3.0,These are not really &#34;No Show&#34; because a good part of them shows no mater which shoe you wear.
3.0,"After only the second washing, they are beginning to fray, and badly at that. Two sets of the leggings are smaller than the rest. They are cute, though. Just wish they held up in the wash, and that all the sizes had matched."
3.0,"The material is stiff, so perhaps it needs a few rounds in the washing machine first.  The ruffles around the neck and bust stand out too much for me.  I'm a big chested girl and don't always want to call attention to that.  I wear a size 16, am an hour glass, and stand 5' 7&#34;.  This comes to just above my knees.  It's not too low cut.  The belt is edged with black, so it really stands out against the same-color fabric of the dress.  I'll try to like it, but I don't know if I'll love it.  Perhaps I need to get an iron and press the ruffles down flat."
3.0,There's a slight whole in the item
3.0,"The touchscreen feature works well but the glove part , not so much. They are very thin and my fingers are sooooo cold wearing them in cold weather. I guess it depends on your needs - but these are not made for significant outdoor time in northeast snowy areas.  I think they would make good driving gloves. Also, customer service is very responsive. They have replied to my review and made sure I was happy, so 2 touchscreen thumbs up for that."
3.0,"The skirt was nice, the color was exactly as pictured but the size ran really small, the next size up was not available.  If the larger size had been available I would definitely have exchanged."
3.0,"Oddly shaped. I was hoping it would be a scarf I could use as an accent to my navy dress but ok not sure how to use it, it’s more like a large sleeve."
3.0,So thin and lightweight it does NOT hide anything.
3.0,"Have only tried it on and it fit fine and seems to be of acceptable quality.  I wasn't thrilled with the placement of the waistband.  I'm rather short so I don't know if it was supposed to be higher up closer to my boobs, or lower down closer to my waist but it hit in a weird place right in the middle of both.  Not enough that I'll send it back, but enough that I won't order another one."
3.0,"I’m satisfied for the price. Problem number one, there was a snag on the back by the zipper. I need the dress for that day, so I couldn’t send it back. If there was enough time I definitely would’ve. The second thing is, I’m a small boob girl. The dress keep sliding down. I was adjusting all night."
3.0,It says no battery is included but the instruction manual says the package includes a power bank. Did the seller sell the power bank separately to make more profit? Kinda ridiculous to sell this and then have to buy something extra to make it work.
3.0,"Ok, this mask is really cool to look at. With that being said it is so uncomfortable for long periods of time, the ridge of the nose is hard and puts pressure in a single spot leaving a huge dent in your face if its worn for 10 minutes. I also decided to switch out the spikes on the sides of the nose since they blocked my eyes, so i unscrewed them and replaced them with smaller spikes. The mask also gets really bad condensation inside from wearing it, and it gets wet. Smell is a little unpleasant too, it reminds me of a cheap halloween mask, and really you cant breathe in it at all. Its also heavy and the straps dont like to hold it to your face alone. Aside from the discomfort of actually wearing it, it does look cool and works best for photos, which is why i bought it. If youre looking for a mask to wear in this pandemic i wouldnt recommend it."
3.0,The item was slightly big though I read reviews that indicated to size up.  I did use the size guide as well but it was too big for me.  The fabric was of expected quality but there were strings hanging off the item upon receipt. I had to pin the garment under my arm and the cape didn't lay properly on one side of the garment.
3.0,cute in the picture but too small.  had to give to a friend.
3.0,It was a little difficult to manage
3.0,GETSOME!!! I need the nose piece also......
3.0,PLEASE READ!! No where does it say this is toddler sizes!! The shirt is cute and looks as shown BUT I ordered a XL (says YOUTH sizes) and got a 7. Very disappointed. If you are looking for your toddler this shirt is just as pictured and very stylish that’s why I still gave it 3 stars.
3.0,"I bought these a size down based on reviews, but they were too tight. The other thing I want to point out is that to me, they look cheap. In pictures they're nice, but honestly the quality was that of a cheaper leather (and yes, there is such a thing)."
3.0,"It worked in a pinch, I added a few details to make it a bit better."
3.0,I like this jacket but the hood is so huge that it's useless.  It was not what I ordered a kids form sweatshirt.  Bait and switch.
3.0,"I heard this ran small, so I bought a medium at first... but it was way too big. It fits as expected. Get the size you'd usually get (as long as you don't usually get vanity sized clothes). For the record, I'm 5'2 and weigh 113 lbs, and a small fits me best (the medium was way too big, and the skirt wouldn't stay up on it's own).<br /><br />The quality of the product is as expected. You get what you pay for (i.e. it's pretty cheap, and it looks pretty cheap). The skirt is definitely higher quality than the shirt, but I wouldn't say either of them are works of art."
3.0,"I loved the fact that I had options as to what color band I wanted to wear. However, less than a month later and the metal pieces that secure the band started to break off."
3.0,"The dress is cute and the quality is good, but it runs short for tall kids. My daughter is 5 years old and is taller than the average child. She is about 46” tall and weighs about 36 lbs. Her measurements are approx. 21”-20”-20”. The waistband is very stretchy so if she was wider in the waist, I don’t think there would be a problem with fit. However, length-wise, it is too short for me personally. This hits at the mid-thigh and, in my opinion, too short for an active child. It’s remedied with leggings. So just be aware of that if your child is on the taller side."
3.0,The hat is fine but the brim doesn't stay flat but folds. We ironed and put a little starch on it and that helped.
3.0,Love this so much. I never take it off.<br /><br />Update: had for a year and a half. Have never taken it off and do not adjust it. It broke in two. Not durable.
3.0,"Very pretty, well made, filter pocket open 2 sides which is different. Sad that it's smaller than what I thought but I like mine big."
3.0,These are smaller than in the pics but they are nice!
3.0,"Looks small in photo; I am size four, ordered small, and it could fit a 5 year old"
3.0,"Color is not as nice as pictured, lighter, not as rich looking a blue."
3.0,I ordered a L it fit perfectly on me a lil loose on the v neck had to put safety pins to make it just right other than that loved it
3.0,The glasses are good in color and appropriate in size. But the glasses doesn‘t  not work for blue light.
3.0,Got this because I have arthritis so bad in my wrist I feel better when I wear it<br />Good for the price don’t know if it works or not but it gives off good energy only negative thing I can say sometimes it pinches the hair on my arm
3.0,I would order 2-3 sizes larger than you usually wear. I bought this in a large and it was definitely a small. Also will need a slip as it is very see thin. Very pretty and worth the $10. Going to gift to a sister.
3.0,"Not very comfortable, although it is cute."
3.0,They shrinked in the first wash. Even when following washing instructions.
3.0,Very tight dress. Able to squeeze in. Unable to zip. Ordered Xl...wear US XL
3.0,I need to desperately  use them so I won't be returning.. but come on seriously? There is a fat scratch on the side of the glasses that has removed the blue color. it looks awful. glasses look great but that's just a poor job insur8ng the quality of the product.
3.0,OK looking. The color I received was a little different from the picture shown.
3.0,"I'm large chested, and this fit very tight across the chest, which didn't surprise me, but then it was too loose in the shoulders to work for me.  Also there are 4 hooks at the bottom to help get the zipper going, but the zipper hung up on those both directions."
3.0,It’s so pretty but it broke in two days I was so sad
3.0,"If you're walking and don't plan to do any bending then you should be fine. However, if you will be bending (even at the least), twisting or squating avoid these leggings as you can see through them. Granny panties or thongs, it doesn't matter.....you can see it all through these."
3.0,"This heat resistant glove is thin and helps somewhat in protecting your hand from the heat of a flatiron or curling iron, but it’s not complete protection. I’ve used another glove that is covered with silicone bumps all over; this glove does not have those. The silicone bumps make the other glove quite a bit more heat resistant. This glove, without them, doesn’t offer the same level of protection, but it’s better than having nothing on your hand and will help for quick contact with the heating element on your hair device."
3.0,"Very high waisted. Like ""mom jeans"" lol"
3.0,"No true to fit, runs small."
3.0,Nice and light.  Stylish.  However paint started to chip off after 1 day of use.
3.0,Should have gotten cotton
3.0,I read other's review before making my purchase but it still did not help. I would say that this product runs a little big
3.0,Bought the two pack one black & one blue/yellow pair. Ended up receiving a black pair & a pink pair. Unfortunately my daughter helped me open them & decided the pink ones were hers so I can’t return them for the correct colors. Meanwhile my son now has one pair of sunglasses instead of the two I purchased for him. The price is great & they seem to be fairly durable & I love that they’re polarized. Wish we had gotten some blue ones though as my son’s favorite color is blue.
3.0,Great size and perfect as crossbody or underarm bag. Will be a nice travel bag. Only giving 3 stars as material is a bit stiff and a little loud when digging inside. Also zippers are a bit sticky. Probably just needs to be worked and broken in more.
3.0,The headband part is pretty hard/rough and it's definitely meant for a childs head its it's small.
3.0,"This dress was okay didn't love it as much as the pic.  I am 5'4 190 but curvy in the hips with 36DDD so I got an extra large.  There was no flare to the dress it just seem to hang on me. It came just to the knee. This is something i would wear to do errands on weekend. Would I purchase again in another color, No!"
3.0,"Jewelry is cute, but the tam is looks faded and smells terrible! I had to soak it in Febreeze."
3.0,"My 8 year old bought this for herself and a friend and really likes it.  I would say it's decent for the price but the color doesn't really seem to change to anything other than green/blue (barely).  Either way, she's happy!"
3.0,Disappointing....my normal size and too small. Sent them back.
3.0,My daughter likes it but its very thin.  Material looks cheap and you can see through it.  Will have to wear proper under attire to keep from showing panties and bra.  Unless you just want to show it.
3.0,"Why did they put a tassel on one end? Too much trouble to return. I like it, but it needs another tassel."
3.0,the zipper gets stuck a lot and there isn’t much room for cash
3.0,Was somewhat disapointed at the very small size.  Other than that it is very nice!  Love the saying and it is so true.<br />Delivery was fast!
3.0,"They're a bit short. I ordered a large and I'm 5' 7"" and 145lbs."
3.0,"Adorable dress, but runs small."
3.0,Nice style.But it was too loose。I lose one side.
3.0,"It says seamless but it’s not. Also I have to constantly pull it back up on my face and if I look up or lean over, it falls off. Love the design, but it doesn’t stick to my face like my others do. I have to roll it up on the inside to make it kinda stay and it still falls down."
3.0,"The shoes are awesome. My daughter loves them. But now, one shoe stopped lighting up. She's not happy. It won't charge either. Help...."
3.0,Quick shipping and the shirt looks great. Ordered a large (my true size) and it will not come close to buttoning. I’d have to wear it as a jacket. Really sucks cause to fit over my breasts (38D) it would have to be at least a 2X and that might be small. Going to give it to my sister who is a size 6 vs my size 12. It should fit her greatly.
3.0,great necklace gave as a gift.
3.0,"Runs big, my 3r daughter won’t be able to fit it until next year. It’s super cute, adorable and made of a thicker material. It’s not see through as I’ve had trouble with that when buying from Amazon in the past,  so we will be keeping it. She’ll probably pair it with some k Swiss for next summers play dates at the park."
3.0,I really expected them to be charms for bracelets but they are still pretty
3.0,"I purchased this dress a few weeks ago. The dress is beautiful! I love the sleeves, the length of the skirt, and the overall cut. Unfortunately, I had to return it. The material is very cheap."
3.0,Well made but i ordered xl and did not fit.
3.0,"The dress is cute it’s short and see-through. Also, I ordered a medium first and it was a bit short, so I ordered a large but received a medium again. Returned that and ordered a large again, but received an XL. So now I’ve made 3 returns...Get the sizing right!!"
3.0,The costume is nice overall. However the head part folds inward around neck area and you can barely see inside of it when wearing it.
3.0,This is great I use this for swimming and it feel very comfortable.
3.0,"I ordered a XXXL size since many of the reviews said that the coat runs small.  I normally wear an L to XL and it was still too small.  The coat, otherwise, seemed really nice."
3.0,When my daughter flips the string keeps coming off. It is good quality material just may not be for my daughters sport. Also the piece that adjust doesn’t stay in position. Very expensive foe just 1 and photos are misleading.
3.0,I didn’t like the way the shoe came together<br />On my<br />Feet.
3.0,Disliked the thin plastic spiral. It should to be thicker.
3.0,Their service and product are wonderful. The laces were too short for the number of grommets on my shoes. They would work great on 5 sets. Not on 6 tho.
3.0,"Good looking bag! It does have a funky smell, but that went away quickly after out of the plastic. Interior lining and zipper are VERY cheap. It's difficult to zip and I don't think the lining with withstand much wear and tear. But it is nice looking and very roomy."
3.0,I haven’t worn them much but theyvare starting to fade.
3.0,Fabric is lightweight and mediocre quality compared to other terrycloth robes of a similar price.
3.0,"I'll start by saying, I am satisfied with this satin sleep shirt relative to the price.  It feels great and the color is a deep black.  However, various threads are coming undone.  The majority are from the hem near the buttons.  Like, long threads that get tangled in the wash. Also, I ordered up one size because in my experience - even when the company claims it converted the Asian sizes to American sizes - the clothes are still too small.  Well, this company is fairly accurate.  The packaging even says to ignore the size printed on the care label because it sent the correct American size.  And they certainly did.  So, ordering up a size was a mistake.  The shirt is too large.  But, I don't mind. It's a comfy sleep shirt."
3.0,The actual color isn’t nearly as bright as shown
3.0,"Cute bag, but way to expensive for the size and type of  bag. Not what I was expecting"
3.0,Fits a little smaller than normal.
3.0,"it is very different from the pictures, i dont like it"
3.0,Great color just wrong cut for a busty kinda gal
3.0,I haven't figured out how to reverse it.  I can only use the black side. Maybe I am just not too bright.
3.0,i bought these for myself (size 6) but they fit my 7 year old daughter who wears a size 2. so i gave them to her
3.0,I love this shirt.  But it shrank in the dryer and now is too short.  Was super bummed.
3.0,"I decided to give this scarf a try when I read that some people thought the scarf was warm. However, I have to agree with others that my scarf did smell like perfume and there were some obvious loose threads around the scarf.  I washed it and the smell went away. For the low price I guess I can’t complain too much it’s still a warm scarf and I like the length. I don’t mind the thickness because I don’t live in an area with snow it’s works for me in 40 degree weather."
3.0,I loved the look of the dress it was just what I wanted but I’m 5’1 it was to long I could fix that and a size 16 and by all means by the measurements xxl it should fit but it doesn’t 😞 I love it so much I will work to fit in it
3.0,leather is just about ok..nothing great.
3.0,Material not as soft as I had hoped.
3.0,"I loved this fanny pack for the first weeks, but then the adjustable strap clip broke. Now, it's more like a purse instead of a fanny pack. Wish the clamps/hardware were more durable. I had only carried the pack for a time within the 1 month period before it fell apart."
3.0,This  shirt is not true to size buy at least a size bigger the shirt is also thin.
3.0,IT WORKS BUT THEY DONT LAST AS LONG AT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD
3.0,"For some reason, the wrist strap is the zipper pull, which I didn't realize when I bought it. As a result it likes to unzip if you pick it up from the wrong angle. The wrist strap should be attatched to the actual wallet"
3.0,Was what I was looking for but cups were too small.
3.0,I love the lanyard part of this since it looks like a necklace however the retractor part broke within the first day that I used it. Ended up buying a new retractor at walmart and replacing the one that came with this.
3.0,"The actual earrings do not look like the image in ad. They are a bit more dull in color. Quality not good enough to give as a gift, nor would I wear them."
3.0,So I got the pink and blue pair for a total of $2.99. With that said they were worth the money that I paid. They don’t look expensive but they’re cute. I wouldn’t pay a whole lot of money for them though. The fringe doesn’t hang like it appears in the picture but fans out.
3.0,Nice colored costume. My daughter love it and pictures came out lovely. The fabric seems to be warm when worn and the stitching easily tears.
3.0,"This cloak looks rather cheap in daylight, but is probably fine for dim rooms or for use outside at night. It is very generously sized, so order your usual size or a size down if you don't want a lot of length and billowing fabric."
3.0,"These shoes were so great for our daughter that we actually purchased them twice. After about a month with the first pair, the Velcro on one of the shoes stopped sticking. So I bought another pair. Same thing happened a month later! These shoes are great but they unfortunately don’t last. If they corrected the Velcro issue they’d get 5 stars from me."
3.0,"The bands fit well...but the colors are much darker than the pics show. Kinda ""muddy"" looking, not bright at all! 😒"
3.0,"I was really excited about this bag but the straps are way too short.  Not as described.  I am going to try it but it barley fits on my shoulder, which is a disappointment.  Other then the straps the size is perfect, the inside has 3 separate areas. The middle zips and the outsides button.  Very light weight which I would have loved if I could get it on my shoulder."
3.0,Plenty of length in the skirt but unless you have a backside it will fit poorly in that area.
3.0,"I really liked this top. I think it is well constructed and has a very flattering cut, it is well made for such a lightweight material, the cuffs are adorable, as are the pocket details on the front, I think everything about it is super cute. Unfortunately, I feel it runs a bit small, especially across the shoulders. I know it's 100% cotton and denim, so it isn't going to have any stretch, so bear that in mind, but I typically wear a 3X and could not get my arms into the sleeves comfortable, nor could I find room in this shirt across my shoulders/upper back. It just doesn't fit the way a 3X should, in my opinion. I really feel that this top could have benefited from a bit more room in the back, and perhaps a bit of spandex for a more flattering fit, because as it is made now, I don't see how it could work for anyone unless they have very narrow shoulders, or order at least one to two sizes up. Even wearing it open and unbuttoned was not a viable option for me, it just simply did not have enough room across the shoulders, and that's disappointing.<br /><br />**I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.**"
3.0,It feels a little larger than it should be.
3.0,"These are comfortable and fit well with good range of motion. However my finger tips still get cold after an hour of use. Also, the grip web pattern is ripping off the left hand less than a month after I bought them (see photo).  I used only for shoveling and snow blowing a few times so far."
3.0,They tug and pull when being worn also have me an infection
3.0,it's a nice piece but not for the price.
3.0,Horrible sizing and cheaply made- do not buy.
3.0,Cute set but quality could be better.
3.0,Did the job for the 2 days at the water park .. but beyond that no good ... the fell apart
3.0,"I purchased an ex-large, and still too small.  I am usually a large."
3.0,"This fit a little differently than I would prefer for pajamas. The material is 95% viscose and 5% spandex, which makes the fabric stretch and adds a nice softness to it... the ribbon like bands though around the legs and neck prevent those areas from stretching. The care label says to machine wash in cold water and line dry... I washed in cold and dried in the dryer though... it didn't seem to shrink. My major issue is the shirt fits much smaller and shorter than I would prefer... and it runs smaller than most brands with the same style as these. Lastly, the price is a little more than what I would pay for this set."
3.0,They're okay. The colors matched what was advertised. The feel of the pajamas feels rather cheap. Not upset but don't plan on buying more because they don't feel that great.
3.0,An okay pattern printed on decent material. The size chart was off though. Fits far smaller than expected.
3.0,My 12 month old couldn’t fit the 12-18m over his head. It doesn’t stretch so make sure you order the next size up.
3.0,"Based on size chart I ordered an XL because even though is shapewear, I didn't want it to fit too tight that wouldn't allow me to breath. That was a mistake on my part, I think an L would have fit better.<br /><br />This bodysuit is longer than I'm used to, so it won't work for short dresses or skirts.<br />Material is nice, stretchy and soft. Not too thin or thick.<br />I would like it more if the straps were adjustable."
3.0,"This is so soft and pretty but is too thin for bigger ladies, wish it had a lining."
3.0,"This is just an okay accessory. It was fun to wear to a concert, but it kept slipping all over my head. The side swoopy chains practically draped over my eyes. The gold is a REALLY gold color as well. If this wasn't a vine pick, I would have returned it. BUT it served the purpose of giving me something different to wear, and I felt pretty unique."
3.0,Unfortunately my wife didn't like this as a Christmas gift and I've missed my return window.  I have no idea how it fits or the quality.
3.0,A little too short. But the quality is ok
3.0,Bought a set of two so I could switch the horns but had to deal with a stripped screw. Got what I wanted at the end of the day but had to jump thru a few hoops.
3.0,The color is not like the picture it is ligther
3.0,Great color and design.. but the middle pocket isnt attached to bottom of purse so everything falls under it becomes a big mess. Good size
3.0,This shirt is so small. I love crop tops but this literally just covers my boobs. I bought a large and am only 5'3 with an A cup at best. Super cute shirt just not the best quality.
3.0,"The dress is super cute and flattering. My first dress arrived with a small hole in the chest, but Amazon replaces it right away. The dress is soft. My only complaint is the elastic around the middle. It isn’t covered by any material, so you have the elastic on your skin and it’s slightly uncomfortable. The color is gorgeous,"
3.0,Just fit larger then I was expecting
3.0,"Too big for me, but nothing wrong with the earrings"
3.0,"It looks *exactly* like it does online, I bought it thinking the picture was just blurry/grainy, and I’d get a well defined image but you literally can’t even tell they’re cats unless you really look at it."
3.0,"Dress is fine for wearing around the house.  Nothing special, but good price."
3.0,"Item ran small, especially in arms.  Returned.  The style was beautiful.  Wish it was cut more in US measurement."
3.0,sleeve was torn but I was able to sew it.
3.0,The words are definitely not as small and legible as the picture shows it. You can barely read whats on the mask
3.0,"ummmm, okay. Rather cheap for what you pay for it"
3.0,"Kinda pretty, decent fit. Slides too loose quite easily and really flimsy. Eh"
3.0,I like them but after wearing them awhile I noticed they felt bigger .  the style is cute and sporty but I wish I would have ordered a half size smaller.  I will still wear them but maybe not for going out.
3.0,the underwires poked out after a few wearings. I actually had purchased 3 swimsuits by this manufacturer and had the same issue with all of them. With one of them the wire was half out during first swim. but all had wires out within a month. without the wire the suit lacks support.On the plus side the material is very good.
3.0,Product was quality my only issue was that the black of leggings wasn’t as described. It  was a pair with a black seam down the back instead of the lined tops.
3.0,wasn't the quality i was looking for in terms of space distribution. The pockets are to small to insert credit cards n other cards comfortably
3.0,"The button holes were not open, I had to cut them open myself which was tricky and pulled out some of the threading. Figured for the price I wouldn't need to finish creating the product myself.  But besides that they fit fine. Hangs loose like a dress and not as form fitting up top as I had hoped.  I like that it is high-waisted and comfy material that flows nice. The price seems high for the product quality. Picture is of closed holes and then my attempt at cutting open."
3.0,Well made but was very small. We sized up and it was still too small.
3.0,It looks nothing like the picture but they are cute though.
3.0,"I ordered too small, fits as ordered. Gave to daughter-she really likes it. Not very thick, Color is nice"
3.0,Love the style and length but the earrings are not a solid piece so they move around and make an annoying tinny clanging noise anytime you move your head.  Pretty but don't think will wear much as they will be annoying.
3.0,First of all the left slipper was a little larger than the right one.  When I walked it slipped off my heal.  I decided to wash them and found out that was a mistake. They fit better but the sole ripped inside. Oh well besides that they are comfortable and still wearable.  I could have sent them back and probably would have been sent a better fitting pair.
3.0,I really wanted to like these shorts but they run really small and are oddly cut as well.
3.0,"We are all stuck at home and my adorable pixie cut is slowly turning into a mullet. I've been trying to find a headband that I can wear either wide or narrow that won't constantly slip back and these are advertised as non-slip. I do like the lightweight material and the fact that they are easy to fold over into a narrow headband, but I do not like that these slip off my head constantly. I measured my head (21 inches around) and that is normal for a grown human, so I simply expected to not need to adjust these every twenty minutes. Every time I look up or down the headband - shoop- comes off the back of my head. If they were truly non-slip they would be perfect."
3.0,"Bought two, one for my daughter and one for myself as matching gifts. 2 days after wearing my daughters started to unravel... the cord is silk and hard to try to fix. Love mine, its holding up well but my daughters, not so much"
3.0,"These just arrived and they seem like okay quality but there's a glittery silver thread that runs through the knit in the style I bought. Hard to see in a normal picture, but in person it's very obvious. Not crazy about the glitter, probably wouldn't have bought them if I knew."
3.0,Really nice shirt but runs extremely small. I ordered 1 size up from my normal size and it fits my daughter nicely but she normally THREE sizes smaller.
3.0,"Seller shipped product in a timely manner and upon receipt, the quality of the sock appears to be quite solid.  However, I had ordered the 18-36 month size as our son is approaching 2 years old and wanted to have replacements for his 12-24 month Hanes socks available.  Upon arrival, it seemed these were the same size or slightly smaller than what we already had.  I am unsure if the next size up would have been more consistent with our needs or if these would run too big."
3.0,"Bought these several years ago.  Use waders mostly, but these hippers a couple of times per year on small streams or very low water.  After at most 10 uses the taped seam inside the neoprene foot is peeling off at the edge.  Not leaking yet but just a matter of time, so I just glued the tape back down with Aquaseal. Fingers crossed."
3.0,The shirt is really nice but the sizing is way off. My mother in law can wear it XX2 and she is a size small.
3.0,"This is a great bag if you carry very little!<br />I expected it to have a little bit more give to it space wise. The space is there, but the fabric is so stiff it won't flex. It's a nice bag, well made and has good intentions, but not a good fit if you like to carry more than your wallet and phone. The front pocket has the slips available to keep your ID and credit cards which is nice, but I prefer carrying a wallet instead, so that didn't benefit me. The back magnetic pocket is nice but it is a tight fit for anything like a phone. It's a nice bag, but just not right for me."
3.0,Great kigurumi/onesie.  My kids can't get over mummy dressed as a unicorn.  The onesie itself fits perfectly.  I washed it and there was no shrinkage or any other calamity to the outfit.  If you're going to wear it to a party or out I recommend a shirt underneath as sometimes the fabric between the buttons shifts and causes a draft or gives a sneek peak so to speak.<br /><br />Update:  After about two weeks of owning this onesie I'm still in love but now there is a small issue.  One of the seams is completely unraveling and there is now a hole forming.  So disappointed that this haven't even lasted a full month.  I'll be returning it.  :(
3.0,Cute but long and I’m 5’7
3.0,It’s definitely more like a spandex feel than it says. The bottoms fit decent but the crotch area is loose which is very odd. The top is quite tight. I am a 40DD so it hugged those super tight with an XL shift which usually isn’t the case. Colors were spot on. I was just sad the top & bottom had flaws
3.0,"These look very nice and seemed to be a great price, but the chains have all broken off and the clips snag on silk ties so I've stopped using them."
3.0,You can see the star fabric through the stripes pocket.. Otherwise it is a great fit. Not cheap
3.0,Its cute expected something more but its not bad
3.0,"I normally wear women's size L to XL, 16-18. I do not have skinny legs by any means. I ordered the same leggings in sizes S/M and L/XL because I was not sure how they would fit. They both were too big. The S/M size fit better (amazing since I never fit in that size), but was loose from mid thigh down and would gather around the knee area. I didn't check if they seemed see through because once it didn't fit right I took them off. The Halloween pattern is very cute. I would have kept the size S/M size and dealt with the gathering for the Halloween fun wearing, but not for the price of $17.99 +tax. MAYBE for like 9 bucks it would be okay for the limited use they would get. They felt smooth and silky. They were thin, but felt nice on. Still not sure if see through though."
3.0,Its ok kinda small wear w leggings or black shorts
3.0,The top material could be of better quality. Thick t shirt material but little loose compared to the much nicer lower material
3.0,"I ordered a medium but it looked and fit like a Large. So I suggest size down from your original size. Overall it’s cute, and the floral stitching is well done."
3.0,Cute but a little too big for my face.  I had to squeeze them ever slightly to make them fit.
3.0,Cute dress..can't find a bra that can't be seen through the dress vs over the shoulders though
3.0,I thought this was supposed to be a mini umbrella. Like 6 inches or under. This umbrella from handle to tip is almost a foot. To large for the area in the car I want it for. Which stinks because I waited WEEKS for it to arrive.
3.0,The fabric was decent and the length was perfect. I am 5’6”. However can not tell you any more. The dress I ordered was the wrong size. I have initiated a return.
3.0,"This dress is weird.  I like that it fits well (I’m 34-DD and normally wear a size M in regular stores, usually L in Amazon products.  I ordered an L and it fits great, I probably would’ve been fine with a M also.  Only issue is the waist ties just under the bust-line instead of at your waist, so it looks super weird.  I’m not sure if this is because I’m busty, but I’m going to return it...it just doesn’t look right and it seems like it’ll be too warm/sweaty for summer.<br /><br />The good:  cute shape, nice longer length, warmer fabric (if that’s what you’re looking for), wrinkle-resistant and stretchy fabric, lots of room if you’re busty, fits as expected.<br /><br />The bad:  bad petrochemical smell, waist is too high, cheap feeling poly fabric, pattern is cheap looking."
3.0,Is good. But I thought it was going to look more like real leather. In average is a good purse!
3.0,Way to small but nice product gave to my friend
3.0,"I remember my grandpa wearing slippers that looked like these when I was a kid.  When I saw these, I thought, ""well, if grandpa thinks they're comfortable....I ought to like them too!""  I don't think these are the same though.  They are not as shaped as the picture. The foot enclosure does not keep its shape and falls in without a foot inside it. They run extremely large. I ordered my usual size, and they are inches too long and so wide I am not sure I can keep them on my feet while moving around.  Heh - I look like I'm wearing my grandpa's slippers all right, but when I had little kid feet.<br /><br />Aside from the size being so big, they are nice. Cushy inside, and soft all over.  The subtle herringbone print looks like it is wool, but it is not.  These are not super warm, but more of a mid-warm. Probably a good thing since I'll have to wear socks under them to keep them on!"
3.0,It fit small in the bust area and was too long for the size I got
3.0,Somewhat thin and easily comes out of shape with use and card holders are a little small making it hard to get cards out when necessary.
3.0,"Socks are comfortable and are certainly cheap enough. I use one to cover my bandaged foot after surgery. But the material is much thinner than the ones you get in the hospital, and I don't believe they will hold up for very long. My guess is 2 or 3 washings will be all they can handle."
3.0,"I was disappointed in the quality of this garment. Will not give it to niece as planned, it is of poor quality.Will not purchase from this seller again."
3.0,Colores deficientes
3.0,"The gloves look different from the picture. They are much less yellow in-person. Instead, they are a yellowish-tan color. The description is correct in that these are thick and long. Personally, after getting them and trying them on I feel that they are too thick. We got these to wash dishes and need something that is flexible. These are flexible but a bit more stiff than other dishwashing gloves we’ve had in the past. They do smell when you first take them out of the package — a rubbery latex smell to them. These do their job but not my favorite for dish-washing. Seems like they would be better for industrial projects or something where you want the extra thickness."
3.0,"I have several pairs of Pajama Jeans, different styles and colors, including a pair of burgundy bootcut cords, in medium, they fit me perfect. This pair of teal bootcut cords are no way a medium, they are a small. The waist is about 1.5&#34; smaller than all of the other mediums I have. Why is this? I guess my bad for not reading the reviews, but because I already own some, I didn't think I needed to. Disappointed and returning."
3.0,The hat was a little small but still fit
3.0,was surprised to get all 5 in the mail- I thought I only ordered one- so the kids were happy
3.0,"They are cheap fuzzy socks, and that's what I expected. What I didn't expect is 3 pairs in a bag, when it's advertised as 6 pairs. So I just paid 12 dollars for 3 pairs of dollar store quality socks. Update: Amazon replaced them. They're cheap fuzzy socks, but there are 6 pairs of them now."
3.0,"Runs too small, fabric very thin and zipper very bad quality. Very cute but I regretted buying this item."
3.0,We ordered an xlarge for our teenage 220 lb son and they looked like swim shorts on him. Def size up! (Mom is keeping for kayaking lol) Material is great has pockets otherwise nice shorts.
3.0,"I purchased two boxes and to be honest I really did not care for any of the jewelry, I ended up giving most of them away and only kept two out of the six although someone else may feel differently."
3.0,Colors not as shown
3.0,"This is an attractive and sturdy umbrella with one structural flaw - it is hard to completely close. This evening, I needed an umbrella and used this product. It opens quickly and smoothly and did well against the wind. When I got to my car, I opened the door and tried of shield myself as much as possible as I closed the umbrella. Unfortunately, it is very hard after unfolding to snap the umbrella back into place. The only way I could do so was to press the bottom of the handle against my torso and strongly pull on the pulldown piece.<br /><br />This occurs every time I try to completely close the umbrella. I never make it into the car without getting more wet than I should."
3.0,"They run small, but very cute and good value for the money."
3.0,I dont understand why the bottom of the purse has the protective feet if the purse won’t stand up. It is so floppy that it is hard to find my things. The string up the front looks really cheap. I took it off. Not thrilled with the bag but I will use it for a while.
3.0,It looks good for 1st 3 days but doesn’t stay fasten.
3.0,I even ordered 2 sizes bigger than my normal size!! Wayyy too tight. I can use it as a shirt though so I didn't return it because it is cute.
3.0,"I got these to wear in fall/winter with sweaters and loafers to work.  They look casual, yet could be dressed up when paired with a solid blouse and scarf, or jewelry, or if the sweater has an intricate knit.  The material is thin and you can almost see through.  They did not fit me and appear hand made with no label to indicate maker, size, or care instructions."
3.0,A lot thinner than I thought they would be.  I haven't used them so I can't say if they will hold up.
3.0,- Way too dark ...<br />- Leaves too much space at the bottom.<br />- Fits well at top though
3.0,My 23 year old dtr loves the blue dress. I give three stars because the initial one we ordered was burgundy and it was made of a better quality fabric. This dress had a worn area at left hip but my dtr had an event so she kept it
3.0,They're cute but they hurt my ears and broke shortly after wearing them
3.0,I am a C cup and my ta tas were busting out of this baby at the buttons! Cute shirt overall but I was only able to wear once.
3.0,These shoes are nice and somewhat comfy. The quality of the shoe does not add up to the high price. Made in China with a thin rubber sole. Disappointed
3.0,Beautiful in person. I wear a size 10 and purchased a large. I couldn't pull the sleeves  above my elbows.
3.0,It’s not close to the color and fells cheap
3.0,How’s the California danger material tag. Was returned.
3.0,they are cute but very fragile make sure you know where you want to put them..they will rip apart..
3.0,More of a Fall Sweater than Coat...
3.0,They fit good but they're not flushed with my ear. They don't match my skin either but the do feel good and comfortable in my ear. If you're wearing your hair down they shouldn't be too noticeable.
3.0,Very nice and good fabric but on the third day of use the closure came out :(
3.0,I ordered the real blue color and it came in a pastel mint green light color and are sheer. Can’t see face but could see if u have your finger right behind it. These are comfier then the blue ones u see everywhere but still not soft. But could be worn all day
3.0,"I generally love Kasper stuff, but the colors on this seem somewhat muddy to me."
3.0,I liked the material and design but unfortunately I would've liked them to fit a bit tighter. I have thin calves so one size fits all didn't quite fit. I'm hoping they will shrink a bit after I wash them.
3.0,Not sure it was cut on the straight of the fabric. I have difficulty lining up the seams to press a crease in them. The fit is as expected. I haven’t had difficulty pressing Gloria Vanderbilt slacks in the past.
3.0,I thought it would be bigger based on the measurements
3.0,Picture posted is not what it actually looks like.  Only has fur trimmed edges.  Not a bad purchase for the price.
3.0,Product is made of decent material. Super cute. My only reason for rating it 3 instead of 5 is because they sent me the wrong size. So I can't really give an accurate review of something that doesn't fit me.
3.0,I ordered the navy blue and it was tight.
3.0,"Smaller than expected, but still cute"
3.0,Product is thin and looks like cheap lens.
3.0,It's a very nice shirt great quality! It's just way to small! I will be giving it to my 12 year old cousin!
3.0,"It is not exactly as pictured here, but it is okay, especially for the price. The strap is fine, the fastener hook is wider than shown and flat, so it's a little hard to fasten the first few times because the band is stiff. I have had it for 2 weeks now and it's getting easier to use but it was frustrating the first few times. Again, for the price it is okay. You get what you pay for. We'll see how durable it is."
3.0,"Too large, I will return it."
3.0,Cute but I didn’t like it on
3.0,Los protectores negros tienen varios orificios en la zona del resorte. Aún así me los quedaré porque necesito usarlos pronto y no tengo más tiempo para un reemplazo.
3.0,"The bracelet itself feels well built and the screw down pins are nice, but this will disappoint when it comes to the hollow end links.  Not because they are hollow, but because they do not match up with the SNXS79 case properly. You can see that in pic included.  Not a big deal to just use the end links from your original Seiko bracelet but you will notice that there is now a larger gap between the end link and first link of bracelet connection.  This might bother some people but i'm going to live with it<br /><br />Another problem however is the clasp.  It takes very little force to undo it.  I can picture this accidentally coming undone during the day."
3.0,"They are o.k., but just. This size is supposed to be 9-10, I am a 91/2 and this seems more like at least a10. It's a wee bit loose, especially in the heel. Occasionally slip off."
3.0,I bought these for myself and the fit was too big and too long.
3.0,"But on the small side.  I purchased the largest size for my 6-yr-old granddaughter and it was too small to wear alone, she must wear with leggings or capris."
3.0,Cute but tight
3.0,This was not true to size. I ordered one size up and it was still too small. And it was a little itchy.
3.0,I like the style but it's definitely not a XXL. I ordered it larger because I wanted to wear my hoodie underneath but it won't button :( it's like a slim fit because it's smaller towards the bottom half.
3.0,Beautiful however very thin. Highly doubt it would protect from COVID however good if you will be wearing it on top of another mask.
3.0,"Soft and comfy, but color is not as bright as pictured."
3.0,"The color was exactly as shown and it is lined. This is warm and it looks well made with nice heavy fabric. As my wife says, “if you put it on, you better be outside because it is so warm.”<br /><br />The issue which takes this down a 2 stars is the overall fit. My wife is 5’10” with a short waist and moderate bust and large hips. This sweatshirt is made straight down, with no allowance for a bust or hips. The other issue is the neck is “almost” too small. Due to the overall build it would be nice to have a larger neck for putting it on or removing it.<br /><br />My wife did get it on without too much effort but found it to be snug around the bust and very tight around her hips. If she had a longer waist, it would be too tight and short. As she says, “I don’t know where they come up with these sizes.”<br /><br />The neck and overall build made it almost impossible to get off without pulling it off her head first… still extremely difficult. (I laughed myself silly watching her remove it. She looked bedraggled when done.)<br /><br />Regardless she really likes it but has some alterations in mind."
3.0,There were 10 of these and most came in pretty good condition. A few were not sown all the way across.  They are very wide!! Like double as wide as my normal thongs in the front and in the back. If u need undies at a cheap price then these are it. I still wear them but they are nothing I would re order.
3.0,They are so adorable but they are just a bit too small.
3.0,"Cute belts, but in a &#34;one size fits all&#34;.  I'm an XSmall to small size and am going to have to add some extra notches."
3.0,"Product image does not match color received. The color of the lace is a mauve color not cream. And the color of the velvet is a darker pink not light as shown. Fit is good. The lace on the bra top is pretty flimsy, I will have to tape it down for my photoshoot."
3.0,Cute but thinner material than I was expecting. I was expecting actually pajamas that are warmer.
3.0,Mine had random threads in 2 areas. And it was a gift so I felt a little bit disappointed.
3.0,The left lens jiggles a little but overall it fits right.  I'm happy with the product .
3.0,My predicament was getting a size 11 or 12 since I size at 11.5.  I ordered 12 but my foot was swimming in them and I couldn’t keep them on (that’s how wide/large they were).  I exchanged for a smaller size and still the width was ill fitting.  The problem was with the front strap. Also it’s constructed of very thin leather meaning expect it to expand with wear.
3.0,"Unique design, but not quite as aggressive as picture shows.<br />I got the vest with buttons almost vertical and not nearly at the angle that the picture suggests (which is what I was looking for).<br />Read the sizing charts carefully. tag sizes are way off but sizing chart is right on.<br />I'm 5'10&#34; 190lb and fit was fine, maybe I should've gone with one size smaller (so tag xl instead of tag xxl).<br />The pockets are all fake. Quality seems good (other then design differences)."
3.0,"Beautiful watch, sadly it stopped working a few days after receiving it."
3.0,"Way thinner than I expected. These are tights, not really leggings. The white are basically see through."
3.0,Is bigger the I spectad
3.0,"Love the swimsuit but it is a little big in the chest area. I bought an XL bc I have a longer torso, but wear an 38B bra size. I think a large would have fit perfect."
3.0,the buckle broke on the side after wearing 3 times
3.0,1 out of three didn’t work
3.0,Es duro y de calidad ademas bonito
3.0,This necklace is stunning only problem is it started to turnish quick. Never put it with other pieces. Store it by it's self. That way it'll keep longer...
3.0,I didn't like the fitting.  It's like warm tights. Looks weird.
3.0,"The product arrived and was as described - a deep pressure sensory compression undershirt. It provided the pressure that I was hoping to achieve to help calm my son. Unfortunately, the area around the edges of the arm holes are ""bumpy"" and he can feel them under his armpits. I was surprised that it would have textured edges because the children that would wear them would typically have sensory issues. I am trying to convince him to wear it over a long sleeve shirt while we are at home to at least get some use out of it, but it ""bunches"" the fabric of his shirts because of the deep compression.  I would not recommend this for anyone who has a child that is sensitive to textures of fabrics, tags, etc."
3.0,"Great quality but runs smaller than expected, and I have a child who is very small for their age."
3.0,Chain breaks very easily.
3.0,Way smaller than I thought.  Hurt my nose.
3.0,"Why I gave a three star is there is no way to contact this seller!!! No, receipt in package that would usually have number on it!!! Yes, the items came quickly. In the past I have bought something simular to these at Micheals but of couse these are cheaper. All the containers are fine but the latch that holds the lid shut broke off before I even got it unwrapped. I did order two of these the other one does have a good crack in the lid but usable. I use these to hold glitter acylic for doing nails."
3.0,"I have a love/hate relationship with this dress. It fit me perfectly... complemented my curves, slimmed my waist, made my butt look nice, but the zipper was cheaply made and would not zip properly! After trying to get the zipper back on track and to work for about 2 hours, I gave up! :-("
3.0,"I SO wanted to like this dress. I have wanted a maxi dress for a long time.<br />I finally took the plunge. I'll be returning this dress.<br /><br />I love the fabric. It feels very nice.<br />The pockets are nice and deep, though I can't imagine that I'd actually use them.<br /><br />The bust is a little loose, and the waist isn't at a good place. It's too low for an empire waist, and too high for a normal waist.<br /><br />The length is no good. I ordered XL and this comes to my mid-ankle. I am 5'9""."
3.0,Super cute! I love the fabric as well however the chest area is super tight. I would size up one to be comfortable.
3.0,I thought it was embroidery also but its a sticker I think
3.0,Tight around the calves.  If muscular size up
3.0,I like the color but when I put them on it hurts my nose from the metal piece
3.0,Thke 2&#34; skater is almost too small and this 4&#34; skater is just a tad too long to be prefect. Where are the 3&#34; skaters????
3.0,"This is a beautiful pump - top portion is suede with covered heel, comfortable and just right heel height. However, the product description states ""New"" but it was obvious the shoes were re-soled. Not cool - returned."
3.0,"The nose piece on these glasses is rather narrow and doesn't adjust so the glasses sit high on my face. They tend to smudge very easy and unless they are very clean, the view through them is cloudy.  I realize these are not expensive glasses so they are ok for the money but not great."
3.0,They are nice decorative cases but offer no protection really
3.0,Cheap and kinda short in length...hard to hate em but hard to like 'em.
3.0,"IT'S A T-SHIRT, NOT MUCH MORE."
3.0,The Shirt itself is really cute but they fit tight..not lose fit like the description. I am usually a size 8 and medium. I purchased this tank top in a medium women's but really should have gotten a large. Please purchase 1 size up unless you want it to be very tight fitting.
3.0,Fits as expected. The front looks like a skirt but the back looks like shorts. There is a piece of fabric in the front so it could be dressed up. Had pockets in front and back. Arrived very wrinkled so I hope it presses easily.
3.0,Fabric was stretchy and clingy - not a good fit if you are looking for a t-shirt style shirt. Color was good.
3.0,The dress was thin and poorly made.
3.0,Not a lot of support but comfy enough. Very pointy so looks odd shaped
3.0,"Looks way cuter on the baby in the product image.  not for a newborn, hopefully can use when baby girl gets a bit bigger"
3.0,"Fits great, colors great, I was just slightly disappointed with the fabric. It seems a bit cheap. Also all the seems popped as I put it on."
3.0,"Product is okay.  However, unlike the picture, the sunglasses did not come with the hinge joint that allows it to snap open or close.  It came with a much more flimsy joint.  I'm disappointed by that because the last time I ordered this it had the hinge joint"
3.0,"Fit is somewhat small I'm 5.5 140 lbs 27 waist 38 hips the teg said S and I'm usually size S in leggings and those fit tight, the fabric does not have a lot of stretch to it so I would size up"
3.0,The inside is not fuzzy as depicted in the photos. Pretty disappointed in the false advertising.
3.0,I love how its shiny and sparkly
3.0,The leggings were too small for my back side. In the front they came up to my bellybutton and in the back they came up to the top of my pelvis. My undies didn't show through though and they come down to my ankles. So they mostly fit and as long as you're not wearing crop tops these are nice leggings.
3.0,"Top is definitely WAY too big, which I was expecting after reading all of the reviews. Honestly it was so cheap I was fine paying the money for just the bottoms. Bottoms are great & fit as expected, I get so many compliments, but ripped along the seam after a year (again, fine for the price)."
3.0,These are comfortable but not lightweight. They are more of a coarse polyester not a quick dry type. Luckily I bought them for hanging around the house and not running. I do like the drawstring with the plastic end vs. knotted end so the drawstring won't unravel. The pockets are handy and deep enough to use. They washed and dried well. I wish they had a few different lengths. Overall a decent product.
3.0,I ordered knowing this was not a platform shoe by looking at the pic but expected a solid shoe. The shoe was cheaply made-the bottoms were very thin and uncomfortable. May work you but didn't for me...
3.0,Nice capris but the crotch threads started coming undone after 2 wears.  They fit wonderfully but I don't think the stitching allowed for the same amount of stretch as the fabric so they popped.
3.0,I ordered for my kids and he was happy.
3.0,"By granddaughter picked this out for her Moms birthday. Would have liked it in sterling silver, but its good for what it is."
3.0,"Much shorter than in photos.  Also material is odd.  Not cotton.  Back is cool, but unless you have a really short torso, wearing it will be hard for a man."
3.0,"Chain came broken but was an easy fix reconnecting the broken link. The chrome on one of the main chains was tarnished and defected in appearance. Wouldn't notice though, unless close up. Otherwise I like the style of these and will still use them. I plan on ordering another pair to see if it was just a rare mistake. Will write another review on the quality of the second pair"
3.0,I loved the pattern and the breast cancer awareness/relay for life awareness but the socks are too tight. Was disappointed.
3.0,Dress was a little small but not too bad. I did order a size up so that helped.
3.0,"The mold was awesome, but the plastic was super cheap and cracked in 2 places upon arrival even with more than ample packaging to protect it"
3.0,This is a poorly made dress. Does not fit the way it should. Very disappointing
3.0,"I love these pair of slippers! They are warm and comfy. Just love wearing them all over the house! The only issue I have is that the yarn started falling off two weeks after I bought the pair. Otherwise, I love these!"
3.0,".The shirt I ordered was a western style shirt with snap closures and a different design. The shirt they sent was a regular style shirt with buttons. It's not a bad shirt, but it's not what I ordered. As long as you understand what you're getting, this shirt is fine."
3.0,"Cute top, but too thin and too small."
3.0,"The shape and cut of this dress is very flattering. However, the material is so thin that it shows every line and dimple. I ordered black thinking I could easily get away with wearing a shaper/spanks underneath without it showing. Sadly, the material of the dress gave it away. So I’m waiting until after the holiday season when I’m 5-10 lbs lighter to where I feel comfortable wearing it without a layer of compression/shaping garment underneath. Otherwise the material is great for SoCal fall weather (60ish degrees), it runs a little big considering I’m usually a medium. The shape works well with my curves. Sizing up would have just made it baggy for me in weird areas. I’m 5’3, 150ish lbs, with a 38” bust, 25” waist, and 38” hips and I ordered a small."
3.0,Looks nice but very small. This would not fit my husband as he has very large wrists but I don’t think any man would find this to fit.
3.0,Not the brass color you see here. They are bright gold
3.0,These are very hard rubber sandals.  Feels like walking on wood!
3.0,Love these but they tend to roll
3.0,"Almost great…except the little circular piece that is supposed to keep the key attached to the chain keeps falling out… all over the place. Not sure how I haven’t lost it yet. Otherwise, it looks really nice and makes it hard to lose your keys."
3.0,These are for adults....on thigh highs for a toddler
3.0,Cute but a bit awkward to put on as each side screws into the rainbow colored section. Also a bit longer than usual bar so catches more often.
3.0,"I bought it for $75 when the original price was $200, so I was very happy with the find. After I received it, I noticed that every now and then one of the click buttons would hit my hand, during a bend, and stop the time. Easy fix was the obvious reactivating the click. The trouble however, started when I had not noticed the seconds moving hand had stopped, throwing the date apart. I tried fixing the date but it does not revert back to the proper date and day. I even tried stopping the watching until it got to the proper date and time, but that did not work for me. When I woke up in the morning I noticed that the day and date had moved up one even while being stopped. I even tried adjusting the watch outside of the 11-5 hour ratio mark, but that didn't do anything for me. Other than this though, the leather strap feels nice and overall the watch does bring some attention for a budget/ starter watch.And the glass sapphire is a great addition to the quality because I have had it since April, and being a rugged guy in a Jeep, it does not have single scratch on it's surface."
3.0,It’s pretty big for me. I got size small. Which is the smallest size they have :/. Its goes to my ankle. So if you’re taller maybe it’ll be too short
3.0,"I really was happy with this dress until 10mins into wearing it the flower came off. : ( The glue dun came in handy for reconnecting it together. It sucks that its a one time use, but this dress was everything."
3.0,"Too small and cheap material.  But it was priced right for the quality.  You get what you pay for.<br />3 stars for the seller because they delivered nicely, quickly and the return was easy."
3.0,The quality was lacking.
3.0,"I loved the dress, everything about it was great EXCEPT it was a dark turquoise blue color, but it in the picture it looks more turquoise green, which is what I needed.  I definitely buy this dress if the color was right!!"
3.0,"The gradient tint was a bit blurry, seems like the &#34;darkener&#34; was applied to thickly."
3.0,"I found that this dress, while the color and style were nice, was not a true to fit size.  It was too tight in the sleeve, and the waist, which made it difficult to put on properly, and a bit difficult to remove."
3.0,"The pendant is absolutely beautiful, but the chain came tangled. It took me 45 min to untangle it. Other than that it’s beautiful"
3.0,Looks and feels kinda cheap. Haven't tried wearing it yet.
3.0,It met all my expectations except it wouldn't stay up on the side w no shoulder strap.
3.0,"These are cute tights. After reading the reviews, I ordered a size small and I'm 5'6&#34; / 110 lbs. These seem very short in the legs to me because I had to work to stretch the leg length to get the crotch all the way up to where it's supposed to be and the waistband hit me well past my belly button. They just aren't very comfortable to me. I may order another pair and try the medium."
3.0,The screw came out within a month of average use.  Love how they look though!
3.0,"Just ok. A little bit small, but definitly not as expected"
3.0,Way bigger than I expected it’s ok
3.0,"The color looks slightly more vibrant in the photo. When I received the purse, it looked a little dull-colored, and the vinyl was stiff. There were a few creases in the vinyl that did not look like they would come out; I tried packing it tightly with paper and keeping it in a warm room, but the creases remained. It's not a bad item, really, just not what I expected, so I returned it."
3.0,Bottoms are to small. Top fits fine.
3.0,"I have some Columbia shirts and jackets and I like them, but this one didn’t fit well on me. There are a lot of extra space on the back and the waist, which makes me look FAT and uncomfortable. I had to return it."
3.0,cute but not well made. coming apart at the seams after 1 wear.
3.0,I was not generally impressed with the product it was small though it did said many and it just didn't seem like it could fit not only that it only had four pockets and I had to install a piece from previous wall that I am as well I guess it would work it seems like the the keychain piece is very good however the rest of it is a meh at best
3.0,"Nice quality shirt just fits a little loose on me than I expected, had to get it altered to fit my top & neck better"
3.0,"I actually returned this item because the overall comfort wasn't there. The shoes felt so stiff they were almost hard to the touch. They rubbed the tops of my feet and between my toes. That said, they are really cute in appearance!"
3.0,"Bought this for my fiance. He likes to wear his jewelry 24/7, so he kept it on in the shower. The lacquer is not waterproof and began coming off, so he had to remove the cuff every morning and put it back on after his shower. The strain began to show on the metal. I told him to put it away while I considered taking it to a jeweler in town and having a more sturdy, sterling version made."
3.0,The shape and size are both fine. The lace is scratchy. I have washed the camisole five times and it is getting better.
3.0,the print was as pictured but the item was too big
3.0,"This band was great, although difficult to get into the slots. However after only a month of use it is very worn and damaged."
3.0,This dress is adorable! However the sleeves are a bit small...and it’s incredibly short! I’m 5”5 and it barely covers my booty. That’s a no go for breezy summer days. If it was just a tad bit longer it would be perfect!
3.0,Bought these for our cruise two of the four were missing the locking piece to make the tag stay on the luggage. We ended up losing one on the flight home. Super disappointing.
3.0,execelnte product
3.0,Not elastic so could not wrap around my wrist
3.0,This item I did wear and because of it being the Summer I guess I lost some lbs so it did fit
3.0,It's a nice bra but was too big for me. I normally wear 36C but 36B would have been a better fit. Quality matches the price
3.0,"but if you order these with the expectation that they will pass for real diamonds, you will be disappointed.  They look like what they are, costume jewelry.  I rated them 3 stars because the prongs are not lined up perfectly and one is bent so I am going to return them.  If they weren't defective, I would probably keep them because they fit nicely (ordered them a size smaller than normal) and they seem comfortable."
3.0,"Great shoes... EXCEPT... if you haven't had suede shoes before, these things are a devil to clean.  And show EVERYTHING you might get on them.  But, I guess I should have known that.  Fit as they should and are very comfortable."
3.0,the head band broke as soon as we put it on
3.0,"Love this style! Gave it a 3 star rating because although it’s nice and comfortable also it’s chiffon, which i love because it’s lightweight and flowy... But it is a wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen. Underneath each frilly flap is completely see through, the second to last flap falls right over my butt area and with a wind gust, or jumping up and down dancing (i wanted to wear this to a wedding) i could easily expose myself. Yes you could wear a slip, or body con dress under it, that just defeats the purpose for me, i don’t like layering and skin tight which is why i went for this in the first place."
3.0,Nice but runs small and this material.
3.0,First ima start by saying it took me bout 30 mins to put it in! The L shape bar is so short and the hook part was tightly closed had to use pliers to open it some! However I love the look 😍 Gave it 3 star because the amount of work I had to do just to get it in which was not easy at all!
3.0,As a size 5(usa) this is actually pretty tight on me. And the eyes on the butt aren't symmetrical. However the material is comfortable and shiny! And unlike other yoga pants types it doesn't come up past my belly button which i love! Its more of a low-rise.
3.0,The color is not as bright as shown in the pictures
3.0,"Super super cute, loved it. Had to adjust the rose a bit and the color fades after a few showers but overall a good belly button ring:)"
3.0,it looks like the picture. i did not expect it to turn a copper color so quickly. it is cute but i wont buy it again
3.0,I'd recommend buying one size smaller than you think you need. It's okay but I like my Tilley hat better.
3.0,"They are very nice looking boot, but unfortunately they were way too small, they opening of the boot was so small I couldn't even get my foot through, and I odeed a size up."
3.0,It has a very strong chemical scent. I got this bc I wanted a turtle neck or tube scarf that didn't require wrapping around my neck. In order for this scarf to cover my neck I have to wrap it once.  May return this item if I find what I need.
3.0,These boots prove beauty is pain. They look amazing; I wish they were more comfortable
3.0,"Here's the thing: Dr. Seuss wrote over 60 books. So why did the 6 selected works for little boys underwear included ""Thing 1 and Thing 2"" and ""Oh, the Places You'll Go""?? But maybe it could be worse. Thankfully these titles were excluded: Yertle the Turtle, The Shape of Me and Other Stuff, There's a Wocket in my Pocket, Gerald McBoing Boing."
3.0,Would be better if it had better polish. Looks dincky and easy to lose. Would only get if someone likes the moon and doesn’t have a necklace of one.
3.0,Height is great but too large.
3.0,"Didn't like the color. It looked yellow, like an old look but my boss like it, he thought it was funmy."
3.0,"My niece LOVED these!! So cute! She wore them around the house even. These did not survive our beach trip. Day 3 these were done. If the sole was more durable, I'd probably buy her more to just wear every day. She loved them that much. If you only need a couple days out of these shoes then they are the ones for you!"
3.0,No stretch. Very uncomfortable but very flattering
3.0,Started using them today
3.0,Used for police uniform. One broke about a month into use. Not bad for the price overall though.
3.0,Cute but not very stretchy material.. not as long as it appears on photo
3.0,Not big enough for me
3.0,A lot less quality than i expected.
3.0,They look nice and fit fine but the seam start coming apart can be sown with better quality stitch!!!
3.0,Looks cheap. I had to return it
3.0,The suit is really cute but the fit is way off.  I'm a small lady and ordered a medium based on the reviews I read.  The medium was still too small. ugh I hesitate to order the large because it will probably be too large in some areas. Too bad!
3.0,"I want to give it 5-stars because I really like the wristlet itself, but the rose scented sachet included in the wristlet is so bad! Every time I open it, that's all I can smell. I hope the smell goes away with time. Blech!"
3.0,"Very nice but 4 stars because band around leg is thick, rolls up and see thru clothes"
3.0,Just did not fit me right. I liked the blouse.
3.0,This product needs some instructions to help with using it. The metal is very thin and bendable.
3.0,"I thought it was bigger, I gave it to my daughter, I should read before buying"
3.0,"material is a little rough, and it is a little long. Tucking in shirt is a must with jeans, the lines on the shirt were a little wider than shown. Overall a good shirt but now worth what I paid."
3.0,These are a little weird because the front and back are exactly the same.  There is no room for a butt.  They fall down a lot because of that.
3.0,"Runs smaller and skimpier than expected — good thing I bought a cardigan to go over it, otherwise it would not have been wearable. Arrived quickly. Gorgeous color."
3.0,Does not fit a snug as the one piece suits. Stretches out as you swim
3.0,"I needed shapewear under a bodysuit but the shapewear keeps sliding down. It would’ve had four stars if it stayed in place because it does a good job of keeping everything in, but that con makes it difficult to wear."
3.0,"This is a nice hat that securely stays on, my only issue is that the brim all around is a little flimsy and would bend/fall in front covering my daughters eyes causing us to put an upward curve in the front to keep it up, but making it look unattractive."
3.0,"When I first opened these and tried them on, I was pleased with the fit and feel, although I noted that the material did feel thinner than the two pairs of shorts I have already ordered of this type, both from different brands. I noticed immediately that the honeycombs are larger than on my shorts, but wasn't really bothered by it. After a few hours of wear, just hanging around the house, not exercising or doing extensive housework, it occurred to me that I was having to yank these back up every time I stood up and every few minutes if walking around because the crotch was sagging, and multiple times bending or sitting down I heard and felt something that made me check to make sure the seams hadn't ripped in the butt/groin area, even though I feel like these are not quite snug enough. It could be the material being thinner than I'm used to, but the elastic waistband is only half as wide as the ones on my shorts, which are way more slimming. While these may be more comfortable for others, I will be returning them and sticking with SEASUM and Ronyme brands in the future."
3.0,Gave it a # star even thou I have to return this item!  Read the sizes guide before ordering and there shouldn't have been a problem!  In Actuality this item might fit an A cup just fine!  Not enough of it for a B cup Let alone a C that I ordered!  Item looks well made but deffinatly not sized correctly!
3.0,Was not impressed very cheap
3.0,Sent back didn't like the fit it was a little bit small
3.0,"It’s cute and the material is nice. Color is lasting. However the butt area was not made well or wide enough,  Always popping out the sides! Not what you want in a kids bathing suit. Would not buy again."
3.0,Cute but too big for my infants head
3.0,"The shirt looks different than on the picture, button hols are larger than buttons, can't wear it anywhere"
3.0,"Very cute, but overpriced for what you get and the quality. Broke when I was trying on and doesn't cover much. Defiantly more of an accessory than a skirt."
3.0,"Not a 90 degree bend, slides in nose easily but can't get quite as comfortable as the traditional l shaped."
3.0,It is not fitting
3.0,"The watch itself is GORGEOUS. That said, my husband broke it within 2 months. He wants another one so bad, though, because of how lovely it is. I might consider getting another one if he promises to be a little more careful."
3.0,"Was not really impressed.  The mask is rather tight and uncomfortable.  I do not have a large head either.  Maybe it will stretch with time.  I don't know.  But, like shoes, you want a fit that feels right immediately."
3.0,"I thout it was a sweater. I kind of expected a ""poncho"" like sweater, but it's like thermal material so it lays different than expected."
3.0,"The dress itself was adorable. The fabric was somewhat cheap, but overall fine. The main problem was that it was made for someone with ginormous watermelons for boobs, so it was way too big in the chest area. I'm not sure if a person exists that it would fit. Maybe Dolly Parton or something."
3.0,The top fits snugly and kind of weird. It is very narrow. I kept having to pull it apart at the top while wearing it. One of the criss cross straps was also not sewn down on one end. Material is not soft. Would not buy again.
3.0,"These jeans were okay. I will actually be returning them though.<br /><br />Pros: The jeans were similar in style, and overall quality wasn’t bad.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The knee holes were HUGE and they ended up being baggy when my leg was straight making the jeans overall look weird on me.<br />- The pockets were made of a weird material I feel like. It was very stiff. This isn’t a bad con, just a con in general.<br />- These jeans were not what was pictured. Again, they were similar in nature, but the wash was different, the way the holes were done was different, and the ripped parts were also different.<br /><br />Overall, these jeans aren’t bad if you got them. They just didn’t fall well on me and I don’t like seeing a picture of what I am buying and getting something different."
3.0,"Worthless for the application I needed it for and wouldn't stay in place. I was better off making my own out of material from hobby lobby. It wouldn't carry much weight if you tried. Maybe an ID, cash, Cards and a lip balm. Much else. It was beautiful and and well made"
3.0,"had to size up for my 7 year old as it runs small.  Also I was disappointed in the length, was much shorter than I expected, had to return for that reason.  Otherwise it was beautiful colors and great fabric, I love Truly Me dresses for my daughter."
3.0,Fabric was so thin it’s only good under<br />Clothes not good to wear alone
3.0,I returned these. They were huge. I realize the description of 3/4&#34; was accurate but I guess I didn't realize just how large that would be compared to my ear lobes. The color was spot on and they were super cute for a nautical touch but they just looked ridiculous on me.
3.0,Good beach shorts dries easily
3.0,"The dress fit as expected, but I am 6'0&#34; and it was a couple inches too short. The other thing I didn't like was it fit snug in the body but then the sides flared out at the legs and looked a bit odd. I forgot to take a photo before I returned it."
3.0,Lindo aunque es muy brillante :)
3.0,"Ordered two pairs of these and am disappointed that they are too small! The material seems great but I can't fairly say since I can't wear em. I ordered XL because I like a loose fit, so I can generally fit into large, but these are more like a medium, unless you like to wear em pretty tight. I mean, I could get em up, but they were just too tight for my comfort!"
3.0,Cute sandals but not worth the money!
3.0,"So this band looks wonderful. However, you should be warned that the pins that hold the band on the watch are not attached to the band. The pins come with the band and you have to insert them into the band when you take it out of the package. When I took the band off my watch one of the pins slipped out because they are not permanently a part of the band. The pin fell on the floor and was very difficult to find."
3.0,"there is no seam , no border on the outside. So the bottom slips from under the bottom up the side of the foot"
3.0,I ordered one few days ago . Very beautiful jewelry I barely wore it for few minutes and some of gems go missing. I really liked it so I ordered replacement. Second set come with same problem before I wear it .missing gems. They should send this jewelry with glue so you can repair it
3.0,"I’m about 5’11” and bought this after a couple other positive reviews from taller women, but this fit me more like a maternity top than a dress.<br />Apart from that, the fabric is very thin (thinner than typical jersey cotton) and there was a huge hole in the left pocket.<br />So, yeah. If you’re on the shorter side and feel like fixing a few open stitches AND you feel that the price point warrants it, go for it."
3.0,i really liked it great quality i have bigger boobs tho so it slid off them alot.  comes with free gift i got some tights that didnt go with the outfit which sucked but still nice
3.0,"Nothing real special, and it took a long time to get it."
3.0,"Body of dress fits nicely but top too lose. I’m 5’0 and 105 lbs, and couldn’t keep the top up with a size small."
3.0,"I wore this church for Christmas services. I received a lot of compliments on it. Would I buy it? Yes. But I almost would rather spend $10 more on something a better made. There's little things that are annoying. The lace top has no give in it and I wish it was more form fitting on top but with a stretchy material. I feel like as is, it makes me look heavier because the transition from the top to bottom fabric is slightly loose. Also the second layer of fabric underneath as said in other reviews, is sewn inside out with a white tag seen through the material, so I cut most of tag off.  The edges on the hem seem rough. I opted to wear this with a long jacket to make it work and may consider taking it to a seamstress to see if she can improve it. Overall, I like it and still will wear it, but given the chance, I'd rather spend a bit more to get a better made piece and will probably not get anything from this brand again for that reason."
3.0,"Ordered a size large, but it was too small and tight.  I am 5’6” and weigh 150 pounds.  I will donate this dress and I reordered it in XL.  This one fits fine."
3.0,As soon as i put the dress on the strap popped. ☹ I did not have time to send it back and have it replaced so i had to take it to get the strap fixed and I had the seamstress go ahead and reinforce the other straps. I will pick it up today and wear it this weekend so pics to follow.
3.0,"I ordered the silver frame Whiskers with polarized, black iridium lenses, sold by Altrec and fulfilled by Amazon. The label on the box matched what I ordered, but the actual lenses have a warm tint, definitely not the black iridium polarized lenses as described (I have two other Oakleys with black iridium polarized lenses, and those have no color tint).. They are polarized though. My best guess is they are maybe a bronze polarized or something. The accompanying photo is pretty accurate of the color tint, although the lenses are darker than the photo suggests. The silver frame looks just like silver paint... it's not a sexy looking chrome frame or anything.<br /><br />Overall, for half price I'm satisfied. They are comfortable, light and have high optical quality."
3.0,"the waist is about 1 1/2 inches to low for my liking. Definite plumbers crack upon bending over.  HOWEVER, if your skinny as a string bean with no ass they might be excellent for you."
3.0,"The main material on these packing cubes looks thin and of questionable quality. The front mesh however, does appear to be a nice thick quality fabric. Too bad the entire bag isn’t made of that mesh. The zippers are lightweight and easy to open. The interior seams are covered with the material they make reusable grocery bags out of and they are not sewn on too well. Overall, I’m not impressed but they are okay."
3.0,The type of metal tarnishs real fast other then that no complaints
3.0,"I wanted th bag because they show an iPad in the picture, and it would have worked for what I was looking for. However, the picture isn't true and iPad does not fit in there. A little on the small size which was not shown correctly in the pictures. Pictures are deceiving. Overall though a decent shoulder bag."
3.0,"I bought a size L because I already read that it fits small, I'm an M but it is too tight."
3.0,Beautiful dress but was a bit small in size and does not stretch much. Would recommend buying a size larger. Otherwise very satisfied.
3.0,"From afar, it looks cool. You get closer, and it's really blurry and bad quality print. I won't buy again."
3.0,Strap is thin and not supportive of a heavier watch without sagging...<br />Holes for buckle tongue are small and hard to find.<br />Not something I would or purchase again...
3.0,"the thumbs and pointer fingers where the touch smart areas are, are too tight. i am returning them, and am not pleased to find out that this company does not cover shipping costs for returns."
3.0,"Fits small, bought for daughter who wears L for everything... this wasn't even close..."
3.0,The material is not cotton it’s. The material is good though . The Dupatta is made out of cotton but the skirt is like a poly silk material so not stretchy . I can’t say anything about the blouse since it was missing from my package :(. It’s pretty for a Hindu wedding especially when shopping last minute .
3.0,"The tines are thick and it takes a good deal of pressure to extend them.  OK for small items such as nuts for small threaded fasteners.  There are other similar grabbers for very small items which are easier to use.  Still, this one goes into the tool box."
3.0,"This case is the right size, but I really wish it had a hard shell."
3.0,"The fit is fine, just not sure if I like the fabric.  I also would have preferred longer length in the shorts.  Looks like it's made well though."
3.0,love these but make my feet hurt (not used to wearing heels)
3.0,nice band but not very long for a mens watch band
3.0,I washed this and have stretched it out while wet. Hopefully I will be able to wear it more than once.
3.0,"The top fit well, i ordered a medium, im a 34c. But the bottom was too small. They should have a way so you can change the size for the top and bottom."
3.0,"Ordered a XXL because the reviews said it ran small. I figured if it was a little big that was okay. Better big than small. I would say it's closer to a large. Especially after being washed. The buttons are not off to the side. They are completely centered which I don't like at all but whatever. Could be worse. I ordered the &#34;Blue-A&#34; and neither the inside of the hood nor the buttons are green. They are black. Not at all what I ordered. I would probably be more upset but it doesn't look bad. I was excited about the green so that's kind of a bummer. I have a pretty long torso so it isn't as long as in the picture but I kind of expected that. The material isn't terrible but I do suggest washing it after you try it on (to make sure it fits), before wearing for an extended amount of time. It does shed little fuzzies everywhere if you don't (my bad... I should have thought about that). The stitching isn't bad. My first time wearing it was on a 30° day and I didn't get cold at all and that's really what matters to me. I've seen some reviews that say the colors were lighter than pictured. The blue on this looks like the picture but obviously the green was not. All-in-all, it's a decent hoodie even if it isn't quite what I ordered. It's warm and that's all I need."
3.0,Colors and style were great
3.0,"This bracelet does not live up to the high quality level I experience with Alexis Bittar pieces. It looks like cheap junk.<br />Also, the highlighted gemstone is not as dark as shown in the photo. I bought the bracelet to match a hematite pair of Bittar earrings I already own. I do like the traditional watch strap closure feature.<br />This bracelet disappoints; I wear it infrequently."
3.0,"Missing a button and packed in a heap. I liked the dress but I feel like I got a returned one. It is missing a button on the side. It was not packaged well, sort of shoved into a bag rather than attempting to fold it. The dress itself is nice, but not so sure about the one in particular that I received. Fit is nice. To mid calf and enough room in large bust. I am not sure on my particular size lately so not sure if it small or true to size."
3.0,"The shirt is great. It’s list it as a blue shirt, it’s not blue its purple."
3.0,"Doesn't come with a chain, and it doesn't look like the one in the picture. But it's a cute crystal."
3.0,It looked great. I only used it for appearance not hold my keys but the clamp broke anyway. Still looks great but fall off every time I look.
3.0,"They're nice sturdy material similar to a seatbelt but some have a cool cross stitch to it. The buckles are nice but they can be finicky. The metal buckle one comes undone very easily and seems to loosen up slowly while worn. The plastic buckle is the exact opposite, it clips in so securely its difficult to pop the buckle open at times. It holds better than the metal buckle version but it's because it actually clips closed instead of just using the metal teeth to hold it on the metal version. Overall they're really nice looking belts and they keep my pants up."
3.0,For the amount of fabric and thickness these should be squat proof sadly they are so far from that I can see my butt crack while standing up… terrible quality.
3.0,A bit smaller than I would've preferred but it is very catchy. Would like to see the vendor make one even larger.
3.0,If you're large busted you may want to order a size larger than you usually wear.  Tight around chest.
3.0,I like it but the seam is much higher than on the picture. It is barely below my breat
3.0,"Don’t get me wrong I like a flowy dress! After having four babies they tend to be more forgiving. I’m 5’4” 170 lbs 32DD....this dress looked like I was wearing a tent. I could have taken it in 9in (at least) and still had a very cute flowy dress!! The straps, chest and length were all great but it was too much fabric! Will be returning"
3.0,The watch is so pretty my dad loves it the only thing is I thought it would ship in a box not in a small cloth bag
3.0,Two gems fell out within two weeks.
3.0,The chain makes my neck break out (which has never happened before) so I can only wear it with button-ups and turtlenecks. But it's gorgeous and it gets lots of compliments.
3.0,"The dress is very pretty in color, however it was a bit tight."
3.0,"I've always loved dexflex shoes from payless, so I was excited to find this item on Amazon. Though I don't need wide width, I chose the wide width so if I needed thicker socks for winter.<br />Well I was sorely mistaken here. While it fits ok throughout the shoe, it was difficult slipping the shoe on, and it's kind of tight around the ankles. Plus there is NO cushion or memory foam as advertised. :-(<br />Will I return? No. Too much work! Plus they're cute, and maybe I'll break them in at some point."
3.0,There's only one of them.  And they're super tight on your head.  I wear a 7 3/4 hat if that helps.  But it's still a pretty good headband.
3.0,Light weight and runs small
3.0,It's cute for the price
3.0,Very nice looking but too short i had to give it away to my niece
3.0,"The costume looks really good on (the pictures came out well, with my wife as Sally), but I could not keep the head on for long as it was hot and hard to hear anyone.  They make the costume only in large, so maybe it would be better for someone larger, but I could either see or breathe, but not both at the same time."
3.0,These are the only shades I wear and have owned several pairs over the years. I have a sensitivity to light. These cut down on glare but still allow me to see clearly and/or work on the computer. Can't beat them for the money. The only two draw backs are each pair after time has broken in the middle and the lens tend to fog.
3.0,"I'm a big fan of having some classic black basic pieces in my wardrobe for every season. This Charis Allure open front blazer misses the mark on a few issues for me. The blazer is lined which is a plus but the outer fabric, although lightweight and ideal for warmer weather, is a structured polyester weave and not a fabric I'm usually drawn to. They have also added sewn in shoulder pads which give's the blazer even more of a prominent silhouette. The blazer sits at waist length sitting shorter in the back and tapering longer in the front. Quiet honestly the shape reminds me of a maitred or server's jacket. Don't get me wrong, it looks good on but the shoulder pads are throwing me off as I haven't worn them since the 80's.  I think that I'll probably sew a hook and eye on the front to be able to close it and give it a more finished appearance. The biggest problem with the fit is the length of the arms. I am 5'6"", 127lbs and I usually have a problem with sleeves being too short for my lanky long arms. The arms on this Charis Allure blazer are inches too long. I've posted a photo to show you how they come down to my middle knuckles. So please keep that in mind as you may have a bit of alterations to do. I've posted some photos, one close up of the fabric and a couple more with me wearing it. I'm a failure at taking selfies but wanted to give you a better idea of what this looks like. I'm going to leave this one up to you, depending on your needs this may be the perfect blazer for your needs, but I honestly don't think it sparks joy for me. I do hope I've helped you out a bit with your choice."
3.0,Cute and a lot of stuff for the price but pretty bad chemical smell that won't go away. Had it for 2 months and even set it outside to air out.  Afraid to use the lunch bag and water bottle....doesn't seem food safe with the smell.
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this blouse and immediately tried it in. The outside draped nicely and was as expected. The inside layer however was really, really tight and mashed me and was uncomfortable. I decided if I cut the second inside layer, no one would know, and it would then fit great. Unfortunately, the outer layer is see through.🙄<br />Outside fit great. Inside layer fit like a small."
3.0,"The colors are not exact in picture.  The blue is more of a cobalt blue, not a teal as pictured.  The shape is as described."
3.0,"Pretty, but the back of the earrings are very long"
3.0,Was not the hunter green we were expecting... Nor the color it shows in the picture.<br />Was more like an olive
3.0,"This is made of a cotton t-shirt material.  It's a bit loose fitting, but the material has enough give to show off my rear.  This is more like a walking around summer outfit than club wear.  I'm hoping it will shrink in the wash.  This size is not for a 36C.  Go smaller."
3.0,"Definitely size up, otherwise cute dress or tunic."
3.0,I was looking for a modest swim short that would be something in between men's style swim trunks and bikini bottoms. These were a bit too close for bikini bottoms for me. They fit a bit small and didn't even quite come to the bottom of my butt. I returned them.
3.0,"The cover up was super cute but unfortunately was too large for me. I had to return it. The quality of it seem really good, which is worth the purchase if it were to have fit me. I am usually a S-M in clothes size but it ran too big. :("
3.0,I purchased 3 hats and all fit great.  I am happy with this purchase but the decoration around the brim needs to be attached as it keeps falling off.  I pinned it and will eventually sew it on.  Just a small detail but an important one.
3.0,"3 stars because it was too hard to figure out the size.  Read reviews to determine size.  I settled on a small/medium for my petite, 85 pound, 4’10’ daughter.  Fit her comfortably around the chest and waist, sleeves are long and bottom goes mid thigh.  Overall though, she absolutely loves it."
3.0,"The elastic on the very top is already ""dry"" in that after the first wash the elastic cracked and is no longer elastic."
3.0,This is extremely small. You can barely read the it.
3.0,Way too fancy !
3.0,"It's pretty. It has a 925 stamp on it marking that it's sterling silver but there's something about the way it looks that makes me question that aspect. For the price, it's nice."
3.0,Cute ..looks as described
3.0,"I love the style, and even the weight of the fabric, but it started “pilling” after one wash. It’s going to wear out pretty fast."
3.0,"I have 3 other pairs of Fryes & all in the same 7 1/2 size. I'm usually a 7 in other brands, but have a slightly wide foot & Fryes are narrow so I have to size up a bit. These boots are way too narrow even with my usual size up & if I went any bigger they'd look like clown shoes. They are lovely tho, sad to send them back. Frye, please make more wide shoe size options!"
3.0,Not flattering on me
3.0,very good my son loved them it's just that they are to slippery not enough grip
3.0,My daughter wears a US toddler size 5. And ordered a 6 and they barely fit. They are quite narrow and make the top of her foot look chubby. The shoe is well made though. I’d say buy 2 sizes up. If you have a wide foot don’t bother.
3.0,"Really just bought this for the leg garter things, which worked fine and didn't break after the two times of using them (which is saying something in comparison to the other goddess accessories on Amazon.)"
3.0,"I thought that since these said “Hypo allergenic” that they would be okay for sensitive ears. This was not the case. I wore them for about 8 hours and my ears were beginning to be infected. It was very disappointing. The needle part of the earring is also very sharp which makes them hard to sleep in. If your roll over, the earring is stabbing you. I was not very pleased with them."
3.0,These are super small.  The size of a robin's egg.
3.0,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and he really liked it- but it was a little small for his wrist. Other than that all acceptable
3.0,A little disappointed. Ear rings look much better on a picture than on ears
3.0,"Got 38 C,which is my normal size and it was way to big. Good material but definitely for a smaller figured female."
3.0,"I love the style and the color of the rain coat, that is why I ordered it. However the buttons on the sleeves do not match up and when the straps are attached, one sleeve is to tight, the other is very loose. The only way that I can fix it, is to detach and resew the buttons. Also as stated, it is somewhat small. I would recommend buying a size up from your normal size."
3.0,"I love these overalls, my only issue is that the clips on the strap slide very easy so I feel like I'm spending most my day readjusting the straps."
3.0,"I bought the next size up just in case I would have issues, and this is a good thing I did because it turned out iIneeded the bigger size do to my hips, thighs, and butt. The product does compress somewhat, but is loose at the inside knee area. It does feel nice with the material inside so I am hoping the sauna part will do better. So far I have not had any sweat although I don't really exerecise much so maybe in time it will work better. At least worth a try."
3.0,My kid wanted it so bad so I got it and she didn’t really enjoy it. She told me it was to tough.
3.0,"This dress runs large. I purchased an XL for my 32DDD bust size but it is GI-NORMOUS on me and very unflattering. I came back to buy it a size smaller but my desired color is not available in L. Also, the side pockets stick out oddly at the hip level. If I do find I’m able to buy this in the future I will be sewing those shut and cutting them out of the dress so it hangs better. Still an adorable dress and the fabric is soft and of a good quality."
3.0,Nice but one arrived with a scratch on it. Contacted the seller no response be sure to check each one closely. Would be a 4 but no contact from the seller didn't help.
3.0,"It is too big...but that's not always a bad thing.<br />I wish I would have realized how long it is. Im 5'6 it stopped a bit past my knee..so with the booties I wore with it it looks a little awkward.  But I'm sure it will be great round the house, let's do errands kinda throw on dress? Material is really light and breathable"
3.0,Size ran small and its see thru.  But otherwise a very pretty dress. Very light and comfortable
3.0,"When I think of chenille, I think of a somewhat heavy material. This robe is made from very thin material . The item wasn't what I expected ."
3.0,They were a little large to be a faux nose ring but I wanted something to get a feel for a variety of different piercings without the permanance and high cost. These are great for getting a general idea but since they are so large it won't give you an exact idea. I also didn't wear them for a long time so I'm not sure how they would last throughout the day but they seemed secure. A little hard to get on and a little uncomfortable.
3.0,It's a nice fashion dress.
3.0,No oo
3.0,Dress fit true to size. Seemed a little see through. I would have kept it but the polkadots were larger then I expected. Not a fan. Had they been tiny I would have kept the dress.
3.0,Materiel ok.
3.0,"The gloves are very nice! The rest is just what you kinda expect. Cheap children’s plastic jewelry. The ear ringing won’t actually clip to the ear and stay. The stones fell out of the wand with in 5 minutes of use. Gloves 5 star, the rest 1-2 star."
3.0,"These would be great if I had skinny feet .<br /><br />The bottom of the shoe comes up around the edges making then just too narrow.<br /><br />The part that goes between the toes is comfortable.<br /><br />I really wish they would have worked , they would have been nice summer shoes for around the house.<br /><br />If you have a regular width or narrow foot these will Probably be fine for you.<br /><br />I am a size 8 woman and ordered the 38-39"
3.0,"These are feathers glued onto cardboard,  basically.  The feathers were a bit crushed and didn't look like the picture. I ended up returning them and getting the less expensive ones ($15.99) from Party City, which were much nicer."
3.0,These run very small and are a tight fit.
3.0,Was delivered all smash waste of money should of went to walmart
3.0,I wanted a fun pair of glasses and thought for the price I would try these. The frames were not quite was I expecting- they are what you pay for. The nose piece looks slightly goofy for normal wear. Overall was an ok buy for the price.
3.0,The front of this was way shorter than the back.  At first i was confused as to what it was because it didn't really look like the picture.
3.0,"It’s cute, the fabric is thin. The bust part is made wrong in my opinion like my boobs flip out when I try tying it around."
3.0,"I ordered one size larger than I usually do, and I'm glad that I did."
3.0,"I was in LOVE with this. I ordered it for a fashion week event I was attending but was disappointed to find it’s definitely not made for short girls or girls with large breasts. The v is very deep it was almost pornographic. I’m a GG but I think if you’re over a D cup it’s probably risky. I ordered a medium because of my chest measurement and the body suit was long on me - but it’s still a “cheeky cut” so your booty is 100% out, and big in the waist. Ultimately I’m returning it because I can’t wear it unless I have it significantly modified in the chest and taken in everywhere else."
3.0,"They are soft and fit well, true to size. I am not a big fan though due to them always riding up in places they shouldn't."
3.0,Love the look but scratch very easily
3.0,The quality of the mental parts is great but the plastic breaks too easily. Be careful to not screw the ends on crooked
3.0,Glasses seem sturdy. I noticed a fair amount of reflection from my cheeks which is annoying. One earpiece screw was missing. But I remain hopeful that for $14 they are adequate to knock around in daily.
3.0,The pin brought on the same day I received it.
3.0,The size was mismarked on some of the tops in the package. One XL was obviously a M.
3.0,Not really xs. I had to sew the inseams in more: I am 5’ and 95 lbs.
3.0,It’s not the glasses fault but mine!! It doesn’t look good on me and I made a mistake buying it!! I didn’t think the lenses would look that cheap!! I’ll end up gifting it!!
3.0,"Wow, they ARE kinda small, but wearable, I suppose...they do have the novelty factor of being totally sheer, and the &#34;pouch&#34; puts your package WAY out in front!  I have to say that the fabric is somewhat on the rough side, but it doesn't quite chafe.  For some, it would be an issue.  I wear a size 34, and if there was an extra-large available, that may have been a more comfortable fit.  If you are larger than a 34, these will be like trying to put on boys underwear."
3.0,"It was fold multiple time and compressed that it left the front lines unglued. I didn't like the smell so I cleaned it with bleach, water,and that I had to repair it so I could have it for my grandson's birthday that same day it came in."
3.0,The knit material is very easy to make pulls.  I wore it one day and I already have a couple of pulls on it.
3.0,"Our daughter wears a 12 in every other shoe right now and the size 12 of these sandals isn't even close to fitting.  The foot bed is much too long and straps are way too large.  I would order a size smaller, or be prepared to return them."
3.0,So elegant and pretty. Perfect for my style.
3.0,Lindas pero muy estrechas de la punta si La Niña tiene un pie ancho no le sirve le quedan los dedos hacia afuera
3.0,I purchased this for off the shoulder tops and it arrived with permanent wrinkles on one cup and the band runs small
3.0,It says polyester in website but it’s kind of soft cotton . I was looking for polyester so I returned it .
3.0,Fits fine but missing breast support
3.0,Great build quality and exactly what I was looking for... except the 23in version does not have the cargo side pocket with separate zipper. It’s just one long zipper and one large compartment. Disappointed to receive something other than what was advertised and pictured when I bought it.
3.0,"I love my other 90 Degree pants (the solid colors). However, these heather ones are a different material and a different fit. I ordered the same size as my others but these have absolutely no give in them. They were skin tight. You could even see the lines in my &#34;no show&#34; underwear! The material is also not the same as the solid color leggings. This material is not soft, but more stiff almost. I will be returning this pair and ordering another solid color."
3.0,Trying to get use to these things.
3.0,"This swim cover is cute. Colors are vibrant and very pretty design. However, it seems really really thin, it may not last all summer."
3.0,"There's this plastic bone thing on the side, it bended and became painful... sure, it's wire-free, but... yeaaaah.... and I really wanted to like these... they're super cute...<br /><br />Also, the cups are a tiny bit big, I had to pull up on straps quite a bit..."
3.0,Definitely not high impact.  Not even close.  Would be good for yoga or something though
3.0,I do wish it had a better zipper.
3.0,Some clips are hard to open
3.0,It still fogged.
3.0,Loved the look but it comes off way to easy.  Watch fell off thankfully into my purse but could have cost me a lot of money.
3.0,Nice stitching.. material could be a little better.. fits right
3.0,"They are fine, but they are too granny panty for my taste and not hipster enough."
3.0,It was not as heavy as I anticipated and it just seems cheap to me. It is wearable but I almost sent it back.
3.0,"The fit felt nice in the beginning and I loved the leg length. However, they gave me a wedgie so I gave them away."
3.0,It is not true to size a bit larger than shoe size.  Looks more for girls than unisex
3.0,Material was thinner than expected & I had to hem it up 3 inches due to my height. Other than that it'll work as lounge wear.
3.0,"I ordered a size Large. A medium  would normally have fit fine but you never know on some things especially coming from other countries where sizing is different. The bottoms fit fine, but the top was too big across the back and slipped off the shoulders. The top was also much longer than the picture showed; and it also had buttons all down the front, which I didn't realize and didn't care for. Pretty color, but was not happy with it so I returned."
3.0,"shoes ok, just didn't fit."
3.0,"I  bought a pair of 34"" waist grey billabongs that were extremely comfortable and decided to buy a second pair of the same model. The second pair - same model, same waist, different color - was so much smaller than the first that they're slightly uncomfortable. Be careful."
3.0,"These shorts look and fit great. However, the regular front pockets are the size of pockets on girls' clothes. The cargo pockets are big enough, but the stuff I normally carry in my front pockets, like my pocket knife and my cell phone and my change, keep falling out every time I sit down. I won't be buying these again."
3.0,It is very pretty but way to small. It says one size fits most but I think is more like xsmall/medium
3.0,"Very cute overall. OK fabric, seam designs don't match up and some of the patterns weren't clearly printed on the fabric. However, my biggest problem was that despite having read the reviews regarding what size to order, I ordered a Large. I'm normally a dress size 4-6, so I ordered a Large in this shirt dress. It did not fit me in the shoulders or bust and also was a little bit tight around the hips. I wound up giving it to a friend who's very petite."
3.0,Earrings are very beautiful for the money and I would purchase them again. I'm giving the ones I purchased to my niece for a graduation gift I'm pleased.
3.0,"I have a full length waffle robe, so thought I would get another one for summer.  But the material on this is really stiff, not soft like my other one.  I have washed it a few times, but it remains stiff.  It fits ok, but since the material is stiff, it doesn't wrap around the body very well, so it seems a little small."
3.0,"Es mas pequeña de lo que esperaba, pero es muy bonita"
3.0,I was expecting a stiff sole as it's a true hiking boot but it is as flexible as a running shoe. I need more support so my feet don't get so tired while walking. These hurt soon after wearing and insoles didn’t help. I would have returned them but I was getting married at the time so by the time I got around to it it’s too late. So I guess I’ll use them for planters or something.
3.0,These boots are nice but the color is not as pictured. These boots have a weird pink undertone to them making them a weird color for a neutral boot. I have to return these as I can’t picture them with any of my clothing.
3.0,"They fit true to size... so if you wear an XL, I would buy and XL. I have not noticed ""EXTRA"" sweating like the description says... but what I like about them is that they keep the sweat concealed. So, during a workout, you don't have sweat lines/ marks on your shorts. After riding an exercise bike, there was no sweat marks or wetness on the seat."
3.0,"They would be perfect but the sizing chart isn't quite right. I measured my foot at 8.5&#34;, I needed the liners to fit into wader boots that are too big and wanted extra room for thick socks. I ordered a '4' thinking that would be the right size for what I needed but I can barely fit my foot in them. Maybe I didn't understand the sizing chart and ordered incorrectly but I am going to send them back if I can and get a few sizes bigger"
3.0,little bigger than i thought
3.0,"Fits across the shoulders, length is good, looks great, but if you don't have a pretty slim waist, you might want to look elsewhere."
3.0,"I like the bag, but the shoe compartment ripped out a few weeks after daily use started."
3.0,"Bought for 9 year old daughter. She is much taller than most 9 year olds and physically much more like a 12 year old. Based on size chart I order small, she is funny about the way her undies fit and normally only wears biy cut undies so I didn't want these cutting into her legs. I held them up next to her normal size 10 girls undies and the crotch looks nearly and inch below her normal ones. Just weighed her and she is 108, think we might exchange for size xs and see how that goes."
3.0,"I love these pants. The problem is actually getting what you order. I ordered the combo pack of black and navy blue jeggings. I got the correct black pair, but the other paid was a completely different material and was also black. I have no problem with the pants. I have a problem with the ignorant company that can't send me what I order.<br /><br />I am 5'5, 145 lbs - I ordered XL and they fit perfectly."
3.0,"I am 5'9"" and 140 lbs. I bought a medium. I bought these because I liked the texture. I do lack a bootie but that's not the reason I bought them. They were very small but also very stretchy so was able to fit into them alright. I didn't see any panties or bootie showing through when I squatted. I returned them though because they were just basically a big wedgie. They also didn't seem to do much for my butt besides make it look like I had a wedgie. They might have been slightly better if they were a large but I just wasn't crazy about them."
3.0,It should coming with a lace
3.0,stiff as a board
3.0,"I like them, but they run small. I wear a 10.5 or 11 and ordered a 46, but they're not really long enough. Other than that, they're good quality"
3.0,"I'll be honest and say this is based on my first impression.  It is lightweight, as described, and seems to be made with quality relative to the price paid.  My issue is that the fit is loose.  I have an average size head (or so I think), but this hat is pretty loose.  I'll update after my next fishing trip, but I'm guessing this hat will fall over my eyes while I have the neck tie pulled tight."
3.0,"Received the natural color, although I ordered coffee...no big deal as it was way too small. May give as a gift. Quality of hat was nice overall. Wish it had fit!"
3.0,Broke after 6 months
3.0,"The jeans were great quality, but I am 5’3 and 130 lbs and I ordered a medium. Too long and didn’t fit around my waist. Definitely should have gone with a small."
3.0,Its nice. I like the current picture and the color but it is really big.
3.0,"These are great and I wear them daily.  They do cut into the heels but I have started getting callouses there so no discomfort.  I sometimes will pop the heel strap on the outside of my black shoes to keep it from rubbing my heel.  I wish they'd make the heel strap out of a different material that was less likely to cut into the skin though.  Maybe something like they make clear bra straps out of?  Also, I have bought 2 packs and out of them had 3 different socks (so 1 1/2 pair total) get holes in the toe where the seams are so they are not very durable.  However, I like the design because they do not slip off my heel and gather under my feet like the low no show socks do."
3.0,It comes with the 3 tools I love them but is much more smaller than I thought… my fault I should to pay attention of the measurements that they showed
3.0,"It is much thinner than expected. I have to wear a camisole underneath but, otherwise ok."
3.0,I like the pants but the material is too thin easy to tear
3.0,I thought this looked like a silver/ gray but it is actually white.
3.0,"I actually love this dress, however, there’s no stretch...at all. I ordered a large, and it fits, BUT super tight and hard to sit in. I have a big booty, so if I didn’t have that, then it’d fit perfect."
3.0,"It's a cute top and I like the material but it runs quite large. I'm 5'6&#34;, 32C/27 waist and typically wear a size 2 and the small was too big. Wish there was a smaller size. Had to return it."
3.0,Just didn’t look right on me. Looks great on my sister!
3.0,"This hoodie is very fun, warm, and pretty.  I like that there's a chin strap so that you can take it off (push it back) and it will stay on you, separately from the pom-pom ends.  The material is soft, and it isn't shoddily made.  Unfortunately, the horn arrived bent from being mailed, and over a month later it hasn't worked itself straight.  It also fits too large, and flops over my forehead and eyes.  I imagine if I were to wear a wig with hair up, it would stay up better.  It did not fit as pictured, and I can only get it to stay on well if I tie the pom-pom parts pretty tight.  When I do that, it squares up instead of being nice and round as expected.<br /><br />It is still a fun little hoodie, but I would not spend this amount of money again for a similar product without trying it on first."
3.0,"I was worried these would run small and second guessed my sizing choice - I should have ordered XS. These fit but they're much baggier than I'd prefer them to be. That's on me, so it didn't affect my rating. The quality of the print is nice and they're comfy. Unfortunately, the elastic in the waistband came apart after the first washing, so now they're too loose for me to wear. I could tie them closed with the drawstring, but they bunch weird since the elastic isn't evenly distributing things. I would have to take them apart to fix them. I will probably end up dumping them at the thrift store, because I'm sure someone else who they fit properly would love them!"
3.0,"Really pretty dress and did have good amount of stretch, but not soft to the touch....."
3.0,It looks lovely but I'm short and it's to long. I will be returning the dress.
3.0,"I was nervous about the product due to the price, but I was surprised when I received it. It's such a beautiful piece! Although the tracking information was never updated, the necklace did arrive earlier than expected, which was a huge plus. The necklace was packaged in a long plastic bag, having the chain extended to prevent tangling.<br />The necklace itself is a steal. The butterfly gives off a nice shine and reflection. I haven't had any problems with the butterfly not being able to hold up and no diamonds have come off. Now, I hope no one was expecting real diamonds and chain, especially when you see the price, so, of course, discoloration can occur on the necklace. I, personally, haven't seen any discoloration on the necklace yet. I did remove the original chain and replaced it with one of my real gold chains, because I didn't want my skin to turn green in case of discoloration on the necklace. The original chain isn't tough, so too much pulling and twisting will most likely break it. My suggestion, if this will be a piece you'll wear often, you might want to use another chain you're comfortable with. Its a complimentary piece to wear at work and still beautiful enough to wear on a night out. I get lots of compliments on the piece. For the price I paid, I'm satisfied. No complaints here!<br /><br />UPDATE: Wore the necklace three times and the jewels on the butterfly's body has fell off. Still was a beautiful necklace, but beware, it won't last long folks."
3.0,"Runs small. It's a nice dress, item is as pictured. Size is just off. Will order a larger size and probably give this one to my sister."
3.0,"This was a Christmas stocking stuffer for my wife. Unfortunately,  as much as she loved the socks she had to return it because the fit is too small. Her shoe size is 9W. It will stretch to fit but then it's uncomfortably tight and you can barely recognize baby yoda."
3.0,They lasted about a day with our kids. They were cute and lit up very nicely but they came apart easily with use so I wouldn’t recommend if you have younger children but for older kids it was fun!
3.0,"It looks nice, but it will deteriorate kind of fast"
3.0,The material was not good
3.0,"they are too narrow, otherwise they are comfortable.  I wish they are just a little wider."
3.0,Like the shirt but its pretty shear
3.0,"The breast padding is way too low, like almost at my belly button and won't stay when I move them. If I can get that figured out, it'll be fine."
3.0,"This runs very small  and I didn't like the material, so I returned it."
3.0,It's okay and fits as expected.
3.0,"This suit is super cute and flattering. However, if you have a large bust, D+, it will not work. It fit everywhere perfectly except the bust. Sadly it must be returned."
3.0,It is a beautiful piece. But arrived with one of the gems missing. The missing gem wasn't even in the package it came in. It's not too big of a deal and I will wear it  but I hope no more will fall out as I have read in other reviews.
3.0,Pretty but very thin fabric
3.0,"I like the mask, good material, don't like the white inside...."
3.0,"The fingerless gloves are perfect for covering up while typing on a computer in a cold room.<br /><br />However, the elastic across the finger bases is a little too tight so it doesn't allow for great finger range while typing. If you keep all your fingers together, you won't notice. But as should as you stretch your fingers apart, you end up doing a mini finger work out.<br /><br />I've ended up cutting the elastic on palm side so I can have a better range of motion. They get the job done."
3.0,Zipper inside snags hair.
3.0,The top is even shorter than expected in the front.
3.0,The dress is a larger on the top maybe for a person with big boobs
3.0,I purchased an XL size so it could be washed expecting some shrinkage. It really is kind of small to begin with and not the quality you'd expect of an Anvil product. The fabric is quite thin.
3.0,This blouse is just okay.  Nothing fancy and it really looks like you have huge batwings.  Nice price and quick shipping.
3.0,Super cute but broke easily
3.0,"Fit cute. I let it fold over and it was so cute. Pretty cheap fabric, but to be expected at this price"
3.0,tight and restricting even though a size larger was ordered.  Gave them away.
3.0,"I am large chested, the straps were not long enough for me to cross. I wore them looped and they definitely like to detach easily. The lining skirt is very short. It is cute for a cheap dress, you just have to be very careful how you move in it!"
3.0,"I agree with the earlier reviewer who commented that this is way smaller in person than it seems in the description. It's also made of a very soft mystery metal that is white, but is definitely not stainless steel.<br /><br />The stones are surprisingly clear and of decent quality. The setting is well made, and the stones are securely set. The inside of the ring is not stamped.<br /><br />If you're going for the ""I inherited this ring and I'm stacking it up with random other rings"" look, go ahead and get this one. It's what--12 bucks? Go ahead, it's worth 12 bucks<br /><br />I"
3.0,"I bought this with the idea that it would fit. Went according to the size chart, it was way too small. But the material is quality and the workmanship is nice"
3.0,the size advertised was not american size
3.0,Okay nothing special!
3.0,I thought that would be a little more than three for the cost
3.0,I have a very slim torso and carry no weight in my tummy. the skirt was too small even though I bought up a size and the zipper won't go back up for some reason. It's cute though.
3.0,"The color of the camis pictured is more vibrant than what I received.  The fit was smaller than expected. The white was a different material offering little to no stretch as compared to the other camis.<br /><br />I do like the length.  I have not washed or actually worn them to comment on the wear or how they last after washing.<br /><br />The material is pretty thin, but I expected as much after reading the other reviews."
3.0,"I have not used it much, but it seeks like it will do the job."
3.0,"the jacket is too big for size 6, i did alteration on it."
3.0,Not the worst but definitely not my style of hat. Doesn't look anything like it appears online when you receive it. I'm sure some consumers are happy with it. Just not for me. Returned it.
3.0,"Beautiful material, but not as fitted as expected. The undergarments that came with it are too small, but I need it for my birthday in September so I'll work on me and make it work!"
3.0,Like the color and fabric<br />But cut very full
3.0,They are too big I need smaller size can I still exchange. Them
3.0,Wrong color sent but needed it for a trip. Quality is ok.  Large enough for everything I needed to take.
3.0,"Very stiff. I soaked it in water to try and soften, but it's nylon. Duh, that didn't do anything. Maybe I can loosen the weave by stretching it."
3.0,"The lenses are great, the frame, however, does not sit on my head properly... they go straight back and do not bend like normal glasses.  I cannot even put them up on my head when I walk inside a building because they just fall off."
3.0,"I hate leaving poor reviews, but this is kinda important... Very nice mask, but the navy text is basically illegible. For me, that is unacceptable considering the cost and the amount of time it took to get here."
3.0,It looks smaller than in pictures. Plastic seemed dirty. Read other reviews saying the same. I wouldn't purchase again
3.0,Really cute but the blue design started wearing off within 3 months. My daughter was disappointed.
3.0,Luv it but it's too small. Even went up a size like the reviews said. I'd definitely go up 2 sizes.
3.0,"Loved the color but was looking for a longer flowing top. This top did not loosely fit loose and it  hung tight at the top of the hips.  Reference 5’6, 155 pounds."
3.0,Just need to be a little bigger!
3.0,"Very nice, can wear with anything."
3.0,"it's a really nice choker and i still wear it but the band was inside out on mine. the soft part was outside and the leather type part was inside. however, its all good material."
3.0,You have to order a size thats 2 larger than your normal size.
3.0,It's hard to open and then you have to flip down the top part. But other then that it's  not bad
3.0,I love this brand ! But the individual pairs are stronger. The gift set feels like very thin socks and the support is not as strong.
3.0,Keeps rolling down from the back. Not as high as I expected. Have to return
3.0,Needed to order 2 sizes smaller!
3.0,too tight to get cards out
3.0,I only received 11 pairs of earrings.
3.0,"I like this bracelet. I am considering buying more for Christmas presents. It will work well for men, women, or teens. Nice that it is adjustable in length so it can fit a a lot of different people."
3.0,"The packaging was great, however when I opened the packaging to get the necklace out it was broken already. :/ I had to fix it before I even got a chance to wear it. Once fixed however, I loved it!<br />Unfortunately the necklace broke again that same night. Other than that I did love how this looked on me for the few hours it was on. :)"
3.0,"Didnt fit as I intended, Nice design though."
3.0,Disappointed.  Very lightweight.  I will need to put plastic stops on the back of the wire's to keep them in my ears.
3.0,Nothing like expected. Loved the green tone but it was very small. Giving it to my niece.
3.0,"Runs small, so order 2 sizes up.. Good price,  thin material.."
3.0,"Although they are a 2/26, they are about 4” too long. Disappointing"
3.0,The brim was too floppy and cumbersome so my son didn't want to keep it on. I went ahead and paid a little extra for a REI hat that has a stiff front and floppy back and looks cuter than iplay one too.
3.0,"The quality of this sweater was lacking . The sleeves were very short, not short enough to be a 3/4 sleeve, but not long enough to meet my wrist, and the company's defense I do have kinda long arms. . I will be shipping this one back. I did give it a 3 because I did think it was cute and had the sleeves been long enough, even though it wasn't the highest quality, I probably would have kept it the color was good. I liked the gray speckled."
3.0,"I love my daughter’s other Robeez boots, which fasten with a zipper.  These fasten with a small patch of velcro which easily rips opn with active play.  Very cute, comfortable, warm, easy to put on, soft sole easy for a baby who is not steady on her feet... but ultimately not recommended because they don’t stay on.  Try the robeez wyatt boots if you don’t mind that they are made for boys."
3.0,Found that i dont wear it as often as i thought i was...
3.0,"They are nice, but not quite as plush as in the picture.  They are good, and I may buy them again, if the price is right."
3.0,This is an ok dress. I’m 5’3” & it reaches above my ankle. The chest area is snug if you have D+ chests.
3.0,Pretty but did not look anything like the photo which is what I wanted and ordered
3.0,"On the sleeves they were not tapered, or elastic to be tight at the end of sleeve that is all I didn’t like,"
3.0,For $24 dollars I expected a much thicker fabric. It looks good and the cut is good but returned it because I felt it wasn't worth the money.
3.0,A little larger than expected after going by the posted measurements. The shoes are cute so I kept them.
3.0,"I purchased this bag a few months ago, and decided to leave a review. Especially, since I have some travel experience with it now too! Perfect carry on bag, which is a plus for all you frequent flyers.<br /><br /> The bag at first glance, is visually stunning! Practically, the perfect weekend bag. The only issue I have with the bag, is the inside sewing. Not only did I receive the bag with the stitching unraveled, but one of the inside pockets is hanging down because of it. Now, same thing is starting to happen on the middle seem, at the bottom of the bag...unraveling thread mayhem."
3.0,"Ok for the money. Picture makes it look better than it is tho - in no way shape or form is this a passable realistic period ruff, but it you need something quick for Hween, then go for it."
3.0,"Love the color , fits well only problem they are to long."
3.0,little expensive and a day late on delivery
3.0,The (&#34;Z&#34; strap) and (flip flop) are as different in fit as day and night.....
3.0,Good pair of leggings for summer time because of their color and thin material. I was expecting something made out of better material. I do not think they would look nice after couple of washes. They do not fit like typical gym leggings which you do not have to pull up every time you bend or change position. So if you are hoping to do some squats pick a different pair of leggings. Also the desing does not look as flattering as on the picture.
3.0,Cute Extra Bag I Have
3.0,It's alright but I got the wrong color..
3.0,Not as expected.  OK but looks better in picture than in reality.
3.0,"Not exactly like the picture ,runs small"
3.0,Okay shirt. Maybe it's my sensitive skin but the material has a weird scratchy texture.
3.0,"This dress was okay, not the most flattering fit but it was fine to throw on as a t-shirt dress for the beach."
3.0,Haven't tried them out yet . Very cute just may be to small
3.0,"This is a nice, long, elegantly flowing wrap.  It runs a slight bit small, but still fit me.  It's pretty enough for work or church, but also works well with jeans.  It's light weight, more for summer than winter."
3.0,They do not unsnap easily
3.0,"It was an ok item , it could have been assembled with better product ."
3.0,"I did not like the length nor the fit at the waist.  Too loose at the waist and so short that I will have to wear with ""high rise"" pants or a jacket."
3.0,material wasnt great... too thick
3.0,Material is too light to absorb any water. Size not accurate. Can't give a good wrap around the body and too short. However will use it for other purposes around the house
3.0,"Nice Product, but be sure you understand the earrings are quite small. Good Sterling Silver Material, with excellent clips."
3.0,"The dress part fits pretty well. I'm 5'3 and if I pull it aaaaaaaall the way up to just under my bust, it barely drags on the ground :). The halter top though, just is not made very well, especially if you have a larger chest. I'm a DD and the amount of side boob showing was just way too much. They wanted any excuse just to pop out. I tried tying the halter a couple of different ways, and even tried using a backless/strapless bra to reign them in a bit but no matter what I did with the top, it just looked a bit trashy. I opted to cut the halter portion off and am just wearing a low cut tank top with the dress instead. It still looks good, and I get the satisfaction of knowing my ladies are in place for the entire evening. I do love the color and shimmer of the dress for sure, it's just a shame about the halter. If you're good with a needle, you might remove/re-add the strips a little farther apart and that could potentially fix the issue."
3.0,"Pretty dress, sheer. Too small for the sizing chart I used.  Worked for my sister who looks like she doesn't eat, not for me- who has mom boobs & had a 4th baby.  I'm 6' & thought the length was nice... just too tight around bust."
3.0,"Not true size. Cute, well made, just didn't fit."
3.0,My son wears these nearly daily and have not broke but do discolor his fingers
3.0,Like the material not the best fit around the shoulders especially when being wide. A little big I would stick to your size and not size up like I did.
3.0,"Quality as good as always, but this blue koala sleep set is not the same product as shown. It doesn’t have high waisted band which is very disappointed me. The reason I bought this product was the high waisted band."
3.0,"After only 1 year of having this key ring, almost all the paint had been worn off.  other than that it was very nice while it lasted"
3.0,Nice but too heavy and thick.
3.0,"Somewhat small at the top, the rest of the sock is fine."
3.0,the straps came off as soon as I tried it on.
3.0,Dainty. Hard to put on. Kind of hurts to wear.
3.0,"First, I would be a &#34;verified purchase&#34; except that I bought these directly from Lego.com.<br /><br />We held a Ninja / Ninjago-themed birthday party yesterday, and we offered 5 of these bandanas to the boys as team costumes for the 3, 5, 6, 9, and 9 year olds.  The material was far LESS flexible or expandable than expected.  Since the packaging label states &#34;6+&#34; in the upper left, I interpreted the information as a sign that the bandana was sized for the average sized youth's head (at least, I assume that my kids and the kids in my neighborhood are not mini-giants).<br /><br />The material had a nice design, but I was surprised at how hard it was to slide the tubing of material over any of their heads (particularly the ears)...the boys all required adult help, and they could not comfortably configure the tubing into the &#34;Cover the head and mouth&#34; configuration.  They could perform the &#34;mouth mask&#34; picture and the &#34;head sweat band&#34; picture.  Removal of the material was also snug, almost to the point of pinching their hair.<br /><br />Perhaps the &#34;6+&#34; label is for safety purposes and kids not choking on the material?"
3.0,The clover fell out within a week.
3.0,"Overall, I'm getting used to these glasses and I lean toward liking them.  The bridge is a bit wider than expected, but I guess that's based on the shape of your nose/face.  I do wish the lenses were mirrored a bit, but again, that's just personal preference.  I like the case and the pouch that came with them.  Originally, I had picked out another pair of &#34;steampunk&#34; styled sunglasses, but when I went back to order them they weren't available anymore."
3.0,"I guess I expected it to fit differently than it did. It wasn't super flattering on my figure, almost tent like. I think it could work with a belt, though. Nice dress, good quality. I'm 5'6 155lbs 33-28-39 and I ordered a medium"
3.0,Super adorable. Wish it fit. :( Just toooooo big!!
3.0,Not worth the money<br />Cheap material and shrunk in wash<br />Color fades
3.0,"After reading the reviews I wanted to love this top but it didn't happen. The fabric is thinner than anticipated. I like my tops loose and flowy, so I went up a size.  It fit, but, it was not loose and flowy. It was clingy, but not tight. It stuck to my pants (static cling?) instead of sliding across them. IDK if a larger size would help that.  Maybe if I washed it, that would help? But, if I wash it I can't return it."
3.0,"Not as supportive as I would want, but maybe good for others"
3.0,Cute but runs small.  Luckily my daughter liked it and it fit her and so I did not have to send it back.
3.0,"Arms are too short, must be China sizing as I normally have the opposite problem. Otherwise I like it"
3.0,Boots are true to size fit-wise; but as usual you get what you pay for.  Quality is fair.  The boots have started to come apart after only a few wears.
3.0,"These could be much better if they were sold by size than by a range of sizes.  Well it did fit my shoe after the insert was removed, it was still too large and I got a blister because it wasn't sitting or seated correctly in the shoe itself. I would recommend cutting it to fit the foot before putting it in the shoe."
3.0,"Liked the denim look of the hat, but was disappointed the Triumph logo was just an iron on. Should have paid closer attention, used to a nicer made logo."
3.0,I found the rhinestones make it hard to slide the belt through the belt hoops but with a little tugging it goes through. Concerned the rhinestones wont last long if you have to do that.
3.0,These tops look great and are comfortable but when I run I find myself pulling my top down. It defeats the purpose of a work out top. I gave 3 stars because they really do look great and I ordered and extra large and I liked how it went below my waist and the material seemed to absorb the perspiration. I am 5'1 and weigh 187 lbs.
3.0,It had a lot of loose threads and pokets had holes.
3.0,Good item with new design
3.0,The top part was super cute but having a long torso made it way too short and inappropriate for my work party. had to return it sadly. Wish they had a plus sized version
3.0,"Very pretty color, quality of material and all also very good, the reason I'm giving this item a 3 is because the way bra is made is not nearly is wide set as it is on the picture, I'm 5'7 34B, the triangles themselves sitting way too slose together, it's not too terrible, but I wish it had more room in between, like it does on the picture. The underwear are cute, but covers very small part of the butt, so if you want to maximize the tan and minimize the tan line it's a way to go!"
3.0,"I bought pink one and burgundy one. Thouse are very different dusters.Material and style are totally different. PINK is straight shape 100%polyester. BURGUNDY  is short in the back, long on sides,65%cotton poly blend.I bought the biggest sizes available what are L in pink and XL in burgundy. BURGUNDY fit better, but I like the straight, simple style of the pink.Still don't know which one I will keep.<br />I am 5'7&#34;,210 pounds"
3.0,uncofortable
3.0,"I ordered two of these hoping they would both have pink and purple beads but neither one of them did.  Both rings have blue and yellow beads, which are okay, but my nieces love pink and purple.  That is why my rating is just 3 stars.  Other than that, the rings looks exactly like the picture (except for color variation)."
3.0,"I was a fan of their Slim Sleeve wallet even though the first one I got had some definitely quality issue but the subsequent one was better, but not perfect, with varying degree of imperfections but as I've been told, it is part of their ""personality"".<br /><br />When I lost my wallet and saw they came out with the Note Sleeve I was ecstatic, ordered it right away, since the whole bill folding was an annoyance. The card sleeve and quick access slots are definitely the major selling points of this product for me. I've found the SIM card slot useful also for international travel but those with iPhones will need a full size SIM adapter in order for it to work.<br /><br />I've had this wallet for over a year now and visually it has not held up too well. According to their site this is expected "" develop a patina quickly, showing marks, usage and character much sooner"", but still surprising how terrible it looks compared to a wallet half the price. Some people call it character, but to me it ends up making it look much older and worn than it really is.<br /><br />The main gripe about this wallet is which I think makes it almost pointless to choose over the Slim Sleeve, is that the note compartment is just barley enough to fit bills. Like one of the previous reviewer says, they have to be perfectly aligned or you just end up with a mess, quite a hassle especially when you are trying to quickly shove your change back into the wallet and move out of the way. I find this makes it no better than folding the bills."
3.0,"The colour of the frames are stark ivory.  Whereas, the colour looked more muted cream online.  The frames are of good quality, but I’m not sure that the stark white compliments my skin tone... I think these frames suit a fairer skin tone."
3.0,"They look good, but are not very comfortable"
3.0,"After a few wash/dry cycles, this shirt really shrunk length wise. Now if I raise my hand the bottom of the shirt comes well up past my jeans waist band."
3.0,"These glasses look exactly like the picture and feel very well made. Unfortunately, I took them on my beach vacation right after I received them and the finish started peeling off. I was very careful with them. Didn't drop them, kept them in a case when I wasn't wearing them and was careful cleaning them. I believe the salt air was just too much for them to handle. If they were just normal daily wear and not seeing the salt air you may have different results."
3.0,Seems to run a tad small. :/
3.0,Quality not so great. Returned.
3.0,"I liked the necklace, it was a bit smaller than I had imagined it to be."
3.0,"The look and the fit is fine, but I'm not convinced that the quality of metal is as advertised. I was pierced with a stainless steel post and never had a reaction, but after one day wearing this, my nose started swelling up and was very sore. Just beware if you're the type of person who has sensitive skin."
3.0,"bought it for the 11 year old, almost fits the 6 year old ... like a dress but still, very close to fitting well, she wore it and it looked cute."
3.0,Very heavy had scratches on them overall nice look
3.0,Really pretty but too small. Go for a size bigger just in case.
3.0,Soft and comfortable. Fits very large  I usually wear 2 x in shirts but this material large may have fit better.
3.0,"I received this Message Charm Bracelet on a Sunday which is always a nice surprise, to receive a weekend delivery.  I ordered the &#34;Believe' charms which included an oval shaped charm that says &#34;Believe&#34;, a clear bead charm, a round charm with a floral print and a heart charm that says &#34;Made in the USA.&#34;  I did have to tighten the hoops that hold the charms onto the bracelet for fear they would come off.  On some of the other reviews I noticed people receiving 5 charms on their bracelets where I received 4.  Maybe it depends on which one you order? One thing I found interesting is that in the item description it highlights that it &#34;COMES IN A GIFT BOX!&#34;  Like this is the very best part of the bracelet purchase.  It came with a plain white box and a plastic lid, nothing fancy at all and in fact it looked rather cheap. It is a pretty bracelet, looks very dainty and would make a nice for a younger sister or friend.  I can't really picture an older woman wearing this bracelet because the charms are a little whimsical and might not look the same on a more mature woman.  I'm not sure it would be able to stretch wide enough to fit over a larger hand.  It would have been nice to have received a piece of paper or note saying &#34;Thank you for purchasing our product, we appreciate your business&#34; but it came with nothing other than the not so fabulous gift box. I did receive this bracelet at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review which I have given.  I take the reviews on Amazon seriously and I hope mine helped in your buying decision."
3.0,They are not advertised as Velcro. Not happy when they came in the mail with no shoe strings.
3.0,I dont see a difference lol
3.0,they are too large for my regular glasses so sit too low otherwise they are fine
3.0,"after wearing them all day and taking them off, my sight is kind of glazed...."
3.0,Colors that were advertised was not what I got.
3.0,Can't be put in the dryer.
3.0,I have two pairs of these pants in the color 'Navy'. They are perfect fit and get a 5 start review. However I have one pair in 'Gray' and they are not the same fit. The gray are Very low rise and fit much smaller than the Navy ones. I wish that if you order the exact same pants at the same time from a seller that they would have the same fit.
3.0,They cute but they just a lil to thin
3.0,comfy but a little tight .. I guess if I ordered again I would go bigger then an Xl
3.0,Nice belt but the adjustment area is too small. It ends up leaving a Long tail on the end of the belt hanging loose at the  Front of your pants . Needs about 2 1/2 inches more of an adjustable area which would reduce the tail that hangs in the front. Otherwise works great  and I love the buckle..
3.0,"Nice, but loose"
3.0,I have a 7 1/2 hat size. Somewhat tight fit. This is not one size fits all. It is a very nice hat though and very warm for people with smaller hat sizes.
3.0,"Quedan muy bonitos solo que la calidad no es muy buena, la parte donde se pega luego se cae"
3.0,"They hurt my feet, the leather was stiff."
3.0,"Fits a little small, it is very cute and would have been perfect for our sons 2nd birthday in Disnay World, but took a very long time to get. It didn’t arrive until after we were home from our trip. If you are going to order this give yourself at least a month before you need it."
3.0,"I bought this several sizes too big because of the reviews and it was still pretty snug. The slit in the back was also really high. The fabric was pretty, but this just wasn't for me."
3.0,"This is a very small wallet.  Husband complains he can't fit anything in it.  Otherwise, it's very attractive."
3.0,"This skirt is great. It’s a nice quality, and while it’s not altogether see-through, I recommend wearing a slip underneath. My biggest issue: sizing! I’m 6’1” and wear a size 2/4. Based on reviews, I sized up to a Large and really should have ordered an Extra Large. In this picture, the elastic is fully stretched, and it’s snug.<br /><br />***Tall ladies, be aware this skirt still doesn’t make it to ankle length. On me, it falls 3-4” above the ankle when the skirt is worn at waist level.<br /><br />For the price, you can’t go wrong."
3.0,"These water shoes continue to do the job. However, the stitching is fraying around where the sole meets the shoe and the insoles constantly slide out of the shoes."
3.0,Too small better ask 1 size bigger
3.0,Very long!
3.0,Decent for just regular wear not great for competive as a few times my done got a fish of water in them .. it does fog .. and doesn’t last more than 3-4 months tops . Plastic clip breaks
3.0,Kind of thin material shrunk quite a bit even on cold and hung dry
3.0,I am 5’7” 150 pounds and the large was way too small. Order up a size or 2!
3.0,"This ring looked nice when I got it. In fact, several people have complimented me on it. I had to tell them it want real but costume jewelry. However, two weeks after wearing it the &#34;stone&#34; came off. I had to glue it back on, but of course now it doesn't look as good as it did. Looked nice for a while, anyway."
3.0,It's pretty but sorry to say I haven't worn it as of yet but looks like it will fit.
3.0,"It's okay for the price. With really, really cheap stuff from Yazilind, expect chains to snap and parts to break easily. I wouldn't recommend this as a gift for these reasons. If it's for your own use, and you have reasonable expectations, it's very pretty costume jewelry that requires repair to you want to wear it more than a couple times."
3.0,Love it just not a big as I hoped
3.0,Bag is cute but fabric feels really awful
3.0,Pretty small but overall good condition but this should be listed as a kids watch bcuz of how small it is
3.0,I don't like it because the bin doesn't flip.
3.0,Love the look and lightweight design. These white shoes were perfect for my daughters dance competitions. Unfortunately only after three wears the tie completely broke. Amazon would not return or replace damaged merchandise.
3.0,the Sleeves move up past my elbows and feels like it's cutting off circulation.  rest of it fits.
3.0,I went by the sizing recommendation but that is way off. The 32-34 size is huge. I measured them and they were 36-38 waist and the legs came down past the knee. I am 6 foot 180 pounds and normally wear a 32 or 33 waist for reference.
3.0,"Very pretty, just extremely see through so be prepared to have to wear a full slip or sew your own lining underneath"
3.0,"I was so excited for this mask. I was planning on using the mask for a Halloween outfit. When it arrived, the box the mask was inside of had already looked like it was opened, no tape holding it down and the box was a bit damaged. I was skeptical but the mask had been wrapped in alot of bubble wrap so I thought it was fine. The mask looked wonderful, I was very pleased with how it looked, until I noticed there was a large crack on the side, all the way to the eye area. Then I looked around to find anymore cracks, and I found 2 more. On one of the cracks, there was even a small piece of the mask chipped off. I had to super glue the mask back together. Also, the back piece of the mask fits weird, having a large gap between the 2 pieces. No padding or straps inside to hold your face in place, it just sits on your head. Thank God I was able to get a refund, that's why I gave a decent review, and it is still wearable, but I shouldn't of had to piece my mask back together. Other than that, I'm still impressed on how the mask looks, it looks very beautiful, and besides the cracks, there was really nothing wrong with it look wise. I do plan on getting another one, hopefully, it won't come broken next time."
3.0,Worked so well!
3.0,"The organza tore after two wears. Overall it's cute and fun, but I recommend buying one made of tulle not cheap organza."
3.0,Great tack for the price. If your looking to get a tack to hold your tie  you can't go wrong with this one. Nice piece and cheap price
3.0,"I went through two pairs of these already.  The demise of the second pair prompted me to write a review.  Functionality-wise, these are perfect for what I use them for -- as home footwear.  The amount of pressure they generate is good, once you get used to it the very first time you put them on.  The problem is they last a year (daily use at home with long breaks, not constant walking).  After a year, the strap on one of them inevitably breaks.  Proven twice already.  So, if you are willing to make this an annual investment, they do what they are intended to."
3.0,"I bought these as stocking stuffers for the kids at Christmas.  All 40 arrived in one bag.  I knew immediately what was in the bag because one of the lights had been stuck on and was making the bag glow.  I received all 40 in their correct colors.  6 did not work (I assume the batteries had run out because the internal connections looked correct).  1 had a tough switch.  1 had part of the plastic broken off, but was still ok.  The functional ones were very bright and satisfactory.<br /><br />I was hoping to give 10 separate kids 4 each, but since 6 were non-functional, I decided to give 2 kids something else ... luckily not all the kids will know what the others got!<br /><br />Bottom line is that I was shooting for a cheap gift to give the kids at least 10 minutes of fun and that's overall what I got.  I am glad that only 6 were bad; it could have been a lot worse reading other people's reviews."
3.0,Eventually received the item.  Item is as described.
3.0,Way to small. Definitely go up a size!
3.0,I really likes this but it broke the second day. It was easy enough to fix but who wants to fix something they just bought.
3.0,Dress didn’t have the new tag/label.
3.0,nice quality garment but not meant for adult human beings to wear. The size I ordered (as an adult grown woman) will be lucky to fit my child who is under 10 years of age.<br />she will have a lovely time wearing it to bed so that is the only positive. I would have sent it back if not for her.
3.0,Is overly big and a bit cheap-- especially the zipper-- but a nice design.
3.0,I love this but unfortunately the solid star was missing a rhinestone right in the middle. I have friend who makes jewelry hopefully can fix for me.
3.0,the glasses fit my daughter well but the wand was way too big and awkward looking.
3.0,"Kinda flimsy, some fraying of the threads, but it'll do."
3.0,Size and shape are great.  Quality is medicre
3.0,There o.k but areas of the shorts are coming lose . I wood buy again but out of stock.
3.0,"Just got mine in - not nearly as nice or soft as Kaos Softwear silicon retainers (1-sided flesh-toned tunnels), but they do the job ok."
3.0,"Good for hiking, working around the house or casual fashion. They look good on, but are definitely NOT made for combat operators, SWAT, LEO's.<br /><br />1) Fabric- Soft, stretchy, breathable fabric.<br /><br />2) Fit- I am athletic build, but not big muscles. These are ""form fitting"" but with a little slack so they aren't painted on. My GF absolutely loves them on me. Says they accentuate all the right places.<br /><br />3) Pockets are great. Very deep back pockets will accommodate an asp/extenda baton. Great velcro flap closure pockets on front of each thigh for knives, ammo clips, etc., Deep cargo side pockets with zipper closure.<br /><br />4) Stitching - First washing made the top edge of the right front pocket come unstitched from it's anchor point on one end. (see image). I only took off one star because this could be an anomaly. And I'll just sew it back myself.<br /><br />5) Closure - Only a button atop the zipper fly. Surprisingly there's no additional support like an internal hook, no internal velcro or external flap. Just a single button holding on for dear life. Wearing a belt helps.<br /><br />Overall I like them. May buy another pair in different color to see how they hold up."
3.0,A little prickly with the glitter honestly thought it was going to be better but it doesn't look bad
3.0,Fit is boxy do not like shape
3.0,"Neck is not crew, but bigger. No problem, just wear a t-shirt underneath.."
3.0,"Ordered this for my sister since it looked cool and Amy is her name. When the package arrived, I it was the incorrect necklace. It was funny and I still gifted it to my sister as a joke. Good thing it was going to a family member rather than a friend whom I drop-shipped to.<br /><br />As for the quality, you get what you pay for. For the money, it's the quality is good. Everything is metal and gold plated. The chain does have a tendency to knot up if you don't hang it while storing it.<br /><br />In parting, great gift, just doublecheck the packaging prior to gifting to ensure its the correct name."
3.0,OK so the bottoms fit... I am a size 12 (maybe 14)  the top OMG does not fit!!! I wear a 38 D... and this is WAY too small!!!
3.0,Got a new car that I would jazz up my keys.  It took about 3 weeks and it came apart.  I could have put it back together but I didn't.  Would have had to purchase new screws and did not want to deal with it. It was not bright and shiny.  It had a dull finish.  I think that was the way it was suppose to be.  But I wanted a shiny surface.
3.0,"It's not bad, but sizing is VERY small!! I am pretty slim, and size small bottoms are way too tight. It also isn't push up like it says. The design is a bit different than the picture, and looks a bit messier. Lastly, some stitching is messy and is pretty visible. But for the very cheap price, I guess it's a good deal!"
3.0,The chain is shorter then I expected.
3.0,Very Cute but I had to return mine. I ordered a (M) then I ordered a (L) to see how that would work. I received a (L) and it fits great.....just a little tight in the bust area. The zipper also had to be replaced.
3.0,"The booties are made with a soft material.  There is padding inside, which makes them comfortable.  They do run about 1/2 size (or a bit more) smaller & seem to be on the narrow side.  I wear a 7 1/2 & the size 8 just barely fit.  I think they will be a great transitional bootie for the warm Fall in the south with skinny jeans.."
3.0,"So I am a 35 yr old mom of two tween girls. We go to the lake A LOT during the summer. So I was looking at just getting some basic bottoms to rotate with my tops as my bottom and top are completely different sizes due to having an enhanced chest.<br />The Ocean Blues Women's Loop Tie Side Hipster Bikini Bottom advertise as a medium coverage bottom. NOPE not really! Wearing a Brazilian cut with my kids is not something I am comfortable with so these are for only when it is just me and the hubby out on the water.<br />The material is nice quality for the price, and if you were like a 22 yr old, sure.. Have at it. But it really isn't something that I personally am comfortable with!"
3.0,"I've done martial arts for over 25 years. There is always a snag for footware in that field. So I found the claim dubious; and was proven right.<br /><br />The ""grip"" is 2 textured areas on the ball and heel that is applied; meaning it will wear off with heavy/frequent use. The grip is fast, so that is good for Yoga. But for Martial Arts the grip keeps turning/spinning from being fluid. And the sock aspect means your foot moves around once the grip applies (see the picture where i am pulling them back).<br /><br />I found the cutouts for the toes to be tight. However I will grant that can be just a matter of breaking them in.<br /><br />*If you do more postion switches (i.e. Yoga) these are just fine. But saying good for Martial Arts is a 'Your Mileage May Vary'"
3.0,So the bottoms are amazing very soft fits well I'm a b cup and the top is barley fitting i would say size up one if you get this The quality is great
3.0,Fashionable<br />Not so great material but for the price if good
3.0,"Pretty print and fabric is soft, but I feel like I need to grow about 8 inches for the length to be right."
3.0,Didn’t like the way it look on me.
3.0,I had no problems with this necklace.  It was in tact when I received it and it looks exactly like the picture. It's beautiful.
3.0,"It's okay, I bought it as a gift for a friend who was stressed from studying for the finals. It's cute."
3.0,I would give this a 5 star but unfortunately there wasn't a reindeer on the pants only snowflakes but I am a size 18 and these fit just fine very soft and warm wash up great
3.0,"They're cheap compression stockings, you get what you pay for. They do the job but won't last long and will need replacing in a month so I will be buying new ones a little before then. The zipper isn't really an asset as it falls down and you can't zip them up you still have to roll them on like regular compression stocking which is what I'm going to get next time."
3.0,Quality is good although they seem to be orange red in photos but were actually hot pink when I received them :(
3.0,"Made really thin , I did not like the looks of it , so I returned it."
3.0,Did not fit. And I couldn't return them.
3.0,"It is fine for a day when you only want to carry your phone, a card or two and a little cash.  You might be able to squeeze a small feminine product or other small, very flat item in it.  But the card slots are very tight, and it doesn't hold enough for daily use.  At least not for me."
3.0,"I would have liked this product better if the material was softer.  It was a bit stiff, even after washing, and kind of low quality cotton. I had expected the cotton to be soft and stretchable if that makes sense, but it was kind of stiff.  I would not buy this product again."
3.0,"Super cute! I wasn't expecting such a costumey look to it but I still think it's cute. :3 I wish it was made with a different fabric so that's why I only gave it three stars but that doesn't bother me, I'll still love it nonetheless :D"
3.0,"It’s comfortable, adorable and I love the look but it forms little pills and it’s starting to show some wear already and it’s only been a few weeks. I won’t wear this all the time to extend the life of this band. I do really like the look and feel though."
3.0,"Really pretty necklace but the chain is very thin and broke the second time I wore it.  I can't see that I can link it back together but since it had two other lengths to connect it I can use one of those, although it makes it shorter than I would like.  If the chain would have held up, I would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,Cute bags but the picture is deceiving. Bags look to be different sizes but all 3 bags are the same size.
3.0,The band fits the gear fit 2 well and I did not have any issues getting it on. The problem is that I ordered the gray band and what I got is actually like a purple gray.
3.0,"Very nice, fit well!"
3.0,"I like this shirt. It's vintage and has a fabric that breathes well. The side seam ripped moments after putting it on. It was easily fixed, but still. The sewing job wasn't done very well. I don't know if i would recommend it, but cute buy if you think it's worth the money."
3.0,"Wore this to a wedding I went to recently. The edges felt like they were coming off constantly, and as soon as I began to sweat it felt like it came right off. I think this might have worked better if I didn’t sweat, but still."
3.0,L_XL size is very large.  Hopefully it will shrink a little after washing. Maybe I will try an M just to see if it fits better.
3.0,"It was huge on my daughter - from the picture, it looks smaller.  Should have been something else with the tutu to give it a scale for the size."
3.0,"I was excited about the green color shown on the picture but when i got the package the green was way different than expected. Other than that fit true to size, nice stretch. Good quality! 275 lbs 5'8''order a large since the XL was too big. it has nice length that can be worn with leggings. If you have big arms do not hesitate to buy because material will fit you nicely due to the excellent stretching. I have gotten a blue and a gray as well. Blue color is as pictured but gray is lighter than shown on the picture."
3.0,"Looks nice, it’s hard to put on."
3.0,"This was to replace an extremely well-made hat I purchased in Vietnam.  This one is rather delicate, as I was told by the store, and made for dressier occasions.  I would order a sturdier one next time that is made for people working outside."
3.0,Hard to fasten
3.0,"Give it a 3 star because the material quality seems nice, but the sizing was HUGE. I ordered my childs current size which was 12 months and he wont be able to wear it till he is probably 2. Its very big. So the sizing is not accurate."
3.0,"Doesn’t feet on me as it supposed to be according the picture. I’m 5.3, 134. Size S or 4. Looks like good quality but it Has weird cut :)"
3.0,I did not care for the material and fit of the jumpsuit.
3.0,"These tights fit me great and smooth my small postpartum pooch,  they're just a little long- I'm 5'2, 130lbs. BUT, I wore them only once and had a hole in the crotch by the end of the day! I can stitch the seam up again but sucks because otherwise, these pants fit like a dream. Not sure if my pair was defective but if it weren't for that hole, I'd give 5 stars."
3.0,Very thin fabric and runs a bit big. I don't think it was worth the price.
3.0,"I was really hoping I would love this, but it was just a bit too big on me. I really wish they made their clothes in different sizes - I love their style/design, but I'm only 5'2&#34; so most things swallow me up. Sadly I had to return, but it was an easy process so I would give 5 stars for that."
3.0,I returned. My girls (4 & 10) both thought looked too much like the Russian Minion hat in the last movie so didn't keep. I have a smaller head and it fit me fine so not sure if someone with a larger head or very thick hair would find too tight.<br />Definitely would not be mistaken for real fur which could be good or bad depending on the look you are going for.<br />Faster shipping than expected & easy return.
3.0,Seems like a very nice book with good liner however it is very short.
3.0,Overall comfortable yet fits too tight in waist area as compared to rest of the shorts. Material is soft and non toxic.
3.0,"it fits a little big and is cute, however it looks a lot shorter in the pictures than it is in real life. this dress went to mid shin for me and I am 5’5”. I decided not to keep it because I wanted something to hit me right above the knee, but it is great quality for the price."
3.0,I ordered this hat for my toddler and it was way too big. It also did not include the scarf feature which I was really looking forward to. I rated this 3 stars because of the size issue
3.0,"The hairs come off alot. I mean alot. You will need to vacuum every single moment. But, the product is pretty good and comfortable."
3.0,It is more pink the red. I wanted red so I was disappointed to see it was pink. It fits as expected. I don't ware it anymore because of the color. Even the printed images are light pink not white. That take away some of the cuteness of the whole shirt.
3.0,"It’s not a bad dress per say...<br />But I’m a 34 D, 5’4, 150 1bs. And I just didn’t feel it did anything for me. My mom thought it was cute but I wasn’t feeling it. It was a little tight at the top but a size up would’ve been too big. That type of dress yah know?<br />If you have an athletic and [] body shape as I describe mine probably not the best dress for you.<br /><br />Other than me not liking it for myself, the only other “compliant” I’d have is that the fabric wasted that comfortable."
3.0,"I was hoping the fabric was stretchy, the waist is but the fabric has no elasticity.  Also, I am a short person at 63 inches and they are just the right length."
3.0,Was a little disappointed with the fabric. It's a little stiff and itchy
3.0,"They were okay. Fit was fine, easy to put on, baby didn't seem restricted, but he is pretty hard on shoes and we do a lot outdoors. They scuff up pretty easy."
3.0,"This shirt looked so cute, and since I was throwing a mermaid 1st birthday party for my daughter I thought how perfect for me to wear.  I am glad I read the previous reviews because I sized up.  If you want it to be the slouchy sweatshirt look, size up. I went with a large and I usually go with a medium for a comfortable fit.  I got the baby blue sweatshirt (if you want to call it that) and it definitely does NOT have purple mermaid shells on it. They were dark blue.  I was bummed about that because the colors of my party were blue and purple.  The material is fairly thin...and not thick at all like a normal sweatshirt.  Regardless, I did wear the shirt as it did look cute on and I did receive quite a few compliments.  Also you can't beat the price or free shipping with amazon prime!"
3.0,"Fits fine but not that soft. Maybe after another few washes....,"
3.0,Super cute looking. They ran small in our experience and wouldn’t stay up on my daughter so we returned them.
3.0,The arms fit very tight
3.0,"This was shorter than expected.  I'm 5' 8"" and weigh 130 pounds.  I was hoping for a tunic length to wear with leggings, but it was too short for this purpose.  I had to return the shirt.<br /><br />Quality of fabric was ok, I did not wash so I'm not sure how it would hold up when laundered."
3.0,Looks nice but ?
3.0,advertised as an adult hat but its pretty small.  More like a child size
3.0,Had this ring for about 2 weeks and I do love it but 2 of the small green gems fell off and have no idea when lol.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:13977a716b1f48ebd9a83e8f6771dfc0]] I liked the the masks, just that they are very hard to keep on the face."
3.0,These glasses are very lightweight. They will be perfect for resort pool as I won’t worry about the polarization wearing off.
3.0,"So these are a real pain to adjust without 2 hands and a minute. I do not have that luxury because I have 3 boys , one being special needs . I intended to use these for him but I have a really hard time getting them on him because the way you adjust to fit is the wire looking metal thing and it keeps moving back to small as you try to place them on his head...... Sorry but just isn`t worth the effort it takes!<br />On a better note, if you`re using these on a non special needs person then I think you`ll be okay! It does lower the sounds around you and they are comfortable to wear."
3.0,"Within the first week, the pin that holds the fob to the ring fell out.  I had to make a new pin out of stainless wire and epoxy it in.<br /><br />For the price paid, I should not have had to do that.  I would expect that on a keychain that costs less than $5."
3.0,Even when I got this wet it didn’t really feel cool. I thought it might help me at work but it didn’t do anything. I got one in another brand that works better.
3.0,"The material, as others noted, is a very light jersey cotton. The colors are perfect. I’m 5’4” and 175lbs. I normally wear a L/XL, but sized up since people said it runs small. The XXL is actually quite large on me, which is fine, but I wouldn’t have purposefully brought it this large. The pockets, which were the big draw for me, stick out a bit awkwardly on my hips and are so small that my phone doesn’t even fit inside. Overall, it’s not a bad long sleeved tee shirt, but I wouldn’t expect it to be a warm sweatshirt or for the pockets to be functional. It honestly seems like the price point should have been closer to $10-12 rather than $18 for this product."
3.0,Nice but a size too big
3.0,"It was adorable, but bought it for a teenager and it was too small. It’s made for a baby or young toddler."
3.0,"Runs small and I don't know what's going on but there is something wrong with the shoulder area, it seems too wide or something, and I don't have narrow shoulders. No matter what I do, the kimono always falls off my shoulders and I have to keep pulling it up. I've never experienced this with my other kimonos."
3.0,The product was not neoprene at all. It came in damaged and it was very askew. And it came in with some dirt or something on it. The customer service to getting it fixed is impeccable and amazing. They are very fast at responding and very understanding and is doing what they can to fix it.
3.0,"I ordered these pants a size up because you never know how things will fit.  I wish I had ordered my normal size, because they are quite baggy.  They do not have a lot of stretch in them, and the legs are more like a bootcut than a skinny jean.  I'm probably going to return them."
3.0,"I read the measurements before I ordered, but I still didn't expect this top to be so loose and shapeless. I can gather handfuls of excess fabric on the sides. I do like how soft the fabric is. Also, the material is surprisingly heavy. This is not a thin lightweight shirt. It's also not sheer in the slightest, rare in a woman's blouse! I love the tie. It adds a bit of style and whimsy. Due to the excess fabric, I tried to tuck this top in. But because of the type of material, the fabric clung to me and I got a bit sweaty.<br />This isn't a bad top. But I didn't love it enough to keep it. I also got this top in red. I compared them and the red one is actually about an inch smaller in the waist. I'll be keeping that one."
3.0,Nice style and fits comfortably. But the material is thin and cheap looking. Good for casual wear.
3.0,i love the style it was too small!!
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress. The neckline is flattering, the waistline is flattering, and the slip inside isn’t too tight.<br /><br />But, I am disappointed, as I bought this dress because it was advertised as having pockets. Mine does not have pockets."
3.0,Made with questionable material on safety if used for jewelry and not big enough for key chains
3.0,It’s okay. I find light colored lint if I wear it over a darker shirt so that’s not great.
3.0,"I ordered a gray one but the one I got was a very shiny,  nickel,  almost chrome color. I was expecting something much darker."
3.0,"ReallyGreat gift. She loves it. The only thing is, the chain is a little bit small for supporting the weight of the crystal..."
3.0,Very juvenile colors not for the sophisticated-bohemian  kind of person.<br />Choice of color would make me happier to buy again!
3.0,"A little small, it was a gift and nos all good for my friend."
3.0,One of the silver earrings keeps unfastening. And they are hard to initially fasten.
3.0,Clasps break very easily.. but good deal for the quantity!
3.0,Fits WAYYY larger than expected
3.0,"I’m 5’9” and ordered a medium. Sweater is not fitted as shown in pic, more boxy. Arms were also very short. Material is decent!"
3.0,The leg part was a size large but the waist was SMALL! I couldn’t even get them past mid thighs to get them on. Unless you have a small waist don’t waste your money.
3.0,Too wide in the waist. Very thin.
3.0,"I love these, but they are not made very well. Mine came in the mail broken and I glued it back together. They are cheap and look very nice."
3.0,I like the message on the front of the mask. But the mask was too big and I gave it to my mom.
3.0,"I love the different designs of these slippers, and they're perfect for keeping socks on, and giving traction to a crawling, pulling-up baby, but they're a bit expensive, don't you think? TenderToes makes a similar product that is easier to wash and is much, much cheaper.<br />Also, beware of the sizes. I followed the month guidelines, and they're enormous."
3.0,The shirt fit perfectly; the pants on the other hand were large in the waist and baggy in the legs.
3.0,The product completely came undone at the seams when washing on delicate for the first time.
3.0,my 10 month son really had trouble walking with these shoes.. not recommended for first walkers.. best one are the ones from stride rite
3.0,"This razorback tank is super soft and looks awesome (though be warned - it is sheer). My problem? It's huge! I am 5'10&#34; & 160lbs with an F bra size and the large is far too big. The straps are really long and the shirt is baggy. I will have to undoubtedly return it for a medium, maybe even a small."
3.0,It’s cute and it does the job. It’s thin and not that soft though.
3.0,It's on the small size. Not for an adult.
3.0,"Super cute concept and it seems pretty decent quality so far. I ordered the rust and it definitely is “brighter” in person. If the color was more muted, these rompers would be much better."
3.0,The brim is sewn on a crooked to the hat but it fits great and isnt really noticable.
3.0,Look nice but was longer then what I expected.
3.0,Fit was as expected. They are a bit of a pain to charge. I do not think the remotes that came with ours work. But they made my son very happy.
3.0,"Cautiously recommend these, especially if you're not super curvy.<br /><br />These are better quality than I expected and very stretchy but sadly they didn't fit.  I've wanted some of the ""built-in thong"" look for awhile so decided to give these a try.  They're like a fishnet mesh legging with faux leather thong and booty-lifting accents.  I thought they looked fun and I could wear them to a concert or as part of a costume or something.  As you can see in my pic, however, they're too small for me.  I'm pretty, um, ample in the back so the accents hit my cheeks in the wrong spot and looked weird.  I normally wear size Large in all my leggings but tried the XL in these and still had to return them.  I'm almost 6 feet tall and pretty large, so if you're smaller they might actually work.  Anyway, I buy a lot of leggings on Amazon and love ridiculous shiny fierce things so thought I'd try these.  Ended up returning them because they just didn't fit me, but I cautiously recommend them if you're smaller than me.  If they're on Free Returns I say go for it, because if they fit right they're gonna look awesome and the mesh is higher quality than I was expecting.  You should probably go a size up.<br /><br />I don't get anything for writing this review.  I buy a lot of leggings on Amazon and am just trying to be helpful so you don't waste time or money with the same mistakes I make."
3.0,"Super super thin chain, but it looks nice"
3.0,I got the bracelet and I opened it and it was broken I got it in a good time which was a plus but the leather  piece was disconnected from the metal.
3.0,It's really nice but the shipping took really long
3.0,"I haven't worn it yet, but it is cute."
3.0,Watch is nice but in the long run it’s a quartz that’s over priced. The clasp makes the watch very hard to put on and take off.
3.0,"TOO SMALL, DIDN'T WORK FOR MY CIRCUMSTANCES"
3.0,"Love the style and comfort of this band, but it SNAGS fabric. It has ruined some of my favorite shirts. 😐"
3.0,the fit isn't great and they aren't very warm. seem to slid down in the back on me
3.0,Cute idea and love the off shoulder part but on me (I have rather large boobs and small waist) it looks like strange. The back is hanging off and shape is boxy. Maybe it is the chiffon fabric...delivery was waaaay ahead of schedule though.
3.0,"The fabric is great and the sewing is good, but a XL was like a American Small or Medium."
3.0,The charger piece inside shoe came broken had to search deep down inside the shoe to find it
3.0,This outfit was alright.  It fit way to small so I had to return it.  The plaid looked kinda Christmasy too so I don't think I'm going to get it in a bigger size.
3.0,Just A Little Small
3.0,Love the style and comfort but it’s too small even at an XXL (I’m a 38D). Going to return and order XXXL
3.0,Looks beautiful but easily broken.
3.0,"The color of the band is great, but the magnetic holder is not very strong."
3.0,These are pretty sheer and they fit snug.
3.0,"I like the mask , it's pretty cool looking but the filter pouch is awkward. it isn't big enough and I thin it should be stitched on three side. It keeps riding up out of position to cover you nose and mouth. great idea just needs handiwork on the design."
3.0,"Pretty dress, but runs about 2 sizes small."
3.0,I'm not crazy about the zippers. The inside one is broken.
3.0,I order larger than what I wear and it looks a little bit too big. The neckline is a little bit different that the picture. Still looks good but it is not exactly as what the picture shows
3.0,nice but long
3.0,"Super bulky, the shoes are overall cute, just not my style."
3.0,The charms are nice looking but if you're looking to match them up with Pandora similar charms you may not be happy - they are quite a lot bigger than Pandora charms and look awkward when they are put together.  They are also quite a bit lighter than Pandora .
3.0,"The description states it is ""all season"".  No, no, no it is not.  Absolutely it will make you too hot in warmer/sunny weather.  I wore it for the first time playing tennis in 70s temperature/sunny.  I seriously thought I was going to pass out from how hot I got in short amount of time.  I am in great shape and play tennis 6 days a week so it wasn't ""the body"" not used to the heat and I have a lot of experience/clothing to compare it to.  Love the shirt fit but it definitely is NOT for warm weather - unfortunately that is why I bought it.  Great as an undershirt on a cold morning.  Definitely follow the comments and order a larger size.  I am 5'2"" and maybe 110 lbs after a big dinner.  I bought a medium (never wore that size in my life) and was happy with the fit."
3.0,Pretty dress I would have kept it but it is see pretty much see through and as it is summer I didnt want to have to wear a slip underneath.
3.0,"These earrings are heavier (coarser) than the image showed. DOn't get them if you want something dainty. I just can't wear cuffs, so can't judge as to their worthiness, they seem pretty cheap. Good enough to keep and wear occasionally, but I wouldn't purchase them again."
3.0,Not a bad value but I have some issues with the quality. The nylon straps that adjust the shoulder strap length are pretty thin. The plastic piece that those straps loop through and anchor to that adjusts the length of the shoulder straps are also flimsy. On a couple occasions I have picked up the pack by a shoulder strap and the strap pulled completely out of the adjustment loop/anchor plastic piece. But it was pretty inexpensive so I guess the old adage of you get what you pay for holds true here.
3.0,"The product was too small, according to size this should be small and I need a large 🤬"
3.0,The skirt was very pretty but waist was much tighter than expected and it was too long for what I wanted .
3.0,"They look exactly like the photo. Large fits size 11. Material is a little light weight, therefore, the lower rating. Weight is similar to taking the material from a fabric and molding into a slipper. Was hoping for a more durable, heavy duty slipper. Shipping was as expected."
3.0,They worked for the time being but the glasses were literally just safety glasses and the headphones were not high quality at all
3.0,"I'm 5’2 147lbs (weight changes smh) I ordered a small and it fit as if it was 2 sizes too big. I gave the dress 3 stars because the dress was gorgeous, the material was nice, and the seller IS very kind and understanding"
3.0,I really love the style of this shirt but so disappointed in the cheap quality of It. I'm honestly afraid to wash this piece on delicate cycle. If they made this shirt with better material I'd give this 5 stars but all I can do is give it 3 stars and that's being generous. Also the fit is just weird.
3.0,"The photo shown with a girl's ear is very deceiving. When I opened the package and tried it on, it looked very short I don't have large ears. If I knew it was going to be that short, I wouldn't have bought it. The price was good, but quality isn't there. na"
3.0,Not keen on the metal zipper.... it really sticks out.
3.0,"Look good. Feel good. They are very warm and stylish... but, the inside smells really bad. I can't even describe it. After using them for a bit. My hands smell too. I don't use them anymore for that reason."
3.0,Beautiful but too small!  Seems durable so far. I don't like the ugly &#34;v&#34; on the front.  True navy blue.
3.0,"Just ok. It seems well made and feels nice, but the color isn’t true to photo which was disappointing. Definitely runs small, I ordered up a size and probably could’ve gone 2 sizes up to get that true oversized look. Also a bit longer than expected."
3.0,"how small the posts would be on these.  As if for a child.  I've been wanting a dove necklace for years and it was child sized as well.  I'm making them both work, though, as they are all beautiful, just munchkin sized. ;)"
3.0,"I'm 5'4"" 95 lbs. Finally thought I had joggers for a small person. They are huge everywhere but doable with fleece leggings underneath to run outside."
3.0,"I really like the idea of this zip up vest, but it's pretty big for a women's small. I felt it pretty baggy. I can tolerate it but just an FYI for anybody wondering about sizing. It's very comfortable though and seems pretty good quality, although the zipper has gotten stuck a few times. I don't think it's a bad deal for the price."
3.0,"It fit as expected but it was not flattering to my body.  Additionally, the color was a bit darker than I had assumed."
3.0,Purchased this for my little boy's party.  The kids loved them but too many arrived broken - about 5 or 6 pairs of glasses had broken legs.  I received them well in advance of his party and I didn't open them until the day of so couldn't send them back.  Those that were intact were well loved and received by the invitees.
3.0,Cute socks. Wore the first pair and they were perfect. The second pair I wore for one hour inside and a hole formed on the top by my toes. Very annoying.
3.0,"In the beginning, this dress is beautiful with vibrant colors and great for cooler weather as the fabric is thick and heavy.  However, after just two washes in cold water,  the dark blue has faded and the dress looks worn and older than it is."
3.0,"I love the rings, both style and fit. My main issue is that I after two days of wearing them, the rings stained my finger green.  I don’t wear them while washing my hands, or if my hands are wet but the green imprint remains present for several days after."
3.0,the sleeves were a little too long and definitely too large at the wrists.  I will try to buy this shirt again at a larger size.
3.0,Holds the dress out great.. The waist is too small. Has velcro and a string to tie around you. I can tie the string..but velcro busts open everytime. Someone did email me from the company to ask what size i would need. I said as long as it can fit a size 16 woman. They were very accomodating. But the product still didnt fit.
3.0,This is only getting three stars because the zipper is horrible. Otherwise it's a super cute dress and fits great!
3.0,It was decent but not good me
3.0,"This material is more of a spandex than cotton, so I don't love that.  It also fit a little large around the waist where the elastic band is. I  am 5'5&#34; 160lbs and ordered a M."
3.0,Held my braids but it would fall off Bc the band is not tight don’t know Bc my head was smaller or not
3.0,"The outfit was good enough for pics, not so much for a fam gathering at Easter. It lasted 5 mins being on and then was taken off, the straps in the back were way too long for a 2 month old. There was a lot of extra room after connecting them. It was still cute while it lasted."
3.0,"It looks really good but when I got this, couple of earings were broken. Quality was not too good. I had to use super glue to attach the pins back to the other peice."
3.0,Fits great just keep in mind the sleeve openenings are a bit small if I would order again I would go up a size.
3.0,Cute but wide
3.0,NOT MY FAVORITE
3.0,"the boot was fine, I just couldn't handle the height after a few hours."
3.0,"Cute shirt. But fit is little loose, so I wouldn’t size up.  The off the shoulder neckline is a little smaller/tighter that shown in the picture."
3.0,"I have several pairs of heels and they wear out quickly, so I was hoping for a lot. Unfortunately, they only fit ONE pair of my heels! It would be nice if they had different sizes or were adjustable, but alas. Don't expect too much. They're great on the one pair they do fit, though."
3.0,"thought they would be bigger, very small"
3.0,"Definately Great for anti glare, but, too dark for night vision.. Much better for day vision....."
3.0,It is too hard to adjust and close.
3.0,I have big calves so it was too tight. Other than that it’s a good sock for smaller legs.
3.0,"I thought it would have had more of a feminine cut, it seems like it's cut like a man's t-shirt"
3.0,"This shirt was a bit smaller than expected for fit and size.  The shirt has a very soft silky feel.  I will have to loose a few pounds to be able to wear this shirt comfortably.<br /><br />As long as you buy this product realizing the  fit is a bit smaller than sizing chart indicates, I would recommend buying this product."
3.0,"The underarm was too large, I had to return it."
3.0,"Not sure about these,  they definitely are not of the qualitie I am used to by this brand, and they are thinner also, I bought the black ones so I don't have any issue with them being see thru but I can definitely imagine some of the other colors having that problem.  With hat said they are still comfortable and I do wear them quite a bit.  Not sure if I would buy them again, I probably would because there fit is perfect but I would stick with the darker colors to avoid any issues with transparency"
3.0,I loved the socks because they are so cute but my daughter won't wear them because she says the bottom of the sock is uncomfortable. Giving it a 3 because I love them but she won't wear them.
3.0,"The fabric is little see through. I won’t wear out in public,  but have been wearing as a night gown. Comfortable to sleep in, I don’t get tangled up!  I may try in a darker fabric, so I could wear it out and about.  Seams are all sewn nice."
3.0,"Basically just a boob smoosher, with only moderate support."
3.0,Nice glasses but they fit really weird on the face. I think I expected them to be a bit wider than they actually were.
3.0,"I did not like the print and quality of the band, item was returned"
3.0,My Granddaughter likes it but she says the lace is itchy...
3.0,They run pretty small in size. Better suited for a child wearing a size10 or 11 little kid shoe.
3.0,cute top but way too big order your exact size
3.0,"This is a comfortable top, I ordered a bit larger hoping for length because I am tall, but still a bit short..."
3.0,They are ok just hope they hold up
3.0,"Bag is not 100% leather and does not have &#34;BIENNA&#34; on bag as depicted.  Keeping bag because it will suffice, but product description is misleading.  Ships from China, so be aware of that as well."
3.0,Me gusto el diseño y me queda perfect lo unico que no me parecio es el precio la tela no se mira fino para tener su precio tan alto
3.0,Got these as a gift for my friend. She loved them. They look as pictured.
3.0,"These are not a compression tank.  I read the reviews and ordered a size down.  They are too short for working out.  They were okay, but wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,"Not well fitting, it was comfortable. Wore it once and haven’t since."
3.0,"THE BELL SOUND IS BARELY AUDIBLE, PARTS KEEP COMING OF WITH JUST ONE WEAR, HAD TO TRASH IT"
3.0,"Ordered this for my wife (who is always a size small).  The elastic waist band does not &#34;hug&#34; around the waist, so we decided to return it.  Nice dress, nice material, great color ... but it simply did not fit her the way that the description and picture show.  Nice product, but just not what she was looking for."
3.0,Arms area was too roomy
3.0,Really cute & definitely made for small size toes. I wear a size 5 & they fit perfectly. Any bigger they might not feel fine.
3.0,I ordered a teal and navy band and got a black and navy one. I am going to be returning it. Other than this it seemed to be fine.
3.0,Most things run small now so this is in line with those. But the quality is why this gets 2 or 3 stars.  The side seams came apart in a handful of wears.  Not enough fabric allowance to re-sew together.  Love the graphics and colors though!
3.0,"This dress is darling and fit exactly as it should, but when I received it, there were some large openings in the knit. I had to wear it  because I didn't have time to send it back. That was disappointing, but it was a cute dress."
3.0,Runs very small...I saw a review that said so & ordered a size up but not even close!!
3.0,Cute bathing suit but the bottoms runs small
3.0,Hat is too small or my 5 years old has big head. Gloves are too big.
3.0,El material es muy suave
3.0,"Material is not for me. Its so shiny, it could almost pass as latex and almost feels like it. I typically wear size large and does run a tad big."
3.0,"Muy sencillo, solo se ve lindo en foto..."
3.0,Cute. Have the other colors and love this suit. Color is pretty but you can see the black bottoms through it
3.0,"Fits shorter than expected, could be my height but it barely covers swimsuit bottom"
3.0,"The band itself seems very well made and very nicely finished.  However, I did not see myself going to the major work to resize it.  I do not have the tools necessary to cut or grind the mesh links.  So I returned it."
3.0,"Love the saying, wish it was better quality."
3.0,I was a bit disappointed in the length of the shirt. It was a bit too short ~ but I do like the fit.<br />Thanks ~
3.0,"Great bra, but underwire in front is uncomfortable.  Would like same bra without the underwire.  Can wear for short time."
3.0,Good for its price.  It's a little bit too big.
3.0,A bit bigger and thicker than i expected.  Id say the are 12mm. Maybe 14. The are not heavy but you do feel them if you shake your head. I was looking for a smaller earring but these are ok. They are pretty.
3.0,Shirt fits snug and is short in length
3.0,"I ordered a size large but received an extra-large.  Glad I did because the pajamas ran rather small so I was satisfied...that is until I washed and dried them for the first time.  Much to my dismay, the pajamas shrunk considerably and now are a tad on the small size.  (I guess that is why they send the extra large.  lol"
3.0,"The color is VERY vibrant orange , i thought it would be a soft amber tone but it did fit ok, I do think it is overpriced. The other colors are most likely better."
3.0,"Love the hat.  Good quality, but head band is just some thread with a beaded something attached.  Needs a better head band."
3.0,Loved the fit but I was not a fan of the floral in person. I think it looked too 90s
3.0,Not very long
3.0,Very comfy!! I got a medium. But next time I’ll get a small.
3.0,"We got these as a Christmas gift for my daughter but had to return them. These shoes are cute, simple and elegant. Great price for all leather. But the shape of the toe box means these run small. I suggest you order a half size larger to keep little feet from being pinched."
3.0,Bust is way too revealing. I am 36D medium.
3.0,This is a cute backpack.  On the smaller side and not quite as vibrant as in the picture.  Still a good buy for the $!
3.0,The leather is nice and thick and seems legit. The pendant is nice and hefty. The beads could be way better; I actually took them off. They feel like plastic.
3.0,Picked this out for Christmas. In my opinion the fit is pretty snug and tight when I wear it. It does ship flat but it opens fully up and after a couple of wears it doesn't really remain flat.  the quality is decent but due to the snug fit I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"Necklace came with a broken clasp. I haven't received a replacement yet. The medal looked fine, but the chain could't be opened to put on."
3.0,Bracelets fell apart the first day we wore them.
3.0,Not exactly what I expected looking at the picture but not bad for the price. If it came with a  better leather band it would have been perfect. The band it comes with and the 2 extra bands are all cheap bands. I am going to invest in good watch band and then I will have a good watch.
3.0,Not as expected for that size. Bought a size up and the fit is very tight.
3.0,"These socks don't have a clean, finished edge at the top. They are already loosely knit and I fear they will easily ravel."
3.0,"This turtleneck is sooo long!! Being short (5'1), I expect this occasionally, but this hits me mid-thigh... I am going to keep it because I like the material (minus three small snags) and have decided to pair width leggings and an oversized cardigan. Every day turtleneck? No.... nice wardrobe addition? Yes"
3.0,Image looks better then it is in realty Plus size is too large. Not worth money
3.0,"This was a decent, summer dress however I was looking for something a little more classy and for evening wear. The slip under this dress is very thin and short. A little too juvenile for me but not bad. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"These ear muffs don't really cover my ears as much as I would like so if I wear them this coming winter it will probably be over a toboggan.  They don't seem to be adjustable either.  They are cute, soft and furry looking but they just don't cover my ears well at all."
3.0,"Bought it for my dad for Christmas, He loves his Ram truck. The cap was extremely over priced."
3.0,HUGE. I ordered the 0-12 months and they fit my friend's 2 year old. I guess I'll just have to wait a year till they fit my kiddo :/
3.0,Had to return did not fit. Quite smAll.
3.0,"I do absolutely love this purse! However Ive had it about 3 months and the cross body strap is tearing away from the purse on both sides. I can still use it with the short handles, thats just not what I like. Sadly I will probably stop using once it breaks for good, maybe another month."
3.0,Hood is too small for head. Jacket is made with costume like fabric. Looks cool though.
3.0,"The print is really cool and the glasses would have been great, had they not been really crooked. When I attempted to bend them to fit my face properly (trust me, my face isn't crooked), they bent so easily that they couldn't be bent into an acceptable shape. One twist, and they were forever ruined. I may have just got a bad pair."
3.0,I ordered a wide but they are still a little snug. Gets better with frequent wear
3.0,Fits a little small. Would recommend one size up. Overall not a bad shirt
3.0,"I got this for my wife for Christmas. ""Generally,"" she likes it but does say that it is tight in the sleeves. No, I wouldn't say that she has unusually large arms; it's just tight..."
3.0,I said this was too small but what I really wanted to say is it’s too short. I have to wear it with leggings and I am only 5’2
3.0,"Purchased this costume for Halloween, but was disappointed for a few reasons: 1) no chopsticks were included as depicted on the item, 2) the flap above the head did not stay up and needed to be secured, 3) there was an awful manufactured odor that did not dissipate even after 4-5 days of laying out.<br /><br />The fit is one size fits all and it fit me pretty well being a 6ft, 200lb man. Though a bit large, it also did fit my wife who is 5ft tall. This is a versatile costume with a few flaws that if addressed could make it a solid outfit for any dress up occasion."
3.0,Spacious and more of a work bag. Not a true red and inside has a slight fishy odor. Im going to zip a dryer sheet inside to see if that helps.
3.0,Definitely runs small but very cute. I recommend sizing up at least 1 size if not 2. The sleeves of the shirt are the tightest and it's a bit short.
3.0,"The dress fit fine. Material is heavy, so that’s great for cooler weather. Once, one I felt the dress was a bit more matronly, maybe it’s the mossy green only. Looks cuter on others. I’m 5’11” 225lbs, normally I wear a xl, in this I ordered according to other reviews and went with xxl, it was a good fit."
3.0,"I got a lot of compliments at work, but I wore a black shirt underneath it and before I even got to work my arms were covered in fuzz.  I did wear it right out of the box.  I will wash it and see if it does any better.  Beware if you do the same thing I did!  It was very comfortable and easy to work at my desk.  Not cumbersome and it kept me warm all day.  I even got a little hot at times."
3.0,Bought it for my husband.  It was really to small. Other than that it was nice.  If I could have gotten a larger one would have ordered it.
3.0,A little thinley made .Runs very small.Not soft
3.0,Sleeves are way too small for the size of the blouse.
3.0,"At first I really like how the mesh hat allowed the breeze to fly through and the heat escape from my head.  However, it does not absorb any sweat at all, including the bill of the hat, which is made of plastic.  When jogging, I didn't realize how much sweat a normal ball cap or visor absorbed; with this hat, sweat was literally dripping off the bill of the hat."
3.0,"This shirt does not look at all like the picture, neither in color nor style--the sides of the shirt are equal length, and is reminiscent of a lampshade cover.  It is, though, very soft - I'm keeping it as a pajama top."
3.0,They were kinda small around my wrist and arm
3.0,Its cute but it run small and I am a medium. But there isn't a lined so everyone will be able to see your pubic hairs and nipples
3.0,These are comfortable I will say that. The body is tight while the arms are a little baggy though. My biggest disappointment is that I bought this pack for the green and it’s not even green. It’s more like grayish/stormy blue:(. The other 2 colors came as pictured.
3.0,"I ordered this for my Mom so she would not have to dig in her purse for her phone plus the clasp is so much easier to open than a zipper with arthritis. The ""white"" color I ordered is NOTHING white. It is a dark taupe. Nice product but very inconsistent with color description."
3.0,It was a little big on top for her
3.0,"Ordered a 5/6 and it's a bit short. More like tunic length. It also had a couple loose threads when it came to us. That being said, the material is nice and thick and the colors are great. It fits my kid nicely and she loves it."
3.0,The dress is very comfortable and colorful.  The pockets are a plus.  Splits are high on both sides.  Easy to wash and just hang dry.
3.0,After reading a previous review that stated cap kept the chlorine out of hair I assumed swimcap was waterproof...which it is not. Sadly disappointed since I was mainly looking for a waterproof swimcap. The rest of the set looks like a good value for the price but haven't tested the items.
3.0,A little small- shes hasn't tried it yet.
3.0,"The untucket shirt loves its wrinkles.  My fault in that I didn’t read closely the content of the material.  Nylon not cotton.  One that probably can’t be winter worn.  Very light material.  Oh, well, guess there is always spring and summer but winter colors."
3.0,Go a size bigger
3.0,Not for going to the beach. Be careful with your eyes.
3.0,"The olive color was a bit more murky than I cared for. This is also a turtle neck shirt, not a sweater. Its about as thick as a normal polyester ribbed shirt. The neck opening has no stretch,  so it kinda scratches your face when you try to put it on, and because it's tighter there, it kinda puckers at your neck.<br />Overall, not a fan. Runs true to size if not slightly large. I had ordered up because I saw the slim fit in the description and probably could have just gotten my normal size. I got the xl and im 5 10, 185 and a 36dd.<br />Hope this helped"
3.0,"These are ok.  Very cheap but they seem pretty strong.  The problem I have is that they seem very big.  I just got an actual pair of ray-ban wayfarers and these are much bigger, at least the height of the lenses are.  And I am pretty sure they are not polarized.  I got my girlfriend a pair of the tortoise shell ones and they seem to be polarized."
3.0,"The graphic looks good (as pictured) but it’s a low quality sweatshirt - thin, with a rough texture. Fortunately, it’s not something I expect to wear very often. Would not buy again.<br /><br />It did arrive a couple of weeks early, so that was a plus."
3.0,The batteries do not last as long as description stated
3.0,"Cute, but a little small, and also had a heavy chemical smell be washing."
3.0,Love the style but do not desire to by from China.
3.0,The shirt is cute but it’s short. I suggest ordering a size up.
3.0,"I usually love the fit of Not Rated boots, but there’s no support in these boots."
3.0,"Gorgeous jumpsuit, and looked like the image. I am 5'9 160. I ordered a Large and it was too big so I returned it."
3.0,Cute but I ordered a brown hamster not a grey one.
3.0,Cute rings just what they were suppose to be and I got them pretty quickly
3.0,The shirt is ok. I bought a medium and it’s bigger than I like. I’m 5’7” and 138 lbs.  I also thought the collar is too big and the buttons feel a little basic. It’s a good white shirt but it’s not great.
3.0,Cute but the pants are huge!
3.0,"Got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and the necklace its self is to short, it chokes her , otherwise nice necklace"
3.0,Cheap material. Scratchy almost like a cheap Halloween costume. Still wore it cause I had no time to get a replacement. The fit was good and I got compliments.
3.0,Looks good for super skinny people. ☹️
3.0,Cute dress although I thought the background was black but it's really navy but that was fine. I had to return it because it was so small. Not sure what I was thinking when I ordered a Medium. I probably could have used an XL. But that's not the dress's fault.
3.0,"A little uncomfortable, but hay, look at the price."
3.0,fabric has a weird sort of cotton feel that is easily snagged however the colors are terrific
3.0,"Love the pants, however when paying $50 for a pair of jeans I would have expected that there would be a hole for the button and a tag on the inside stating size and care instructions. As it was I had to cut my own hole for the button and the tag appears to have been cut off of the inside of the jeans. Not sure they are worth $50.00..."
3.0,Seem to already be bent and very cheaply made. I just hope they survive the weekend. Look good on
3.0,"This product looks like it does in the photos. However, the material is very cheap and feels almost like the inside of a swimsuit."
3.0,Very difficult to attach clip on to glasses frame.
3.0,The C Pink color is now where close to the online photos but a very bright baby pink. Ordered M. Can wear with leggings and it’s long enough. There’s no collar tag which is nice since some can be irritating.
3.0,"I absolutely loved these earrings when I received them.  Unfortunately, I thought they were gold plated, and after just a few weeks of wearing them my ears got so itchy and I actually started to break out from wearing them..."
3.0,"It must be said, this is the winner .. and if cost is no issue, stop right here.. these are the ones.<br /><br />However, i thought these were pricey when they were originally introduced at $3.25/diaper.. now they are $4.50/diaper. i am sure some will still buy them for the novelty, but this price is not practical for real world use.<br /><br />Jumped the Shark."
3.0,"Not at all what I was expecting with these 5 star reviews. Fabric is not as stretchy. Skirt fell apart after one wash. Top half extremely faded. Wash instructions (wash seperately. Professional dry clean recommended) that’s it.  Fit large on the arm and my daughter is on the larger/ taller scale for her age. Luckily for me, I purchased as an ugly “sweater” dress. So this will do the trick but I’m still upset I paid more than 10 for this thing."
3.0,"Not the perfect thing I expected, Its a good product but the quality is not, blue leather have some fading and scratches."
3.0,Lights stopped working after one week
3.0,Cool and comfortable. Love the print but it does not match up at the seam I. The back. Cute summer casual dress.
3.0,Not the best quality. The photo was lifted from a ThreeDots ad.
3.0,"Really cute looking, but feels more like neoprene or scuba material.  Thin, itchy, spongey, but still looks cute!"
3.0,"Good ring, just wish it was sized and not adjustable. I don’t wear it as much because it pinches my finger, size 7."
3.0,These are very thick and makes me hot. I feel like I can't breath because they are very thick compa6to other N95 I have used before. They definitely protect you with a good seal.
3.0,"My wife chose this top hoping it would be a good staple in her professional wardrobe. Unfortunately, the fit just isn’t great. Her are her thoughts on the blouse:<br /><br />On the positive side, the blouse seems well made. It held up just fine in the wash on the gentle cycle, and the full front and back are fully lined. The pattern and texture add fun, fashionable details and, in white, it can be worn with jeans, bright pants, skirts, etc.<br /><br />The problem is the fit. I ordered a large based on the size chart and my typical size. The top fits, technically, but feels tight around the shoulders. If you’re curvy, the top hangs straight from the bust creating a boxy shape. Needing the large for my broad shoulders, the V-neck hung lower than I prefer.<br />The bottom hem of the top feels weirdly constricting. I think the design would be improved if it had a slit on each side at the bottom as many similar tops do. Overall, it’s a cute top for a certain body type. I’m sure I’ll still find occasion to wear it, but it won’t be the go-to staple piece I’d hoped to find.<br /><br />The pricing on these blouses is crazy. Depending on the size, color and cut, these ranged in price from $9.99 - $24.86 at the time of this review. I think the pricing should be more uniform."
3.0,"Product was accurate in size (I’m 5’6” and 130 and got a medium). I loved the bottoms and they fit great, but the top had some issues. First, the padding that came in the top was lumpy. I tried taking it out and flattening it, but it continued to have a weird lump right in the middle. I ended up just using padding from a different suit. The top also rolled down on the top while I wore it as strapless, so the white liner on the inside was constantly rolling out the top and I was constantly pulling the suit up."
3.0,"Photo is chocolate  brown corduroy with blue and white strip pockets, which is what we ordered. What we got was a tan corduroy with green and white strip pockets.<br /><br />We didn't bother putting them on our toddler because they seemed very big.<br /><br />Looked well put together though."
3.0,"Good fit and appearance, but the material seems to pick up lint & cat hairs."
3.0,This shoe runs small. It was too short and too snug. Just not right fit for my feet. I had to return. I do love Easy Spirit shoes just not this particular style.
3.0,plating wore off within a week of wearing.
3.0,"I got a large based on the sizing chart, should have gone for an XL or even XXL as these run really, really  small. Other than that they appear to be really well made and feel like they would be really warm. Gonna gift these and reorder a larger size for myself."
3.0,"It is VERY pale green, almost imperceptible. I expected some color to show. Also it came in a baggie instead of nicely displayed in a fine jewelry box"
3.0,"I am 5'11 and wear a US size 10. I bought this in a 5xl and it is still a little snug over my chest. However, it is really warm and cute- I still wear it around my office to keep warm."
3.0,"Super thin and practically see thru.<br />The colors are also way more muddy pastel, there is nothing vivid about this top at all .<br />Disappointed it didn’t look like the selected image<br />The fit was lose and roomy but it was also very boxy feeling."
3.0,La tela no es muy resistente
3.0,"The material too thing, do not spect support. A little larger than expected"
3.0,I really do like them for working out they keep you nice and cool
3.0,"The ear seemed like they were made for a child's head, rather than an adults- which is what it's advertised for. There wasn't really any way to put the tail on. There was just a stretchy loop at the end of the tail; I guess you could safty pin it?"
3.0,They’re attractive and I liked the spinner wheels but they were smaller than expected. The middle bag could almost pass for a carryon. The zipper on the largest broke in the first international flight.
3.0,May be because it's just plastic or the product itself but the ball barely stays on
3.0,"Overall it’s a cute dress. The top fits a bit big, and the bottom fits true to size. Since it is one piece, it is a bit irregular in the fit."
3.0,The dress is cute when you put it on but the material is terribly cheap. You can see that it is poorly made just looking at the stitching.
3.0,The strap works for the most part but gets shrunk or stretched easily and starts to slip off.
3.0,Great as a one time costume piece. Used for Halloween.
3.0,After a while Velcro wouldn’t work to close
3.0,"Great, but after being used for a few months started to fall apart. Sad, because I loved it so much. It fit my Samsung S9 plus."
3.0,ok item and are really cute but the eventually they get all bleck
3.0,"For the price the dress is fine, although shorter than expected. I am 5'8 and the dress is above my ankle"
3.0,The set is much smaller than I expected. The most disappointing part was the tail...it's actually smaller then my actual cat's tail so doesn't really stand out for a human.
3.0,It was pretty BUT the quality was just not there<br />Pretty deceptive!
3.0,I LOVE THE WAY THEY LOOK BUT ORDER UP A SIZE NARROW AND TIGHT
3.0,Tunic fit as expected. Trim area was a little tight.
3.0,Material was gross. Got here on time which was nice but it had a smell to it and was too small. I ordered a large but it fit like a medium
3.0,"So this dress is really cute.  BUT, I purchased both the small and medium because I thought maybe I had the wrong size, because the top does not lay flat across the chest.  It's an imperfection in the design. Because of that, I didn't feel like I could wear it as a dress.  I do wear it as a nightgown though. It would be ok for a bathing suit cover. really is cute, but just didn't well, even after ironing."
3.0,Granddaughter loved them but they run small.  My problem  with them is they get so dirty.
3.0,I don't think they realize that when you put it on the material stretches n the image is hidden in your neck
3.0,"It’s Ok nothing special, it’s a similar Tiffany Dupe but not passable as one tho because you can tell it’s not real silver. It’s nice if you’re not trying to copy the Tiffany bracelet."
3.0,Very clear.
3.0,Wallet is good quality.  Versatile and sturdy.  Larger than I anticipated!  I lose my wallet frequently so the size should help curtail that in addition to the chain.  No thoughts on the chain - I had already ordered a different one prior to purchasing.
3.0,"I like theses earrings, but they didn't come in separate sized bags so I had to figure out what size they were"
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress.  I'm 5'4&#34;, about 133 lbs, and wear a 34c.  The dress has a nice weight to it, and is very soft and comfortable.  However the seam was split right out of the package and the medium was so large from the bust down that it looked like maternity wear in my opinion.  I might return it for a small, but I'm hesitant to do so given the ripped seam.  Seems like it's not made very well if that can happen before it's even been worn or laundered."
3.0,Realmente no creo q sea de piedras reales
3.0,"Ordered 2 of these dresses, one with sunflowers and one in the wine red color. The sunflower dress is very nice and made well, it feels like a cotton material. However, the red one is a totally different fabric and is very thin/see through and wrinkles."
3.0,Great prize and works for what it was intended but quality is so so. Waistband gets tangled a lot. Bouggt it for my 4 year old and it fits perfect.
3.0,"The shirt was perfect, tutu is garbage."
3.0,"Pretty. Only problem is that it was advertised as 108 bead mala, and there are only 104 beads."
3.0,I wasn't able to zip and coat comfortably.
3.0,The ends where then band meets is jagged.
3.0,"The dress was pretty but the straps are really elastic. If you're between sizes, definitely size down."
3.0,Faded first time it was washed.
3.0,"the cup area is very constrictive, and took a few washes to be comfortable."
3.0,"I ordered a large ... It's huge . And I'm not a little girl . I'm 5'8 and about 180lbs. My biggest complaint however, is it's short ... It doesn't cover my stomach."
3.0,Don't iron it!  It will melt!
3.0,"It's a nice watch if you have wrists as big as a man.nicely made good looking watch,but just too big for the average woman's wrists.actually this particular watch would be a good man's watch.the style is unisex.So I guess I will give this watch to one of my guy friends.oh well."
3.0,"As the previous reviewer mentioned... it was not what I expected from a Travelon bag.  I too noticed what appeared to be the zipper locking clip was on the wrong side of the bag.  I called Travelon's customer service and they told me this bag was made specifically for QVC... so could be why the quality is a bit different.  I'm waiting for them to call me back and let me know if it's for a different purpose or just decorative.<br /><br />Unfortunately the threading was coming apart on the inside lining, however this allowed me to see the inside materials of the bag.  I was a bit shocked to see white plastic foam-like material was used to line the inside of the bag.  It's like the thin foamy cushy shipping material used to wrap fragile objects.  It's nice that it adds a bit of cushiness to the bag, but so odd!  Maybe it's part of their water repellant claim?  Definitely won't soak through to your stuff in there.  The polyester material does feel pretty sturdy, but not the same slash proof material I am seeing on other Travelon bags.  The netting on the side pocket is pretty flimsy and already gets stuck in the zipper.<br /><br />The style and size of the bag is perfect for what I'm looking for, but I'm contemplating on exchanging for a new one or just returning it.  That inner material bugs me for some reason."
3.0,"it was cute, but the seem in the pants was completely off, and already had a big hole in the middle of the pants when I received it. Also the neckline in the short seems to be very stretched out"
3.0,"I really like the look and comfort of this stretchy band. Unfortunately, it has stretched out a good bit since I purchased it and the edges are turning wavy. I don’t use it during workouts so it’s not a huge deal but now the band is also staring to unravel where it was sewn together. Definitely disappointed in the quality of this band."
3.0,I purchased black one and white one.  Black fits very nice and hangs perfectly. Fabric is soft and comfy.  White was cut smaller and feels tighter on chest and under arms. Maybe more cotton in white.
3.0,"I tried purchasing 2 different sizes in these but ultimately the straps are just too long on my daughter even if the rest fits perfectly. I had to hand stitch the straps to be shorter so she isn't ""falling out"" in class. She's 12 and needs a better fit than this. Don't recommend."
3.0,I love the way it fits I love the length I love the pockets but the material is just not as cool as I thought it would be. It actually makes me feel a little bit stuffy. But other than that it's a great product I thought I could wear it as a summer dress in Florida but it just makes me sweat more. I'll just have to use it when the weather is a little cooler
3.0,The size is to large. Shirt seems to be double the size. Pants seem right size shirt is huge
3.0,It comes small so order a size bigger
3.0,Looked pretty in the picture—looks pretty cheap in person.
3.0,I'm 6 and a half feet tall with a big head. An these don't fit my head great. Sorta hurt around the nose and earpieces.
3.0,So when i first put this on my watch i loved it it looks really elegant and goes great when I am wanting to wear it with jewelry. The problem occurred when i was trying switch it out. for some reason maybe my error i'm not sure but the second piece didn't have the push down thing to remove it. I did have to end up breaking it off . So just be aware when switching the bands that it does have easy removal option . Did love the look of it too bad its broken now.
3.0,It's a nice lightweight backpack and serves its purpose but did not come with the first aide kit as advertised.
3.0,"Followed sizing, even going up a size. Had to return, however, based on the material it appeared to be a great product."
3.0,"Decent, low cost product"
3.0,I like the coat - but it really tight in the mid section. Make sure you a skinny!
3.0,"The shirt design is great, and the width is fine, but it is a bit too short.  I will layer with another tank top underneath, but a bigger size would be too baggy across chest."
3.0,Looks good but not comfortable. After washed it shrinks two sizes. Wouldn’t recommend
3.0,My boobs are too big to fit this dress
3.0,The gauge is thick for my tiny holes. I had to oil my ears to put them on but I like them despite the pain
3.0,These were not what I expected. They are very lightweight and have a texture similar to a windbreaker jacket. I found that unpleasant so I sent them back.<br />As for the fit: I measured myself and ordered according to the size chart. They fit around the hips vut were enormous at the waist.
3.0,Go one size up if you;re not thin.
3.0,It wasn’t as cute in person as in the picture. It is also very large and baggy on me and I bought a small
3.0,I don't consider my ears large by an means but these were very small.  Almost like they were designed for children.
3.0,Not as long as I would have liked for them to be but at least they came in the color I actually ordered instead of the two previous sets that I had to return.
3.0,Think the neck piece is dangerous to a toddler.<br />Cut mine down to a headband with flower.
3.0,"I've been wearing sunglasses over my prescription glasses for about 2 decades, less 2 or 3 years. Honestly the Kmart in town used to carry a nice selection of ""Sundowners"" & another brand. They came in 3 sizes depending upon the size of your glasses.<br />Our Kmart closed down and is still empty. There's no other place in town to get them. Thus of course, as in all things, I checked Amazon.<br />I found these great matte leopard like sunglasses 😎 on there and ordered them as a Christmas gift my son could give me.<br />They look very cool although perhaps I should have gotten the glossy ones, but they felt great over my glasses. Everything was great... inside. Then I went out on a sunny day and immediately felt blinded by the sun. These lenses should be darker as my other ones were. And the lenses should not have to be black or grey to do it. I've always bought brown ones as it's a better color for redheads.<br />There is no excuse for this. These sharp sunglasses need to work better. I really hope the makers actually do something to fix that. I can't imagine it's too hard. Again I shouldn't have to buy a black or grey set to get darker lenses, although I really don't know if they would be.<br />I'm keeping them because otherwise I have nothing as my other ones finally broke after about 15+ years."
3.0,"I thought these would look a little more shiny, but these just look sooooo cheaply made. But you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"I like the way the shirt was made and it looks like a cool concept BUT it looks like glue or something got spilled over it... i know it’s part of the design, but in the light it looks like maybe too much glue was applied. Came a little small. Maybe I got one with a bit too much glue? I love the thumb holes and shoelace shoulders and the hood is cool... except those spots. Looks a bit discolored in the light. Not too sure what to think of this.."
3.0,"Comfy and real nice, but the pockets are really small and ripped open within two days"
3.0,I purchased before summer 22… and I’m now wearing in Nov … the fit and feel is perfect. However the battery started smoking when I tried to charge it. Is there anyway to get a replacement battery?
3.0,"This is an alright necklace for a child. I mainly got it because of the rotating parts--it makes for a really nice fidget toy, and I can sit there spinning the necklace silently while working on other things. But it definitely looks cheap, and would be pretty out of place on an adult wearer. The clasp is super easy--it's just a stick-through-a-hole type clasp, which feels like if it weren't so large you'd notice if you lost it, this necklace would be SUPER easy to lose."
3.0,I saw other reviews to size up so I did which was the right choice. It is made from very comfortable soft material and removable pads. But the straps aren’t adjustable and there’s not much support if you wanted to exercise in them. But overall not bad quality.
3.0,I bought the red bag and am disappointed in the color. Definitely not as pictured. The color is faded out and is closer to a rust red. Looks almost pink or orange in certain lights.
3.0,nice belt nice looking BUT!!!!! very  difficult to undo  to take it off
3.0,Three stars because it makes me look flat chest
3.0,"Got it and lasted about 6-7 months. It's made out of a thin rope kind of material and started to wear out after putting it on and off. Was taken off before swimming, showering, and not wet while washing hands. Otherwise, it would have worn out quicker. I like it but just not thick enough and doesn't last very long."
3.0,The material was see through too
3.0,"Nice design and color, but material is thin and does not feel like a quality flannel shirt."
3.0,"Chosin Face Bandana with arm protectors was returned unfortunately... Not as described, too small/short. I wanted a loose black mask which also covers my neck. Took it out of the plastic bag, could visually see that this did not appear as in the picture on the model. I didn't try it on as it was obvious, too small/short.<br /><br />That being said, I have a small head, face and shorter neck than most. I fit in/wear children's sized hats!! This item runs too small. Sleeve protectors would have fit, but I bought this to have a black mask."
3.0,"For the price, I got what I deserved.  It's a bit chintzy and most likely will only wear when working in the yard. Oh well, I tried."
3.0,"fast delivery. However, kind of thin and waste band pulls easily - concerned they may tear."
3.0,"The light bulbs (i guess) come out very easily so I have had to tighten them back on after already losing a couple of them.  But if/when the lights give out, it is still a nice patio umbrella."
3.0,Cute outfit. Very thin. Good for the summer.
3.0,Light cardigan that looks like a blazer. Great for fall office-wear. I love the stripes but the fit wasn't right for me. I'm 5'-4 1/2&#34; and 130 lbs - I ordered a medium and the small metal hook and eye clasp in front never stays connected. This might be solved by smaller size or a breast augmentation. ;) I'm not sure I love it that much to try to return and reorder. I'll probably end up thrifting it.
3.0,It looks better from the back then the front. Seems like it's too much material in the front. The skirt underneath is super short. I like short skirts so it was ok with me. Haven't worn it out. Only tried it on.
3.0,Very cute but backs are really small and fell off I had to put different back on.
3.0,Thought the quality of the fabric could have been much better.
3.0,"OK watch for the price, since it is super cheap. But, do not expect a high quality watch. The gold on the sides of the watch started to peel off after wearing it just a couple of days. The strap can easily detach from the watch face. Like I said, I gave it three stars because it is such a cheap watch and I did not expect it to be that great."
3.0,"Nice dress but it is see-through. You can see even my belly button , Can’t as it were it in public."
3.0,Runs REALLY small. I ordered a large because i like baggy jackets and it fits like a small jacket would. I’m 5’7” and 125lbs. Pretty comfy but not the material i was expecting
3.0,"The band's arrived as they were expected. However you pay $5 for shipping and it took over 3 weeks to arrive. Seemed excessive, but the product is as advertised."
3.0,Design seems a bit tall on my face. They need to be a bit more streamlined.
3.0,Bought to use with my daughters formal dress. I ended up taking pieces off so it wasn't so costume. It was not bad for the money.
3.0,This is my second pair of air wair boots. I love my older pair. This boot is very stiff and uncomfortable around the ankle since it doesn’t give.
3.0,"I had to return these because I had been sick and lost like 10 pounds. Nice pants. So soft. If I would have kept them, I would have been disappointed in the cut...very flared."
3.0,Fabric and colors are less than desired but for the price was a good buy
3.0,Muy brilloso y un poco grandes
3.0,"I really liked the color of this dress and quality of the make/material. The heart buttons are super cute and the length of the dress is definitely in the 50s fashion which is what I loved about it. What I didn't like is that the belt was too long and the arm holes are small- it feels like my arms will lose blood circulation (and I don't have abnormally &#34;large&#34; arms). The dress is a very heavy material which I liked because I don't like feeling like people can see through it and the overall quality was done well- the seams and stitching etc were very consistent. Be prepared to iron this dress and probably will need a good ironing after every wash- and don't dry it. The part I dislike the most is that the buttons over my chest area feel like they will pop off. I typically wear a size 12 or large in dresses (175 pounds, 5'2, 38C) I do not have a larger bust area and can't imagine that women that do would be comfortable in the chest area with this dress. I really wanted to love this dress but did not feel as comfortable as I wanted to."
3.0,"I ordered three sets of these. The shipment was split- two came from the east coast, one from the West. Only one set was lined the other two were not. Ironically the three lined hats were part of the shipment of six not the ones that came separately. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Nice hats either way, but who knows what your going to get. Now I have to decide which of my students get lined hats and which do not. 😔"
3.0,Thin is the best way to describe the material.  But that's what I was expecting.
3.0,"These shoes are adorable and fit well. Love the idea, but my daughter immediately and easily pulled both bows off and there is no way to put it back on. Now she just has shoes with no bows, which pretty much defeats the purpose of Minnie Mouse shoes."
3.0,"I  very much like the pendant but was very disappointed that it displayed French writing on it in the picture but when I received it , it was in English.  I specifically sent an email stating that I wanted the item as pictured with French writing."
3.0,"Overall, I think this is a great product... for smaller chests. I wear a 42 DDD and the bra does a good job at pushing your breasts together but lifting, nope, not for bigger chests.<br />Customer service is amazing though. My package got lost somewhere so they fast shipped another one me for free. Would recommend for smaller chests."
3.0,Not flattering on my body type. Under the arms were way too big.
3.0,"It's really pretty but the only bad part is it turns black, once it get wet."
3.0,"As the price would indicate it's cheap and cheerful, so I didn't expect too much. However on arrival both zippers were not functioning well, and one of the clasps on the front would not stay closed. The purse was cute but I decided to return."
3.0,"Ehhh.. Its pretty at first, buts its smaller than I expected and its got a big of a narrow opening... It can be hard to find things in your purse because you can't open it up wide enough to see in it."
3.0,Did not look like the picture the bottom half was darkere the fit
3.0,"Even though the skirt has a full top-to-bottom zipper, it does not come apart at the bottom, so you still have to step through the skirt to take it on/off. This makes it useless as a layering piece for me because I wanted to use it hiking under muddy/rainy conditions. It will be impossible to balance on one foot, to pull my foot through, without getting any mud on the skirt from my boots. I already have layering pieces I can put on/take off in a sheltered area with a dry bench and it's quite a pain to have to find such an area, sit down and take off my boots, make the clothing adjustments, put the boots back on, etc. I was buying this to have something I could easily take off on the trail."
3.0,Like them. Looks good. Feels good. Overall there good. Got them as gify so there pretty awesome :) igot them for my &#34;look&#34; they work.
3.0,Unfortunately this was way too small for my head. I had read other reviews saying it was small but thought I would give it a shot. My head is 23 inches around and I couldn’t pull it over my head. I gave it 3 stars because it is a really great product and is great quality but I would guess that your head needs to be around 21 inches or less for it to fit comfortably . I’m giving it to my 10 year old niece.
3.0,Too tight on my arms :-(
3.0,"This item was basically what I asked for. It fits nicely and looks correct. The quality is no nicer than you expect, but it's not thinly cheap. Think Target brand. The bra part in a normal t-shirt, has a bit of a point to it. So your nipples look hard all of the time. Best use under a robe for the bedroom. I would get a different shape for the cup of the bra next time but I would buy it again."
3.0,Elastic at waist too small lay flats 26&#34; for size large my waist 29&#34; very uncomfortable
3.0,"This item was suppose to be one size fits all and came in as a medium.  Definitely not oversized and will not fit me and I am an XL to XXL.  Disappointed because it took over a month to get this item, only to request refund and send back.  Clearly should have not stated One Size because even the package it is in says a Medium.  :("
3.0,A little tighter than expected toe to heel.
3.0,very nice for the price. I wouldnt buy it again though
3.0,"There are 2-3 missing letters while there are 2-3 double lettering... I am afraid that if i order this again, the same thing will happen.."
3.0,Was tooo small for a 2x/3x. Gave to my daughter.. Way to short
3.0,"I haven’t ordered this yet but if you’re going to leave a review, at least make it informative... JS"
3.0,about what I expected for the price
3.0,I like the hat It is nice Although the fair in the picture looks more  poofie in the pictures and  Yes the hat is warm
3.0,"I really wanted to love this top but it has a few character flaws that just didn't work for me. I sized down and I figured since I am a heavy-chested girl(38D), this would give me a more fit to the girls look. It was still too big, and the wiring inside the shirt was wonky. I think the thought about how the shirt was made was great but the execution was lackluster."
3.0,I thought it will be bigger
3.0,"I love pajama jeans but my last order was for medium size. After a few washes, I cannot even get in them anymore. But one pair of medium did fit and continues to fit but now snug.  So I ordered a large and the large is HUGE.  I washed them hoping they would shrink like the others and fit, but no, they are still way too big. The sizes of pajama jeans are inconsistent and I give up on getting the correct sizing."
3.0,Not as good of a fit as I would have liked and a permanent wrinkle in the front that I will have to get used to.
3.0,I ordered a Medium but should have gotten a Large.  It’s right around the waist.  I’m a size 2 in US size if that helps
3.0,Shoe fits but looks weird. It looks like they are always on the wrong foot even when you swap to other foot. Doesn't lay flat on the ground.
3.0,I expected softer more fluid drape and it’s stiff and cheap fabric.
3.0,Mixed review. My boobs are too big for this. My boobs  were cupcaking out the sides like a busted can of biscuits  but luckily my momma has a smaller chest so I'm giving it to her and it looked good.
3.0,Love my leopard print
3.0,The ear muffs tend to come undone if you pull to adjust them to fast it is easy to reattach but sometimes annoying.
3.0,It's a nice piece. Very light weight.
3.0,Fabric felt weird on my skin
3.0,"Overall cute dress for the price, however the quality isn’t the best. There were many little threads that needed to be cut off. It also get wrinkly very quickly."
3.0,I like the product but its not real sterling silver.
3.0,Low quality zipper on the wrong side but its
3.0,"Sturdy construction, but lettering too small."
3.0,This shirt is Soo small we put it on our son's stuffed animal for.fun..waisted money though.
3.0,"These shorts a comfortable, fit well, and have a decent build quality. However, they don't have back pockets. Instead, they have some weird little stitched in things that look like the tops of pockets. Yuck."
3.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend who loves gshock watches. He could only fit four in it and he had to turn them side ways. This is a good addition for anyone who collects gshock, but not for the price!"
3.0,"I'm tall and bottom heavy 5'10, 36DD-32-47. My arms and upper bottom are a m/l bottom XL- it ripped as soon as I tried to pull the pants up. Not made for bottom heavy gals. The colors are pretty so I will sew it and give it to my niece with no curves who wears a size 9/10- it will fit her nice"
3.0,"It doesn't drape as nicely as show in the picture, kind of hangs down straight and bunches."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt, it's super cute and the cut is right. But immediately upon trying it on I notices the button holes are ""hairy"", that is, they're already fraying and getting caught on the buttons. The shirt is cute but not worth trying to figure out how to fix it myself."
3.0,Bought this as a gift for my mom's husband.  Great price but didn't have the crown on the face.  I know he didn't notice but I did.
3.0,They run small. I like my pjs. A bit baggy.  Very pretty though and well made
3.0,I like the idea of this hat - nice style.  It has a little too much fabric and slouches down farther than I expected.  The bill of the cap is also very cheap...feels like cardboard.  But it's a cute hat for the price.
3.0,"I like the fabric but this outfit runs big. I ordered it twice and still got it wrong. I ordered a XL and a L, but I need a M. Too much trouble sending it back, so I gave them as gifts."
3.0,It is not exactly as pictured. The sleeves are DEFINITELY different. Im 5”5 but like my pants and jumpsuits long because I wear heels everyday. The length of this jumpsuit barely comes to my ankles. I got an XXL but probably could have gone with an XL.  It still is cute for the office but about $10 over priced
3.0,These watch bands are comfortable and look nice.  Unfortunately they let loose easily. It's a mirror I haven't lost my watch.
3.0,"the bust is a bit tight, but there is a material flap that can be tacked down behind the buttons. the rest fits fine."
3.0,"I’m 5’9, fairly skinny, and the dress fit on me like a bag, I purchased a size small."
3.0,"The fabric was okay - it's fine for an inexpensive blazer.  My issue was that it fit very tight through the shoulders and upper arm.  I had very little ability to move comfortably.  THAT SAID:  I have wide shoulders and larger upper arms.  If you have a narrow shoulder set and thin upper arms, this one is for you.<br /><br />It fit fine through the bust and waist, length was nice.<br /><br />Color is true to the photo.  This is not tan, it is a shade of peach or apricot.  I was hoping it would be more camel in color and the photo was wrong. It is not.<br /><br />I am 5'9"", 200 lbs and upper arms are stout due to a farm life daily workout.  Shoulders have always been wide and problematic, all my life."
3.0,"These are cheap for a reason. They work, but you can't close the ring all the way after you've bent it out of place. I use it for my nostril. It looks good, but it's just cheap."
3.0,But it gets kinda twisted up as you wear it. I love the way it looks but am constantly readjusting and untwisting.
3.0,Too small and the cut/ shape was off from what is pictured
3.0,Small fits more like a large. Better on a larger size person.
3.0,Material quality could be better the colors are nice and the product fit my niece. The cheap material holds it back but at this price what could you really expect.
3.0,"Bizzare! I was looking for something to wear to Thanksgiving dinner over brown leggings. This was just what I wanted but the reviews held me back. I could see in the photos of the different colors that the cowl was inconsistent but nothing else fit the bill. When it arrived I spent ten minutes trying to figure if there is a front and a back. The color is perfect and it is soft, comfortable, and just warm enough without felling hot. The cowl is bizzare. I folded it, tugged it, rearranged it and just as the reviews said it would just not stay in any likable position. Had I paid more for it I would have sent it back. My solution was to take a needle and thread and tack the bottom side seam of the cowl to the side seam of the shoulder at  the point where the cowl is sewn to the body of the sweater. I did the same dead center front and back. It now looks pretty normal. I machine washed it in cold water and air dried it flat."
3.0,"The necklace is nice looking. The design is nice and cute sun shape. So it looks cute, however the material is kinda cheap feeling. It feels like plastic. Also, the color of gold looks fake.<br /><br />Overall, it looks cute on neck but feels cheap!"
3.0,"The dress is super long and the material is thin, kind of cheap. Easily snags"
3.0,Cute but Was any to big so I gave it way...I would go 1 size down ur size
3.0,The backless is very pretty but comes apart too often I am afraid to lose it.
3.0,"Quality is poor but my 4 year old daughter loved them. They are very cute and loaded with glitter like she wanted. Super light weight, that was the first indication that they weren't going to be long for this world.  They're also really inexpensive. Not very supportive for a day walking around a theme park, even for a small child. Overall appearance was adorable and my daughter would be happy to have them in all colors. I may buy again but not for her main pair of shoes."
3.0,These dresses are way shorter then it shows on the photo
3.0,Liked color. Dislike that the size is larger than expected
3.0,"I like this ring. It's big, bold, and beautiful. I'm giving it three stars because it looks like black paint between the petals."
3.0,Pretty but not very shiny
3.0,I ordered four pins for my sisters . One came with a broken pin. I am still waiting for it’s replacement for two weeks.
3.0,Super cheap feeling but for $1 it’s what I expected. Worth the money.
3.0,Cute but did not fit. I could not get into my size. Maybe a large would have been better. Great customer service. Refunded me and allowed me to keep item!
3.0,this thing is a good product but because of how it is constructed it keeps slipping off at her heal. I probably wouldn't buy this product again.
3.0,"I actually love the shirt, but I purchased it in the light green and it looks like I'm wearing scrubs. I will purchase again in a different color"
3.0,"Based on the description, I mistakenly thought it was black/brown reversible.  It is not.  the surface of the belt is brown and the edges are black."
3.0,Not equivalent of American size
3.0,They are too dark
3.0,"This dress is nice, but it is a tad big. I am 5'3, 125lbs, and 30F. I ordered a Small."
3.0,"The sweatshirt was nice quality, and I would have kept it but it ran very large."
3.0,"This one's hard to rate. I'm 5'7&#34;, 135 lbs and got the large because I didn't want it tight or uncomfortable in the crotch area. It has the attached shorts underneath and a light material over that hides most of the under swim suit. It looks more like beachwear you can swim in, without looking too silly. I'm a grandma that needs a suit to take the grandkids swimming sometimes.  On the down side, there is no real bra-type, just separate cups. I sew a little so I'll attempt to make that more secure, may have to sew in more elastic.<br /><br />I was very annoyed because I ordered the blue but received the green. I have no time for a return (and the seller answered a question about the photo being the green when clicking on the blue-said definitely would get the blue!) So, very disappointing but I have something to wear...if I can fix the &#34;bra&#34; a little better."
3.0,"I like the length of the dress but the sleeves are a bit short, material is somewhat thin but not see through. Chest is a little snug but not horrible, I would order up a size. Im 5'3, 120 lbs and ordered a M. Cute though."
3.0,I was so excited to get this! Tried it in and it was too small. I went with the other reviews and got a medium. I’m 5’2 and 145lbs. Wish I would have gotten a bigger size. The length is a little weird as well.
3.0,It’s ok. I probably wouldn’t purchase again
3.0,"These are great to wear with dresses or leggings, tough and chic!  Two issues, they are very slippery- I had to buy traction soles to stick to the bottom so I didn't fall on my butt while walking fast, they make a loud clicking sound when I walk (like high heeled shoes do).  The other issue is that the laces are horrible and stiff.  But for the price they are a great look!"
3.0,"Cute. I bought them for my 19 year old daughter, but she didn't like them, so I kept them."
3.0,Fit tight.. Darker than the color shows
3.0,"Thought this would be a fun summer top, but sigh, it is made from very heavy polyester. Though I like the colors, the yolk of my garment was not the nice wide one shown on the primary ad picture. A return was approved but the shipping is on the customer and costs nearly half the price of the purchase.<br /><br />Update on the return: seller got back to me and made my return a good experience after all. Thank you, Selexu"
3.0,Shirt quality wasn’t great. Starting getting messed up fabric after about the 5th wash
3.0,Not a great quality.  A disappointing purchase for me.
3.0,"The strings are very thin and snap easily under normal daily use. The mask feels thin, and has a 2nd layer on the inside that is just loose and uncomfortable.  Would not recommend."
3.0,"The detail and quality of the earrings is fantastic, BUT giant!  Too over powering.  Woulk have been lovely if smaller."
3.0,"I  love the color, the material, the way my butt looks, and the price. But you know whats a deal breaker for me? That skinny elastic band across the front of the waist band that just seems so cheap and is not at ALL comfortable. Had to send them back, they were perfect otherwise."
3.0,I had to return the dress it was very tight in the breast and arms. Otherwise it was a cute dress.
3.0,Convenient but feels very cheap. Hat covers my view and gets weighted down by the clear cover
3.0,"The Filter Pocket is Sewn Below the Nose, So it's Beautiful, Stylish, But Has No Nose Protection at All"
3.0,Nada especial por su precio
3.0,Very comfortable but thin and somewhat see through.  It does shrink once washed so I would recommend hand wash and hang dry unless it is large on you in which case a little shrinking will be ok.
3.0,I'm a size 8 and they are quite tight. Sad day
3.0,"This shirt is SO adorable & I loved it the first time I wore it. Then, I washed it. Its one of those fabrics that literally every single fuzzy in your drier clings to & it's impossible to get off. Very upsetting. I was ready to order this in every color! I'm glad I washed it first!"
3.0,"For me the pink dress was too sheer and at the time I didn't have a slip, so I returned the dress. Also more flattering with a belt, otherwise pretty shapeless."
3.0,Was so beautiful when purchased. Wore for a week & a little daimond fell out. After a months wear the rose gold color wore off & its super ugly lol please dont buy if you plan on wearing more than a month.
3.0,Touch screen doesn’t work
3.0,"Didn't work for me. I'm 5'8, 150 lbs, ordered the large. Usually wear a medium top, and the top on this romper was too loose, so I'd say it's true to size, but for much shorter women. The shorts weren't even shorts, more like underwear, half of my booty was showing. Sizing up doesn't help, then it's just ill fitting in other areas. Too bad it isn't made longer because it could have been cute."
3.0,Very small compared to size chart
3.0,"It's pretty, but the material reminds me of sheets.  I guess it's fine for the price."
3.0,"I would have been better off, buying a better quality loupe, for a little more money.  It ian't bad, just nothing special."
3.0,"The material is unfortunately too cheap and the collar is made of cotton rather than a dress shirt mater, which I expected. Still cute, but not for the occasion I wanted."
3.0,"The ring arrived on time, was nicely packaged and is as pretty as expected. I’ve been wearing it around the clock for about two weeks.  I wear a size nine and it fits a little looser than I care for.  Also, it is starting to chip on the underside. It looks like it has copper beneath it. Today I noticed that my finger had a dark circle around it from the ring.<br />I’d give it a 2, and probably should, but for the price I don’t believe I should really expect more."
3.0,Back was way to short did not cover my bottom.  Unfortunately I will be returning.  Would be cute for super tiny size 0-8 maybe?
3.0,Wife is 36C bust and 30 inch waist.  Waist/torso fit fine but the bust area was waaay too big.
3.0,"I love the dress. However, the dress sold to me was clearly worn and returned. It had really, really  bad B.O. Given the date of the occasion, I needed this dress and wasn’t able to send back and reorder to get a new one on time. I took a gamble and washed the dress. As far as the fit I normally wear size M but def needed a large for a medium like  fit. Order up ladies. 3 stars for stinky dress. 5 starts for the style and fit."
3.0,They are really pretty. And they actually didn’t hurt my ears like fake gauges usually do but they definitely infected my ears. Good if you’re not sensitive to metal
3.0,I liked the dress but gave 3 stars bcs the material is not the best and the dress looked washed out. Plus I ordered a black and got washed out green
3.0,Somewhat on the small size.
3.0,"Cute dress!! waist doesn't stretch well so it is pretty tight going over my bust. Material is extremely thin you can see through it, I wore under shorts and cami. Over all its cute casual"
3.0,These were very tiny compared to the model wearing
3.0,"Only 3 stars because  it is a huge shirt,  I did order a small I was thinking about a medium and thank goodness I didn't order the medium.  It is a nice soft cotton and  is actually really comfortable it's just huge!  Would be great to use as a beach cover-up not an every day shirt."
3.0,"After a month of less usage,the bracelet broke."
3.0,The cut is a bit off - the part under the neck is super thin and fits odd. Not impressed.
3.0,nice watch wish it was a bit smaller in size but is very light weight comfortable to wear
3.0,"It is nice and soft, so definitely packable. Unfortunately it is way too big for my head."
3.0,Super soft and seem to wear well. The only thing I don’t like is the super thick waist band. I have a small waist and wider hips so these have a tendency to ride up and the waist band is so thick you can see it through tops. I’m not going to purchase again but will wear them at home for sleeping maybe.
3.0,This mask fits well but after 2 washes the beads started to fall off.
3.0,Rather large. But well crafted.
3.0,It looked cute but one would really want a larger diameter to call it a sun shade.  Used it in a parade and would have liked more cover but it was cute for the price.
3.0,These socks are okay in that they don't slide down but they are thin so after a few weeks you can we sure to get holes.
3.0,The product definitely came as an orange color and not a light pink but other than that they fit fine!
3.0,Did not see any warnings to order a size larger than needed. If it's already here be warned. I passed it on to someone smaller. We use it off label for our kids lightsaber programs as protective body armor. It works well for that light contact.
3.0,Too Small. I could barely zip it. And the fingerslots are tiny. Cut them all off. Order a size up!
3.0,The fabric is ok. The top was larger than I expected it to be. The part that I am not liking is the elastic used in the arms and legs. It feels like I've got hair scrunchies wrapped around my biceps. I'm worried about chafing but time will tell. I'll add to this review in a few days and let you know.
3.0,"I'm going to be as honest as possible. This is a cool looking shirt and it fits nice and slim. Let me tell you this though, each time I unbuttoned a button to try it on a little bit of thread came loose. Thats not good but my shirt doesn't seem to be falling apart at all. The sizing threw me off to. I normally wear a U.S. medium so I ordered the shirt that said it would fit like a U.S. medium (either L/US M or XL/US M i forgot). Now the shirt feels like a slim fitting medium through the body, but the sleeves fit like a tourniquet. They are ungodly tight. So that being said this shirt is cool to wear casually or if you want to go out and get yucky with the boys, but if you lift weights at all and you normally wear mediums get the size that is said to fit like a US large. If you are any bigger than a casual lifter then don't even think about getting this shirt."
3.0,Heavy and not that soft
3.0,I should have looked closer to the way it looked in photo....not that crazy about it and it wasnt cheap
3.0,Definitely not what I was expecting. The whole deal seems kinda cheap to me.
3.0,These are VERY SMALL.i doubt it would work for a tshirt or scarf.....will be sending them back. They are VERY pretty...just too small....
3.0,"I'm 5'9"", 160 lbs, and curvy. I bought these in large. They fit snug around my hips and tush, and feel straight beyond that. The thin material is breezy, but the lighter colors need skin-colored undies that stay flat on your skin. The red and pink embarrasingly show my thong line and cellulite, even through the foldover, but the black and blue hide all that much better."
3.0,The pattern and material of the shirt was so cute and I really wanted to like it. However I found the elastic part to be uncomfortable and when I lift my arms the shirt would come up and stay there so I would have to pull it back down. Unfortunately this wasn't the shirt for me.
3.0,It was cute however it is not a sweater and it indicated on the tittle is more of a long sleeve t-shirt
3.0,Way big for my youngest but he was only a few months old but fit my one year old perfectly!
3.0,"Somewhat too small, more for a young kid than for an adult"
3.0,"A little larger than I expected. The material is very thin, but it's a cute cut"
3.0,I bought these for my daughter to wear when she figure skates because her feet are the thing that gets very cold.  Yet we have to worry about thickness as to not take up too much room in her boot.  These are TALL!  I knew that they go up to the knee but that must be with a good folded over top.  They are practically over her thigh.  She is 11 and not quite 5 feet tall.  So I get that.  But she has a size 7 foot and I thought the heel would at least fall in the right place.  It goes up to her ankle area.  So just expect it to be long and stretch.  The help a little.  Not super great but better then regular stockings.  Looking still for the right thing to help!
3.0,I returned this because the shoulders were huge--it felt masculine and boxy. It didn't look good on me at all.
3.0,"The skirt itself probably isn't too far off from being true to size, but the inner lining skirt is SO much smaller that you can't  wear the skirt. Really odd to me. It wa true to color and really pretty. The quality looked nice and the material felt nice. I had to return it due to the weirdly sized liner. :/"
3.0,"Very cute, nice product. Not great for youths. As the charm slides off vey easily."
3.0,"The quality was fine for the price, but these cloths are way off in their sizing. Way, way smaller then what we wear in the US."
3.0,My favorite print and color so I couldnt resist! I have large hands so this watch did fit tight even though it stretches.
3.0,I didn't like the fit. And the material is too thin.
3.0,These serve their purpose. We have one teacher and 5 students in our home who wear masks all day. They felt it was more of a hinderance than help. Not to the fault of the quality or the product though.
3.0,"I wear a size 10. I ordered XL based on the descriptions. It is very stretchy, and a bit thin. But I like it. It will serve its purpose for the price..lol"
3.0,I return this item because it was big and bulky resembling the original band that came with my galaxy watch and I was looking for something more slim and thin if you’re looking for a product that was the most original band just in a different color this would be for you
3.0,Its a nice watch
3.0,"LIGHTWEIGHT, GREAT COLOR. SITS RATHER HIGH, THE RIM IS NOT VERY WIDE."
3.0,It was torn at the side
3.0,Wrinkles won't come out after wash and dry.
3.0,"Beautiful, soft and stretchy. The buttons near the crotch are cheap and do not button well making it sketchy to wear alone or under a skirt. I still can't get the middle one to really button. :("
3.0,Ok glasses . Didn’t expect much for the price but basically disposable sunglasses for festival
3.0,Received 20% off.  Just want everyone know this defective before buying.
3.0,"I loved everything about this dress except the pocket. It was just too huge and pooched out; looked very strange to me. If there were about 2&#34; less fabric in the pocket, it would be a super cute asymmetric style.<br /><br />Otherwise, it fit well, was well made, loved the thick, stretchy fabric. But I'm returning it because of the oversized pocket."
3.0,Had to return since the metal was bothering me.
3.0,"It’s not a bad bag, but not sure it will hold up long term."
3.0,"Purchased last minute for a bright colors affair and was surprised upon arrival...The color is darker than what I expected...darker than the advertised photo. I still wore it to the “bright” colors affair as I didn’t have any other option. Also, the dress was a Lil shorter than expected and the material caused it to rise up easily...which forced me to pull it down all night, even when standing still.<br /><br />I ordered a size Small: my measurements- Size 2 waist 27 bust 34c Hips 36"
3.0,"So I really loved this jumper like really. But it came on time for my work event and it was too large. Had to pin it to my bra! I bought the medium for reference I am 5’2 140 lbs 34C, pear shaped and usually wear Sz6 dress and 8P pants. The rest of the fit was fine. The small would have been so much better so unfortunately I have to return since they are out of smalls"
3.0,too small had to sent back
3.0,Cute but I could not breathe in it. It’s a little too thick.
3.0,"I ordered the red and blue flora but I was sent the red flora. The material is not too bad but the sewing could be better. The alignment on the front is completely off. Also, the one I received did not have the white rope drawsting as pictured...it had a flat black shoelace like string tie. I ordered a small and it fit as expected. I am 5'3 and the length is actually perfect. It did not drag on the floor even without any shoes on. So if you are tall, you may want to keep that in mind."
3.0,"I ordered an XL based on the description which mentioned 'loose fit' 'baggy' and 'oversize' - well it turns out I should have gone with a 2XL instead as the shirt fits tightly (i an just barely button it) and it may shrink as most cotton flannels do just a bit.<br /><br />For reference I am 6'3"" tall, 220 lbs, shoulders 21"", chest 46.5"", waist 38"", inseam 33"" and I wear a 35"" in dress-shirt-sleeves. The sleeves were a touch short too but that's just my reality when not ordering a tall size, and so I'm used to that.<br /><br />Having said all that, the blue pattern looks really nice and the shirt looks professionally sewn so I handed it off to my son who got his height (or lack thereof) from his mother. I'm sure he will like it just fine.<br /><br />I can't rate this item higher because the seller didn't take the time to include a size chart in with the pictures and it is obvious from the listing that they did a hurried copy+paste from some other item where that item was intended for a lady. How else can I explain the fact that for sizing help they state, 'A1:Our shirts are standard size, order your size:S=US 4-6,M=US 8-10,L= US 12-14,XL=16-18,XXL=18-20.'"
3.0,"I got these in 1/2 inch. I’ve been at that size for forever now but when these arrived, they are a little too small for my ears. They pop out super easily so I’m almost afraid to wear them. Maybe I should’ve gone a size up?"
3.0,The design and quality was good but too large almost size 42
3.0,The cage portion can get loose. While the bra section fits well.
3.0,"Update---3 weeks, only one of the shoes light up...Bummer!"
3.0,They arrived smaller than I thought they were going to be
3.0,"I ordered this summer shirt for my six year old daughter to wear when playing outside. When it arrived, I noticed that the material was pretty thin. This was actually a positive since it gets very hot where we live. However, when my daughter went to try the shirt on, it just looked off. The cut is odd and not flattering for any child. The sleeves drop down at a weird angle. It gives the shirt a cheap feel. If you’re looking for a nice looking shirt for your child to wear when going out, then I don’t recommend this shirt. It’s pretty much only good for play time."
3.0,"I ADORE these nose screws. They’re understated, dainty, and polished but with one big design flaw. The screw part on the inside of the nose is too short so I lost three is the first week while sleeping, showering, or washing my face. So sad."
3.0,"I used reorder feature to purchase another red bag like I had previously purchased.  What I received was a completely different color leather and finish.  Instead of red leather, it looked like iridescent burgundy patent leather.  Vendors explanation was that there are variations in colors of leather.  This was much more than a variation.  I returned it and bought a bag from a different vendor"
3.0,"I ordered a Large in this dress and I can normally fit a US 12-14 women’s and the dress was toooooooo  big. Especially in the bust area. I’m not very large in that area...36C. The quality of the dress was okay. However, it did put me in the mind of a choir rob for church.  The pleats were alright and the dress did look somewhat like the pic. ....I just wasn’t that fond of the dress. If....it would’ve fit.....I’ve might’ve worn the dress despite the pleats and simple look it gave. But I sent it back for a full refund which was hassle free and easy."
3.0,Kid likes
3.0,Material looks weak but we'll see how they hold up.
3.0,"Very large fit for my wrist, still a cute accessory"
3.0,"I thought the body was going to be longer, kind of a cropped style/look"
3.0,I like the ear rings but the silver quality is not that great.
3.0,"Loved the color and fit of these, but after washing (as directed) one time, multiple areas are coming unstitched.  Hoping I can sew it and fix it, but was disappointed especially after only one wash."
3.0,The shirt pockets are too small. Will hardly hold a pen...
3.0,I'm 5'5 155lbs and bought a M in green. I like the material but was hoping for a bigger/baggy fit and these are more like a jogger. I'm going to return and buy a large.
3.0,My husband loves this but it is so small that he can't even put all his cards in the wallet
3.0,This ring does not look as nice as the picture
3.0,"This is really cute on and matches my rose gold Fitbit very well! It was a little stiff at first but has worn on well. My only complaint is that after three weeks of daily wear, it smells a bit rank. I’m going to wash it with a bit of vinegar and soap and see if that helps. If you work out with your Fitbit on, you’ll want to change your band if you’re going to be sweaty."
3.0,"It’s nice and loose around the ears, which is why I wanted this to begin with. But the downside is that the graphic looks distorted as it is not form-fitting to the face. The plain black one is much better (I got both). I’m a female with average height and weight. It’s loose for me."
3.0,"I bought these to go in gift bags for all the kids who came to my son’s birthday party. I thought they were perfect for a Pete the Cat themed birthday party! They felt a little cheap/flexible, but I didn’t think much of it - they’re for little kids anyways.<br /><br />Well a few pairs got left behind. Because they fit so snug, I used a pair as a headband - which works perfectly! I went outside to get the mail and slid them down over my eyes and o m g! They’re terrible! I thought they were just dirty, so I wiped them off, same issue. I took them off and held them in front of my face to look thru them and they’re ridiculous! They’re so warped and uneven it makes it difficult to see properly thru them. If you want a sunglasses headband - these are where it’s at! If you want actual sunglasses for your kid/kids - don’t buy these. I can’t imagine these are good on the eyes."
3.0,I ordered XL and it fit me like a medium shirt...  I was planning to use it as a warmer top layer to my t-shirt or tank tops under neath but then it was too tight and bulky
3.0,"It's a cheap dress so I am really not that unhappy with it. It's kind of thin, just keep that in mind for undergarments. The &#34;off the shoulder&#34; style is really cute but I wish I would have maybe sized up one more because my broad shoulders make it difficult to move my arms any higher than my waist. It also makes the ruffles lay a little too flat. Other than that it's a cute dress! I am 5'7&#34; and it isn't too short or too long."
3.0,Runs small and fits like tights. Not enough thickness or coverage to be pants. However they are pretty.
3.0,This fits nice and is cute but the I'm only giving it three stars because The pattern looks nothing like the picture.  I bought it in black and the picture is much more beautiful than what I received.  I'm keeping it because it's cute and it fits but I wish the pattern was as pictured.
3.0,"They were nice, but on more than half of them, the round ball on the end that goes through your nose was sharp and jagged, rather than a smooth ball.  I t was uncomfortable to put them in."
3.0,"Although it was very beautiful and I received many compliments at the office, it broke after 4 months.  Nothing weighty is responsible.  Not a result of opening/closing the magnetic clasp too many times (because I would slip over my head).  One wire just unraveled and the beads spilled all over the floor.  Pretty, but not sturdy.  This replaced my Hidden Hollow Beads lanyard, which I had for 1.5 years.  I'll have to go back to them."
3.0,"Interesting concept, but it fits the wrist awkwardly."
3.0,Ordered 4x; waist is smaller than 3x shorts and 3x pajama pants. Buyer beware! Will be returning.
3.0,"This works. Don't try to use it for anything that isn't all the way rounded, I can get it to hold my star shaped top but the half moon and the heart won't stay.<br /><br />If you have bad nearsightedness and a face dermal like me then you will need to wear contacts when you use this tool because you won't be able to get super close to the mirror but you also might knock your frames clear off your face when you try to twist."
3.0,Its not as thick as I thought it was going to be. Therefore not keeping the littles head as warm as I hoped.
3.0,"The fabric is wonderfully soft to the touch, but the sizing is wrong.  The sleeves were so tight, it restricted movement and the body was too snug.  I had to return it for a refund."
3.0,Chain is easily broken same with the clasp
3.0,"Only had light use for 3 weeks and the padding is already worn out. Very disappointed. Bottom thick, warm material, draw string to hold them on"
3.0,"It looked really cute when I saw it here, but I don't really think that it's worth that price.  It actually looks really cute when you try it on but when I close it the top heart doesn't align correctly with the bottom heart. So it looks all crooked from the top."
3.0,"Size guide wasn’t quite right, material is see through."
3.0,Turns my skin green..
3.0,This product is advertised for women. It was large even on my husbands face . It measures 8 inches by 3.75 inches in the package.
3.0,"Nice hat, but it's not really low profile as advertised. It either sits too high on my head or too low to my ears"
3.0,"This is  a very pretty nightgown and the pockets are a great feature, but the band hits uncomfortably mid-chest.  I should have returned it."
3.0,"I adore this nose ring. The jewels are the size I like it, cute but not dominating the whole piece. I will be purchasing the remaining colors in the very near future!<br /><br />UPDATE: One of the stones has broken after a few weeks. Had to throw it out. Reducing rating from five stars to three."
3.0,"The material and stitching don't seem like they'll hold up to years of daily pocket wear, but time will tell.  Otherwise, this wallet is exactly as advertised and performs it's function perfectly fine.  No complaints yet.  Fits quite comfortably in a standard sized front pocket."
3.0,"The smoky quartz stones are beautiful beads, and I love the style and adjustor on the bracelet, but after only about a week, the chord fell apart in the middle and all my stones went tumbling.  I’ve had to try and make a new bracelet myself, but it didn’t work well.  This product needs a stronger construction."
3.0,Nice shirt but ended up returning it as it was a little bland in person.
3.0,"They fit my smaller face really well and are stylish enough. The frames are cold on the face in the winter since they are metal. They are helpful when there is a lot of traffic at night but I didn't notice any benefit at night, otherwise."
3.0,Worked well for what we needed it for.
3.0,The fabric is much to thick for a summer shirt and runs too slim size wise.
3.0,Odd fit for my body. It loosely gapped in the waist on my backside. I had to return.
3.0,I don't like how short these are.
3.0,The design is cute but the filter didn’t stick inside
3.0,They are good for pajamas only.  They really do not hold their shape
3.0,It was tight around the hem at the top.  I'm not like huge chested.  Bra size 34 C.  I got a medium.  It's wearable though.  It's not as cute as the picture suggests.  Definitely not ugly though!
3.0,Great shirt just go up a size.
3.0,I wish this hat fit my head better. It's like there are two points on either side of the hat near where the bill attaches to the cap - almost like it was folded and cannot be uncreased.
3.0,"Nice fabric and this washes well....but was hoping it would shrink some, as it is way oversized.  I am normally a M - L.....the M was way too big.  I should have gone with a Small.  Don't know if I'm going to keep this or not?  Disappointed.  The material is thin so like other reviewers said, if you put a phone in one of the pockets, it will definitely pull it down."
3.0,Had it for 3 weeks and it is already fading. Cute ring though.
3.0,I am usually a 2x sometimes 3x..i ordered this in a 4xl and it was quite clingy. It was tight in my arms area and not as flowing as i expected it to be in the picture. But still wearable and quite pretty.
3.0,The fit..
3.0,"Comfy and fit well, the ranbow strip peeled off on the second day"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:719bcd7dfea2cf5765596bb7cc0fce34]] I like it, but it's odd. Huge pockets! Venting is nice. Snug at hips, OK-ish at bust, very baggy in the back and tummy. Comfy, soft, just odd fit. Size small"
3.0,run too small
3.0,"Just one of the balls kept the bright, just 2 weeks of use .. not daily used ..."
3.0,"This dress is very cute. The pink is very light. I am 5ft 3, so it’s a little too long on me and makes me look heavier than I really am. But I think it could be really flattering for a taller person."
3.0,the picture of the glasses look good in person the glasses look like a pair you would find at a dollar store.
3.0,It's a cute sweater at first but it starts pilling and looking old after a handful of washes
3.0,Sizes run large and pockets are much too low. Pocket contents continuously bounce around with each pedal stroke.
3.0,"I bought this bathing suit for my daughter. It appeared that the bottom was a normal bikini cut, but it fit her like a thong.  The top fit good and it was well made, just too skimpy for my kiddo."
3.0,Beautiful ring but it snags on EVERYTHING. I slept with it on and it snagged a hole in my sheets and pillow case.
3.0,It’s OK for the price
3.0,"Its a nice fabric but Very sheer and see through. Their are 2 layers but both are see through, and I am returning it. I bought a small one because the M was too long. but the small is just as long, the only difference is that the sleeves are a little bit shorter. Will be returning the Small one too."
3.0,Its not real so you should expect costume jewelry.
3.0,"The band way to thin, will break easily if you need to take it off a couple times"
3.0,"It's pretty but too large for my petite frame. I gave it to my daughter, it fit her perfectly."
3.0,"Dress is nice, good material, however the colors are not as bright as pictured, looks kind of dull."
3.0,"I order these for a party Face Mask personalization the quality was good. However, they would not stay on the adults face the were to small."
3.0,"This shirt is way to small for the average US woman. I like the style and material but even though I ordered the biggest size I could , it was too small. I tried to e-mail address the package came with but it was no good. It said it would refund my money. I have a very petite daughter and two petite granddaughters who might be able to fit these shirts I was disappointed because I have know way of contacting the company or returning the shirt. Beware and don't order unless you are very petite and could fit in the oriental sizes. They don't get our larger bones and waists. The prices are low but if you can't wear them then don't waste your money."
3.0,I wasn't totally disappointed in the scarf but I got it thinking it faded greenish/blue. It does not. its blue. just beware if you think it fades into colors this one does not. shipping and cost were great. Seller response was fast and easy. thank you.
3.0,Glasses were too small for my face.
3.0,"These would have been so great if their size chart wasn’t so off. I’m 5’6, a solid 150 pounds, 28 waist, 35 hips. Pant size 6. Legging size small. Gym short size medium. I looked at their size chart and ordered a medium. They’re just way too big to wear. There’s a ton of extra material through the waist, hips and butt. The only place they were snug at was the hem. Such a bummer. These seem like they’re made really nicely. The material is thick and sewn together well. High quality faux leather look, not cheapo looking. If you get these, order your normal legging size and ignore their size chart! I wish I had a small, I bet they’d be perfect."
3.0,"Definitely nice boots, but one of the hooks where the lace goes through fell off right away, and alao the metal around the hole where the lace goes through, fell off."
3.0,The XL is too tight and the material is see through.
3.0,Very thin fabric product just ok
3.0,"Comfortable, but won't stay on feet. Customer service tells you to contact them with any problems, but they won't respond to my emails."
3.0,"It looks nice, but it didn't go with my dress.  Maybe I'll find something else to wear it with it later."
3.0,"I like the look, however, when I tried it on the fit/cut was a little off."
3.0,I would say these are Womens glasses. Runs small for my head so they are tight on me with no flexibly.
3.0,I like it okay.
3.0,I gave my 2xl to my size medium daughter. But do soft and light
3.0,"Reviews were inconsistent:  Some reviews said it ran small, other said it ran true to size.  Well, the latter is completely off base.  It runs VERY small.  I bought my usual XL & could only get it pulled down to my boobs.  I'm disappointed as I have a fun golf event in October in Florida & thought this light weight dress paired my orange wedges would be perfect for the evening events.  Normally I'd order it in the next size up but am worried that an XXL will still be too small...."
3.0,Seems like a good lens but the snap on/off mechanism is annoying and too risky for competition
3.0,"I'm 5 2&#34; 130lbs. These will prob fit anyone, but didn't fit me comfortably. I felt like the top part squeezes a bit much. Wasn't crazy about the fabric...I prefer a smooth feel...these remind me of a thin sweater fabric. The black came out so linty after washing. Will either give away or send back."
3.0,"The bracelet is beautiful. But i would say it is too big for my wrist where it always slipped down pretty far to my arm whenever I rise my arm up for something. Even though it is adjustable, i have tried to put it all the way in and still lossy on the wrist. Other than that, its a pretty nice bracelet I have purchased ever."
3.0,Look nice but Cheaply made and falls apart.
3.0,"One was bent out of shape, I had to re bend"
3.0,"I like the design, it just fits large, especially in the waist and hips."
3.0,"It's real cute, but it smelled HORRIBLE.  The smell was a mix of under arm, sweaty feet, and sweaty butt crack.  It even lingered in the room where I opened it.  I'm going to try washing and see what happens."
3.0,very thin and look over instructions
3.0,"I was expecting a pair, not just one. Other than that, it's beautiful."
3.0,A bit snug under arm area.
3.0,I could have gone with a size smaller but it’s so hard to know these days. I think they should show a chart with measurements because my large could be different from theirs. People look at me and think I wear a small but I wear a med. I ordered medium but could have went with small.
3.0,"The pajama is exactly as pictures, but the great disappointment is that it is not 100% cotton. Seller, please, don't mislead your buyers. The tag says 75% polyester, 20% cotton, 5% spandex. Since I purchased not to sleep, but wear in the house, I keep it."
3.0,Not as flowy as it looks in the photos
3.0,Just received the product. They are beautiful.  Really excited to give these to my daughters for Christmas.  Unfortunately the solid back of the metal holders was broken.  Curious on the info to get it replaced.
3.0,"not the best, donated to charity"
3.0,I like the earrings are make
3.0,It not that thick and the fabric is not the best
3.0,cute but way small for what the size should be. I could not even get it on.
3.0,beautiful color - excellent swimsuit cover up
3.0,"The skirt itself looks as expected, but it has a thick elastic waistband and I ordered a size LARGER than my usual size, and although I can put it on just fine, the band squishes in all the wrong places."
3.0,"The shirt functions as expected. My only issue is the zipper, gets  stuck some of the time.  I would re-order again but a different zipper would be great."
3.0,Really love these stamps but would like more varieties
3.0,A lot of my hair falls out I think it’s because it’s a dupe but that being said it does define curls.
3.0,Although the material and color are amazing. The fit is horrible. They ride up soo far that they are not flattering. Also run small so I’d go a size up for extra comfy room.
3.0,"I had high hopes for this shirt for my upcoming surgery but there was some sort of either thin areas on the front of the shirt that looked like a ""faded M"".  The grey is not something I'd call a pretty grey so this shirt is definitely not for me.  Will be returning."
3.0,"Gets crumpled on package but it's a cheap, cute, paper hat."
3.0,"This picture is very decieving. It first look see they but it is. I was not planning on wearing for a beach cover up, thought I could wear doing the house. Too sheer for that. However, I will keep it to wear over my swimsuit on the beach."
3.0,Band consistently comes undone.
3.0,"They're nice, but I expected some the pearls to be more big, I bought ones simlar to these & paid $1.00 for an individual pack...."
3.0,Eats up the battery wayyyyy too quickly..
3.0,"These socks are very cozy and extremely well made....quality product. I’m a ladies size 10.5 and I have slim legs and these are too snug around my calves, making the fit uncomfortable, even for the large size socks."
3.0,have to return...a whole size too big for my daughter
3.0,Little camel toe
3.0,"This purse is my new favorite. My only issue is that the side pockets are too small for a water bottle or umbrella as suggested in the description. Be aware that the strap is too slick to stay on your shoulder, but is is comfortable worn as a crossbody purse. It is a perfect bag for travel or shopping.<br />Update 4 months later: downgrading one star because the strap of the bag is coming apart. I have zigzag stitched the strap where it attaches at the top and all along the edges. It is no surprise that a cheap bag is disintegrating at a stress point and this type of fabric is nortoriously unstable. My stitching is not pretty but no one will be close enough to notice. I still like it for travel."
3.0,The front velcro is too long and needs to be smaller but the sandals are soft and comfortable
3.0,the kid liked them but they are cheaply made.  One came already kind of messed up so we only got a couple of wears out of it before it stripped out.
3.0,little long and tight
3.0,"Its cute, its comfy, i already knew i was taking it to a Taylor because im 5’0 😂 but i read the reviews looked at the size chart an it was super loose on me 😓 im just gonna have them take it in when they shorten it but for size importance im a size 3/5 and a small would have been a comfy fit it probs would have taken an xs size to be snug 🤷🏻‍♀️ (I ordered a medium) But still worth the money since i already planned to get it altered"
3.0,"Made well, good quality!"
3.0,"The material of this shirt is like a costumes and it doesn’t look how it looks in the photo. If you want a shirt that looks like a brandy shirt this is not for you. Though it does fit well and snug,probably would not buy again."
3.0,"She loved it , fit fine"
3.0,"I knew my tracker was fading but also needed a new band to get last bit of life out of it without spending a bunch on money. They work, stay secure but are short term, after about a month expect the elasticity to fade."
3.0,Not as comfortable as I thought they would be.
3.0,Very unflattering.  Dress for us people without curves.
3.0,"It is comfort, good quality and good price."
3.0,"Poor quality.. does not  form or shape  right..if the straps are in back, it would form or hold its form better"
3.0,received.
3.0,"Pretty dress. Under layer is fitted while over lay is flowy. The under layer material does not have any give so I had to have a seamstress take it out and actually add material to the side seams underneath just so I could breath comfortably. I bought it to my measurements so I'm not sure why the dress was so tight. I ordered a size 8, but they requested my exact measurements and wrote size 6 on the tag."
3.0,Your grandma may wear this style.
3.0,"This wallet was perfect! It had everything I needed: room for phone, all my cards, checkbook... It even had that peekaboo hole for your ID which surprisingly enough is so hard to find.<br />I loved having the wrist wrap/band. It was so convenient while running around with our toddler and baby. My favorite feature was the first thing to break.<br />This product came with a one year warranty. Perfect. Except its one of those products that start falling apart as soon as the warranty is up.<br />I do recommend this product, but I am not a handy, fix it kind of person so once something breaks, me fixing it looks worse so I need to buy a new one.<br />Again, this is a perfect wallet. I just wish it lasted longer than 1 1/2 years."
3.0,Same pattern as picture. Covered bra straps. Soft. Too tight around neck and chest. Not as flowy as I hoped.
3.0,These are a nice brown color but the material is thinner than I expected and like.
3.0,It’s really cute but really large. I wear a size 18 pant and it is super big around the waist and I have to tie it around twice. If you’re maybe like a size 20-22 then maybe it’ll fit but not anyone smaller than an 18 for sure
3.0,This was not what I expected.  I was not happy with the quality.
3.0,"I am short waisted, and this was too short waisted on me.  I liked the look but sent it back."
3.0,Very Pretty but too small! I gave them to my granddaughter.
3.0,It's a very cute top but overall for my body type here in the United States it's cut too small all over
3.0,"Very cute,  but the beads fall off Very easy making it fall apart."
3.0,"nice glasses but for narrow type of face.  It fits my kids better, looks too small for my face"
3.0,very thin material color is light beige
3.0,"Cute dress, fits perfectly but is very thin."
3.0,The fit was ok… I just am not a fan of the sleeves…it runs big as well
3.0,Not as pictured. The picture shows 4 different styles and I received only two different styles. They aren’t long enough.
3.0,Took forever to ship but good Dr's for how cheap it is. Very wrinkly
3.0,"It'll work, but I took two stars off for the poor production control. The mask was painted very sloppily. I'm sure most of them look like this one and the one pictures is the exception. Also definitely overpriced, but that's too be expected this close to Halloween"
3.0,The snaps aren't secured well to the beanie.  It came loose and fell off within a week.
3.0,It's a pretty nice hat but it did not came in the color I want it too. I thought the hat color was going to be dark nany blue with a dark red like it looks in the picture but instead it came in light blue and light red not what I wanted
3.0,"I ordered the wine red color, and it’s a little more brightly colored than I hoped. Will most likely be returning. Size smalls fit me perfectly but I’m the type of person who likes a little extra room so I went with a medium and I highly suggest going up a size. I am 5-4 120ish."
3.0,Love these shorts to hit the right length of Monday. Order a beige pair but think they must’ve been a different brand because the fit around the waist line was better on the other shots. Waist down these shots emails though I ordered my size based on the scale on the website. They were too tight around the waist and drawstring don’t adjust for a more comfortable fit
3.0,"The shirt seems nice. The material seems nice. It was stiched/sewn really well. For some reason, it accentuates all of the wrong parts of my body and it was not flattering at all considering the type of top it is. I wanted to give it a good rating, but it doesn't look as pictured and that's half of how you would judge clothing from an online source. The shirt I received didn't have as much of an A-line as the image for the product: mine was more of a straight/trunk shape and you could clearly see the outline of my bra and every last jelly roll when I sat down or hunched forward. I am average to athletic in build and you could see every last lump, even ones you didn't know you had. Even if you had a perfect body, this shirt would find a way to make you silly. I think if I received a shirt that was more flowy, then my review would have been different--- maybe. The material/fabric is not forgiving, I'm tellin' you. It might look perfect on a mannequin. You cannot have flesh and be human wearing this shirt. I'm sorry. It's a great shirt, just not for real people. If you decide to try this top, maybe get 1 size up."
3.0,The shoes looks chunky and according to my daughter it's heavy. I wanted to return the shoes but my daughter likes the shoes very much.
3.0,"It does it's job, but it's a little bit thinner and lighter than I thought it was going to be. Large enough for stuff in it, but the thickness of the metal I mean."
3.0,"While the optical quality is good, lenses tend to pop out."
3.0,These are the tights I pull out when everything else is dirty.  The material is thin and so don't provide my support.  I like to feel everything is held in place when I am working out and these don't feel or look that way.
3.0,Extremely tight.  I ended up giving it away as a gift
3.0,"Cute pants, decent material and stretchy. I like the style and the pants are form fitting. My ONLY problem with these is the zippers and right back pocket are just for looks and are NOT Functionable. I bought these because of the extra cargo pockets so if you are looking for extra pockets these pants are not the ones.<br /><br />Also, go one size larger than you would normally wear, as I feel these run small."
3.0,I'm a size 9.5 and should've ordered the large.  They seem nicely made and are a good value for the price.
3.0,"XXL but still fits tight, I normally feel comfortable in 1X sizes"
3.0,"I tend to like Miusol items and this dress does seem like it is good quality. The color is beautiful and exactly as described. However, where I have purchased Miusol items before in this size, this particular dress runs small. There is no stretch to this fabric, so if you have any bust at all it actually pulls the fabric and your arms forward giving you a sort of hunch-backed look. So order at least one size up, two is probably better."
3.0,"The gauges with the dangle are too front heavy and they hang funny in the ears, looking like they’re are always about to fall out making them impossible for me to wear. The rest of them are okay."
3.0,This is a cute little black dress but the top is shaped oddly so the straps don’t stay up and it’s kinda baggy.
3.0,"I'd give the bag itself 5 stars because of the size and all the pockets, but the color is different than what was shown on-line. I thought the color of &#34;Good Catch&#34; would be a purple/turquoise color, but it turns out to be baby blue and pink! It looks like a diaper bag so I returned it. I'd like to purchase another one in a different color but I'm a little wary."
3.0,"I love the size of this ring, but the turquoise on it looks very fake! I guess it’s ok for the price😉 I’m still going to rock it regardless!!!"
3.0,I like it but it doesn't work all that good.
3.0,"I like the charms, except I only received 50 instead of 60. So, the stars were deducted."
3.0,Was a little disappointed with the size for the price.
3.0,The top part sits kinda wierd and just doesn't look good. YMMV.
3.0,Beautiful watch. Pin fell out after my boyfriend wore it maybe 5x. He's attempting to fix on his own. I purchased 2 hopefully when my brother gets his it holds up better.
3.0,I got a size medium. The shorts fit but the top was super small…not for women who wear a size 36DD
3.0,Cute but smaller than I hoped for.
3.0,"These sunglasses are made for people with a small face.  I wore them for about 10 minutes and they gave me a headache.  The arms fit tight against the side of your head, and with the tension spring, tends to press tightly.  They also looked small on my face.  I sent these back and ordered the Serengeti Modugno with 66 millimeter lenses versus these that have 60 millimeter lenses.  I haven't received the Modugno yet, but watched a youtube video on them, and they should fit my face better."
3.0,Pretty but cheaply made. Thought they were tear drop/oval shaped. Nope. Cheap circular hoops that can be purchased from any retail store
3.0,This is a well made product.  It is just a bit too scratchy around my neck.
3.0,"super cute, wife loved it but the top was way too small. definitely did not fit a 36D."
3.0,"I'm a true medium; however when i received this dress, it did not fit at all..:( i was so sad I had to send it back because i really liked it."
3.0,"I am not sure of how I feel about this bag. I like that is seems sturdy double layer, reversible. I like the cause, despite arguments over how much actually makes it to the feed program. I like that this bag atleast raises the awareness of the cause and encourages use as alternative to plastic bags....<br /><br />But...I used the bag with burlap side out so that inside cotton straps are against my shoulder....and I get fuzzies from the entire exterior of bag all over my clothes.  If I reverse it to white side, the burlap side of straps are on my shoulder and is rough but also leaves burlap fibers all over my clothes too.  And then you get the burlap/rough side on inside so be cautious as you may get shedding fibers on whatever you store (if using as handbag). I haven't washed bag yet, but it seems that this may be the nature of burlap fabric even after washed?<br /><br />So, I am torn since one of my main needs was as a frequent use sack/bag and it is a pain to deal with the burlap fibers shedding.  Maybe just donate money directly to the World Food Program and get a cotton reusable sack?"
3.0,"There are quality control issues with this top which is not surprising considering the price.  I normally wear a small but ordered medium based on feedback.  Out of 6 shirts, 2 were a little looser than the others and one v neck had a smaller v than the others.  I wish I had ordered large even though I rarely wear larger than a small.  You get what you pay for and since they were so inexpensive it is not worth returning them.  They are nice and long."
3.0,"The tie looked amazing, just as it does online. The colors were bright and had a great silky feel. However, part of my order was missing. I did not receive the Pocket Liner. I'm very disappointed about that."
3.0,I don’t really like the fit but it’s okay
3.0,Fit is good.  As per size guide.  I use it for work.  Either dress down with black jeans or work trousers and heels
3.0,"It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but, again, it's alright and will work."
3.0,Very flattering but runs small
3.0,I found this color (red) for a deal (about ten off reg price) so I had to buy it. If it was full price would prob send back. It is very short (I’m 5’9”). Its perfectly acceptable as a swim coverup though.
3.0,"Was a little big for me, my granddaughter and I got pierce at the same time so I just pass the bigger ones on to her"
3.0,Nice first price seems a little high good sale price more in line for what the item quality
3.0,disappointed...quality and fit not as expected
3.0,"its good quality, looks real, and easy to see out of. however the size of the glasses are way to small, they would fit me perfectly if I was a dwarf or 5 th grader. they are good quality just not meant for big people."
3.0,The badge holder started to rip apart after only 1-2 months of having to partially stick my pudgy fingers in the slot to grab my card.  Still use the lanyard.
3.0,PUT SOFTER MORE NATURAL CUPS  OR REMOVABLE CUPS
3.0,"Larger than I had expected (and hoped for) but pretty enough, good price"
3.0,"Not the comfiest material. Tummy compression is good, but pinches my thighs at the bottom of the shorts"
3.0,"Not made very well, color is off, and it’s way larger than the size states."
3.0,The case was not what I expected.  It was missing the latch and the engraving was not as pretty as the picture depicted.
3.0,The quality very good but Samaller than I expected .can I return them to get bigger size ?
3.0,"My little boy (13 mo) and I love Pedipeds for his feet, and this pair is very cute. HOWEVER - three ""minuses,"" compared to other pedipeds:  1. Nubuck shows the wear very quickly and doesn't clean up easily; 2. Orange dye, when wet, comes off and discolors any fabric that it touches; 3. The hook-and-loop (""velcro"") patches were very small and not sewn on well -- the fuzzy part on the strap is okay, but both the shoe pieces ripped off, and I glued them back on with fabric glue, which may or may not last."
3.0,Love the pattern and the strechablity but i got a small and they are too big on my wrist so i’m unable to wear them
3.0,Very cute costume but the legs need to be longer so that walking can be done more comfortably.
3.0,I absolutely love this dress. However I am most likely going to return it. There is a visible design flaw on the front where the ink (or whatever) has bled. I attached a picture. It may not seem like a big deal but for me it’s all I see when I look down. I will order another one.
3.0,Color not as expected at all
3.0,"I ordered this dress, because there's a lot of reviews about how flattering this design is. This seller is the only one who had tgis type of dress in navy blue. However when I received the dress I was very disappointed. Color is way off. It's kind of dust blue. Fabric has some shine to it and it doesn't hide lines from bra on the back. However it's well made dress. But blue is not at all as seller represents."
3.0,I wish there was an option to use at least 2 different color lettering
3.0,"These rings were bigger than I hoped and stretched out quickly causing my vape device I bought them for to fall out several times. What I did like about them is the number of them you got for the money which is fortunate since they stretch out so quickly and easily.<br />I imagine if you had a larger vape device than a Novo 2 which seems to be an odd size for most rubber rings, these would be perfect. I was just disappointed because there was no size in between extra large and itty bitty.<br /><br />Also one of them already pulled through the loop part of the Ring that allows you to hang your rubber ring to whatever lanyard you have."
3.0,Love the design and there's a nice amount of pockets and card slots but the fabric has pulled about of the frame.
3.0,"It's a cute set I ordered for my coworker and myself. On one of the necklaces the red bulbs did not work at all, but other wise it was cute."
3.0,Says women's size but it fits more like a medium than a large. Super cute!
3.0,Not as expected  not a bad shirt just not my style  Other chiffon layered sheer much better
3.0,One tag fell off during travel had to put tape over snap closure to assure it would stay put.
3.0,Ordered shiny ended up with matte. Ear was bent in shipping so I used a blow dryer to flatten it out best I could. Excell for pictures but wouldn't be ideal to wear out for Halloween parties or anything.
3.0,Nice but the effort to get it on causes little pulls in the thread - maybe due to my finger nails. I'm 5 1'' with 8/8.5 feet and 14&#34; calves. Boy these squeeze my legs/calves. I couldn't keep them on for too long without the chevron print on my skin. I should maybe have taken a large but with time I bet the medium will relax. The foot fit is good. I bought for ankle veins but so tight on my leg that I'm not even sure how my ankle feels :S
3.0,too long and tighter fit below the waist
3.0,The excess fabric in the bodice is not attractive.
3.0,Great material but runs small!
3.0,The teeth of  bezel (the part you grip when turning) is not lined up with the insert markings. The finish on outer bezel looks like it was half done steel bracelet feels flimsy and scratchy .. just embarrassing to wear honeslty
3.0,"No era lo que esperaba, demasiado simple"
3.0,They fit fine and are comfortable; strangely they do very little for my physique. Everyone's different.
3.0,I loved them both so much .. I had to have for my daughter but after first wash armpit on one jacket ripped at seems …
3.0,Fits great and the size is not too big/small
3.0,"I love the bracelet, but the curved shape look more feminine.  Also, it yanks the !@#% out of my arm hair."
3.0,"Im 5'6 130lbs and a small feels a big baggy. The arm length/size is perfect, but the body is super baggy. Does not fit tight to the body like the picture shows, fits more like a baggy pull over hoodie.<br /><br />Maybe it will shrink a little after washing not sure."
3.0,I do like them a lot. The color is great the fit is good. It’s medium compression and I don’t get camel toe because no front seem. I will say I’ve worn them twice and washed once and it started to pill at the crotch so bad it’s got a tiny hole now. I imagine it will get bigger over time so not the most durable material. For the price can’t complain too much.
3.0,Keychain size. Looked bigger in the photo then actual size. Printed photo and sealed with plastic cover. Not completely satisfied.
3.0,They are definitely cheep. Some of the pearls were stuck together. Worked for the project I needed them for. Not a regular wear item.
3.0,"This cap is cool looking. Olive drab, nice fit, I could probably get away with wearing it off-bike in my hipster saturated enclave.<br /><br />But if you’re going on an actual ride, like more than 30 miles, just keep in mind this thing is cotton. It just absorbs sweat and does not dry. So your cap will just get sloggier and sloggier as your cycling day goes on.<br /><br />I decided to keep it for casual rides where I value looking cool and don’t need to worry about performance. Just don’t expect it to perform like the tech fabrics most cycling hats are made of."
3.0,It is nice but Buy at least two sizes bigger than normal
3.0,"These are cute, but plan on having green fingers, especially if you are sensitive. (Some of them look VERY cheap, while a couple looked really adorable!)"
3.0,"Not the best fit. Top big, bottom small. Creeps up often"
3.0,I sent it back because it wasn’t exactly what I wanted. It is pretty though
3.0,"While these helped clear up the dents and irritation on moms nose, they caused the glasses to sit farther off her face and keep the arms from being able to reach behind her ear where they belong. Couldn't adjust the nose pads enough to accommodate the thickness of the pad covers. Will get new nose pads instead."
3.0,"I liked this shirt enough to keep it. I would've sized down if I'd known to do so, however. Here are the...<br />PROS:<br />Great color!! Super cute.<br />Nice, soft fabric that drapes well.<br />Sleeves and shirt overall are LONG ENOUGH. I am just 5'8"" but it's so hard to find shirts that are long enough, especially in the sleeves!<br />Definitely easy pull aside for nursing.<br />CONS:<br />I am 175 lbs, and wear a large in tops. I bought a large, and wish I'd gotten medium.  It fits... it's just very loose. It gapes a little around the stomach, which isn't super flattering.  As you can tell from the pictures it has a lot of extra fabric at the stomach, would fit a pregnant belly perfectly.<br />SUMMARY:<br />Cute and functional, but size down unless you're getting it for pregnancy or have a larger stomach."
3.0,The shirt was just okay.  Tried it on and it was too small for me.  Not going to reorder.
3.0,"Love this lavender color,  the fit is just ok. I ordered XL and it's a bit more fitted than I like across the chest. I usually wear a L or xl. I like to take these lightweight full coverage items for travel but this one is not wrinkle free. Even after laundering, and hanging to dry it's still very wrinkled. When I put it on the seam had a whole in it. I will mend it and keep but only because I love the color and can't find this lavender in another style."
3.0,"Not a good fit for a pear shape. I typically wear a size large top (12-14) and XL bottom (14-16). I went with a size large for these pajamas expecting the pants to be a little roomy (most people want roomier, comfy jammies). Instead, they were such a straight, tight fit, I was worried I would bust the seam in the seat! And simultaneously, the top was too big! Ordering an XL, the pants could have possibly fit better if they weren't too long, but I would have been drowning in the top. The top is also stretchy, but the fabric of the bottoms have no give."
3.0,Nice dress but fit too small. Keeping it as incentive for losing weight.
3.0,"Good looking shoe for the price. No arch support. Very narrow heel. Good for wearing, not good for exercise."
3.0,"I haven't trained in these yet, but I'll tell you my experience from trying them on.<br /><br />The velcro closure system is super-elaborate. So much so, that Century even has a video posted about how to use it. Once you fasten these, you're pretty much locked in. They have a bunched elastic area on the left and right sides of the waist, which is kind of odd and totally unneeded since the closure has these on lockdown on your waist already. Supposedly all this extra hoopla is so your shorts won't come loose when rolling or grappling. I've never really had that problem with the standard closures of other shorts anyway. Hope you don't have pee really bad all of the sudden with these on, because it's a chore to get them undone!<br /><br />The shorts are not as long as they appear here, however they aren't running-short short either. I do wish they were ever so slightly longer. The colors are super-cool and I love that more and more manufacturers are making woman-specific shorts. They are true to size - I wear a 6, ordered 6, and it fits. I'll come back and update once I've worn them for training."
3.0,the legs are still to small. not as proportionate as it should be
3.0,"There’s stretch and the material is as expected.  I ordered a 3XL and it buttons up snug and is on the shorter side in length.  Because of the cut, it looks weird left unbuttoned, so I just can’t wear it.  The sleeves is plenty roomy though, which surprised me.  I’m regularly a size 20 and not large busted, so it has nothing to do w my chest.  I’m disappointed.  Every other too I order is 3XL for the larger feel and this one barely huttons."
3.0,This bracelet has some charm to it but it it will break very fast. In my case I just created a new bracelet out of the broken one and it looks awesome. Otherwise it would be in the garbage can after second time I've worn it because it fell apart.
3.0,"I love the color and size. It's not tight on my larger calves. However, other reviews were correct: it is itchy even when worn over thin leggings."
3.0,"Need a bigger size, they run small. Liked price, constructed good"
3.0,Purse sinks in.  Shows every mark.
3.0,"Very nice looking watch, however when it arrived the battery it came with was already dead. There was no protector between the watch and battery. So now I have to go and buy a new battery for this watch."
3.0,"too small for americans, wasted my $"
3.0,These bras are beautiful and fit very well but the double push up is just too much padding for my likes. I wanted a regular push up bra! I'll know from now on!
3.0,My grand daughter
3.0,Cute dress. But runs small
3.0,"These earrings are very cute. They're light weight and they don't pull on my earlobes. I like the little hinge on them that allows them to open easily, but they're very difficult to latch closed. In fact, I find it nearly impossible to do so when putting them on, but really easy when I'm holding them and can look at it while doing so."
3.0,Top fit tight but it’s a cute outfit
3.0,It broke the first day I got it but after fixing it myself it has held up rather well since.
3.0,Too small for adult and pump kept falling off
3.0,"I was looking for something as an alternative to my bulky wallet.  I decided to try this minimalist aluminum slim wallet by ROCO and to sum it up I am not that impressed by it.  What arrives are two aluminum sleeves that are held together by a thick rubbery band (2 bands are provided).  First, I do like the brushed dark aluminum appearance of the sleeves.  I do think it looks nice and unique.  The apparent RFID blocking ability of this slim wallet is definitely a likable feature.  Unfortunately those 2 are the only things I truly like about this wallet.  The elasticity of the band is not good at all.  It is quite stiff and makes it rather difficult to place on or take off from the wallet.  Although I guess this would be good if you were paranoid that your stuff might fall out of it (it won't).  The stiffness leads me to another thing I don't like about the wallet, in that it is only truly functional for cards and ID.  I would not recommend placing any cash in here because it will be extremely tough to get out and hell of a lot more of a pain to put in.  Even having cards in here are not that great because the more cards you put in, the more the band constricts and restricts making it challenging to possibly pull that one card you want to use.  Overall I think this ok if you plan on just carrying an ID and 1 or 2 cards but thats about all I would recommend using it for.  I don't think this would be good for daily use to replace the various things you may keep in your wallet (cash, insurance cards, other papers, etc...).<br />I would like to acknowledge that I received this product to test at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. This does not influence my opinion about the product. I do my best to offer an unbiased and practical review from a neutral and &#34;every day&#34; person's perspective. I hope you found this helpful."
3.0,I love the product. But as all ways no instructions!!!
3.0,To me these masks are very small.
3.0,The bottoms are super cheeky but the bathing suit is very comfortable
3.0,"I like the qaulity for the price, yet the size is way too off. I ordered X-Large and it is like Mediam. I wanted to return it but they didn't have XXL. So if you are ordering, order twice of your size."
3.0,The cardigan was small and also somewhat see through. Disappointing.
3.0,The sandal was not cut to fit your average medium foot so my opinion it was not cut true to size is cut on the smaller side
3.0,🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
3.0,I had to return them they run small.
3.0,"They’re good, not as shiny as the picture, and the little charm that’s supposed to have the female and male symbols were just blank circles. Cute enough for a Valentine’s gift. They’re also bigger than I had anticipated. I had thought they were like nickel sized, but they’re more like those old 50 cent coins sized. Mine broke, BUT it was because my aunt tried to lift my 15 pound bag from it, so yeah. They weren’t scratched or anything when they arrived. Arrived in good time as well."
3.0,This bathing suit runs on the small size for plus size women. However when i received this suit the strings on the side of the bottoms was out of where it was supposed to be and I can not get it to go back. I don't think that  the bottoms being held by tied strings is a good option for anyone. The suit is super cute and the material seems to be made of good material and not cheap. Just ran on the small side for me. I may try to find a navy blue bottom that will match.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased opinion.
3.0,"This was almost perfect for what I was looking for, the only problem is that the mask doesn't go down very far on my neck, so I had to augment it with a black sock around my neck to hide the little sliver between the mask and the shirt I was wearing. The photo has a guy in a collard shirt completely covered, but it definitely wont stay that way. You can stretch it down but as you walk it rides up a little and your neck will be exposed. A turtle neck would probably fix the problem.<br />Otherwise, great product. It was relatively easy to see and breath through, but made my face look hollow and empty in my Witch King of Angmar helmet."
3.0,"The length is perfect but overall they are pretty poor quality, I had to sew the straps back onto 2 of the tops. Also the straps are really wide set in the back."
3.0,"Nice, breezy, inexpensive dress to wear when you're in a rush. Def not tailored fit (had strings hanging from hem). Overall, good enough...blah"
3.0,"I returned this shirt because the dark pink I was looking for was more like a maroon red. I was a little larger than the xxl I was expecting, an xl would have been perfect"
3.0,Received it before expected time great quality
3.0,This came very small. Might be good for a child. No clasp but woven. Beautiful bracelet.
3.0,"I'll update after use, but this just came and I want to warn people.  With the watch face, this measures 8 inches - unstretched.  The stretch is rather tight as you pull it on, but then it's too big.  My wrist is 6.5 &#34;  and I'd say this watch will be too big up to 7+ inches. It says &#34;standard woman's&#34; size, but I can slip my thumb between my wrist and the band.<br />Too bad, as I'd like every color."
3.0,"Material is very thin, like a cheap Haloween costume.  Bow tie is actually more of a peachy cream color, not cream like the photo.  Very tight on arms and chest.  I ordered a medium, which is the size I wear in all my clothes.  This dress runs small.  I’m returning it, unfortunately.  The material is so thin and cheap."
3.0,Beautiful color. Nice material. Runs insanely small. Nowhere near accurate US sizing. I typically wear a large but bought an XL for a roomy fit. It felt more like a medium. I had to return it. Order a size or two up.
3.0,Pretty earrings but there is nothing that says Oscar de larenta on them or the package
3.0,"Love the print. Runs big so I'd recommend sizing down. Material is a little itchy, hoping it will soften up after a few washes."
3.0,Ferrari watch a real nice piece. Got the piece Dead ! Packing was damaged ! What would you think ?
3.0,"Overall great, con: the sleeves are way too short. I’d say at least 1 1/2 inches. Warm enough for the blistering is winds!"
3.0,These were to small for me which broke my heart because I loved the pattern. The material was good quality.
3.0,"I am an adult, but I have a small head, so this older child sized product is perfect... my one disappointment was that the shearling fleece is only on the ear parts, not lining the whole hat. It would be way warmer with fleece lining it, it's kind of a t-shirt material on the inner hat."
3.0,"This ring discolored and started turning my finger green after about 3 months of daily wear. I am a nurse. so I wash my hands all day long. Maybe that is why I didn't have good luck with it. i gave it 2 stars because it was pretty at first, and I only paid $10 for it, so I wasn't expecting the best quality anyways."
3.0,Materials a little thin and too long
3.0,Top of suit runs small an there is not much support for the breast.
3.0,"This fit true to size (I bought 'M'),  fit me like boy shorts (I'm 5'4""), looked great on, has a built-in-underwear so is both comfortable and decent to wear (especially after becoming wet), and stayed put even after spending hours in the rough ocean waves. I even wore this atop a one piece swimsuit to a casual beach-side restaurant, so you can imagine that it provides decent coverage in public outside of the beach or swimming pool and will probably look like regular shorts to the naked-eye... but I was going scuba diving afterward so needed to be able to both comfortably and quickly change into my diving suit and these shorts were great for that... I wouldnt normaly wear them so casually in non-beach or pool outings.<br /><br />Anyway. On to why I had to take off two stars... as you can see from the pictures, it basically got stained after the first time i used this at the beach! Presumably from the finely sanded beach I went to, so that is a huge bummer. It progressively got stained more and more with each use at the beach, but on the plus-side the underwear largely did not take to as much staining as the actual shorts did... not sure why, but maybe it's a different or superior quality to the shorts? It's totally useless to me now, and I wont be wearing the pair I have, but the reason i'm still giving this three stars is because i'm assuming this stain won't happen if you're planning to wear it in the pool rather than the beach."
3.0,Changing  in a 1/2 size went from sloppy fit to tight.
3.0,If only it was correctly!!
3.0,This dress is cute for summer time with sandals. It runs a little small. Light weight material. The color is bright pink and pretty.
3.0,Unfortunally it was too big but it seems cute
3.0,"I'm not sure where all the 5 star reviews are from, but I just received mine, and I guess tell you... It's just ok.<br /><br />First what I like about it.<br />1, lightweight. Some reviews said it felt heavy but IMO it's pretty light. Better go to the gym guys<br />2. I totally dig the tritium tubes. Unlike anything I've had before as they stay lit the entire night. That was the main reason for the purchase, so I got what I wanted<br /><br />Scratching my head cons.<br /><br />1. I really feel like if I accidentally bump this watch into anything hard, that the links are going to burst and the glass will crack like an old iPhone<br /><br />2. The band is not steel. It's more of a soft aluminum. This baby is going to scratch easily, so over time, my watch will be black with a lot of silver scratch lines<br /><br />3. This watch is not sapphire. I've owned a few pure sapphire glass watches. This is engineered sapphire that will scratch and break much easier than real sapphire. Deceiving imo.<br /><br />4. This watch does Not scream luxury. At least  in the color scheme of white numbers on black. Looks like a cheap toy watch that I had as a kid. But this is my opinion.<br /><br />5. The clasp as another reviewer said, is a poor design and a pain to connect at times<br /><br />6. The luminosity, although I dig that it stays luminated all night...it is dim as others have said<br /><br />All in all... I'm keeping it while looking forward to breaking it as a lesson learned and getting a Ball or something if better quality. I would say there are 100+ better watch choices in the $100 range. Just my opinion take it for what it's worth"
3.0,"This is cute, but torso is a bit long and overall larger than expected"
3.0,It became dark grey quickly.
3.0,"The black headband fits perfect, the white is way too tight and definitely not the same as the black one."
3.0,Very thin not good quality vs other scarfs I purchased
3.0,Good eye relief but a little difficult to put on glasses when wearing them.
3.0,Way too big for an American size 12 in girls.  Good thing we have safety pins and this is only for a Halloween costume.  Material is great and sturdy.
3.0,"Fits as described, strange pleat in front and back. Very wrinkled"
3.0,This shoe was too big and the liner came out after only one use.
3.0,"The quality of the product is ""OKAY"" - stitching is a bit off on the decal on the front of the shirt.  I should also mention that the tag was sewn to the exterior of the garment rather than inside it.  Even if you cut it off, you can see a portion of it sticking out.  The stitching of the applique is a bit messy and not clean but I only paid 9.99 for it so I didnt expect much. The fabric seems to be cotton which is decent material wise.  The first shipment I got was actually women's camisoles an not the product I ordered so I had to complain to have the right item sent to me.  It's okay for a season and a few washes at most."
3.0,Was a little too snug and ripped during the first wear. Cute hat though!
3.0,"I got the cream color and you can see through it, so I'll have to find a slip to go under."
3.0,"The colors aren't as pictured, for a moment I thought I received the wrong print. It fits really well though, very flattering and forgiving."
3.0,"No size giving in description  very tiny.  Not to impressed,"
3.0,I love the style but it’s way too small I’m returning for a refund.
3.0,"These were much thinner than I expected. I wanted something to keep the sweat out of my eyes when exercising, but these seem to be more suited for just holding your hair back. They're not what I would call &#34;Sporty&#34; at all."
3.0,"I really wanted these and I had hoped they would improve viewing on my laptop computer and tablet.  I was wrong.  I don't know what the issue is, but looking at the pages of a book or magazine is fine with this set.  However, the reason for only 3 stars, looking at my computer screen or table, something is off, not right with how I see.  You would think (at least I did) that if they work for viewing paper, books, or magazines they would do as well with a computer screen.  They don't.<br /><br />So, sorry to say, if you are planning to use these with computer or tablet, I would recommend something else.  However, if you only use these for paper reading, like a book or magazine, these will work fine. These are the +3.0 power.  Maybe the lessor powers will work better?"
3.0,The gem fell out the second day I had them in. Very cheaply made.
3.0,"Necklace came in as advertised. My daughter loved it. Looks great for the price. Unfortunately, the chain portion of the necklace seemed rigid and inflexible to the touch and sure enough, as she was trying to straighten out a kink in the chain it snapped. Looks like we'll need to buy a better quality chain for the turquoise pendant."
3.0,Nice jacket but I ordered an x-large and received a medium so I returned it.
3.0,"For a cheaper pair of sunglasses, these held up well for me. I lose a lot of sunglasses, so they were great for me."
3.0,This is a lovely dress. However my frame is quite small so this dress fits very large and long. If they ever produce this in xs I will consider buying another.
3.0,This was too small.  I am disappointed.  I am not going to return it.  I will donate it to charity.
3.0,"3 Stars,only because you cannot see the stone on the side (only from the back ridge along your ear. The cuff is beautiful and the quality is good."
3.0,"I purchased two of these skorts last summer and loved them so much I decided to get two new colors this summer.  The waste band on this years skirts are a poor design... they are flat, wide, tight elastic on the front with gathered elastic on the back ... whereas last years had the gathered elastic on the back with a flat, draw string waistband on the front.  The wide, flat elastic bands folds in the middle and are too tight for comfort ... and the skirts ARE NOT too small.  The shorts underneath are tighter and binding and also tend to roll up.<br />I do love the colors, length and side pockets ... just wish they had the same waste band as last years version."
3.0,I thought this sweater was going to be slouchy and oversized like shown in the photos.. unfortunately it is not. It’s shorter that. Expected and the sleeves are not as ballooned… super bummed about that. I feel like to get it to look like the picture I would have had to size up at least 2 sizes.. the color is spot on though and super cute for fall.
3.0,"I read to size up and I wish I hadn't, this top is already loose and baggy and I weigh about 100 lbs, size small would have been perfect. Unless you have a huge chest in proportion to the rest of your body, I would stick to your normal size for sure. This top would be super flattering on somebody with more body mass than myself, if you are heavier I would highly recommend this top, it is beautiful."
3.0,cute they do run a little big and slide down throughout the night i have thick thighs and big calves and they look nice on my legs
3.0,I love the hat but will not be able to wear it as it is to small. I’m hoping I can find someone in my family who likes it.
3.0,"I think I might have to return these.  Even though they are XXL, they barely fit me so i know they won't work for my husband. We will see on Christmas."
3.0,good fit- colors not true to the picture much brighter .
3.0,Returned because fit was just not right.  Seems to curve out or bow rather than sitting on top of prescription glasses frames.
3.0,Great level of compression. The socks are too thick for me. My feet get too hot after wearing them for a 12 hour shift at the hospital.
3.0,I was so hoping this would fit. The top is more like a small on me.
3.0,"The earrings are beautiful. I would have given a rating of, but they are mismatched. One string in the earring dangles longer than the others, and gives a different look. The pearls are very nice though."
3.0,Only downside to this product is the sizing.  I have small wrists and hands.... there isn't a way to adjust the chain around your finger and the wrist chain doesnt allow much for reducing the extra length around your wrist.
3.0,"I think this bathrobe is nice and soft, but it seems it will never stop losing lint in the dryer, and on your body when you use it! probably worth 20$."
3.0,"Love the pendant,  but the clasp keeps breaking.  Will be putting it on a new chain."
3.0,Shirt size kids 9-11 fits just fine for boys size 8-10. Just hang dry.  Only issue is the laser light.  The lanyard it comes attached to is defective.  It cannot be worn around his neck as it came with 2 open ends 🤦‍♀️
3.0,"Nice style and decent material but way too long. Like, weirdly long. Much longer than advertised in the product photos. Too long for a six-foot male."
3.0,"The print is beautiful, and I love how flows the fabric is, but I found a snag on the front of the dress before I ever wore it. I ordered a replacement and there was a snag in a different place on that one, too!"
3.0,"Loved the style, but too tight at ankles.Had to return them."
3.0,Cheap sunglasses maybe they'll last a few weeks. They look nice.
3.0,"Cute but cheap, but I’m not complaining for the price. They’ll hold just fine if you don’t get too rough😂😉"
3.0,"These are almost sunglasses (Too dark).<br />I have not used them because of this - in the picture they are not as dark as they are in reality. Fit is also not super comfy...<br />Good for outdoor use maybe, but not what I was looking for."
3.0,A little small especially at bottom.
3.0,Buckel is very hard to use.
3.0,"First, this shirt is made of seersucker, which is a lightweight puckered fabric, and not what I expected. Second, and this is my bad because I didn't look closely at the rear view, it buttons down the back; it's very difficult for me to button something down the back due to arthritus. Third, as mentioned in other reviews, it is very long; I'm 5'6"" and it is mid thigh on me. Last, I believe the one I received has been returned.  I really wanted to like this shirt, but it had too many strikes against it, so I'm returning it."
3.0,"I ordered this dress in RED and in ROSE RED. The RED was really cute and made of a nice, soft fabric. Highly recommend it. The ROSE RED is terrible - a stiff, synthetic cheap fabric and smaller fit. I don’t recommend the “rose red” at all."
3.0,"I want to love this, and it will do for now, but it does not fully cover your chest, even on my 10 year old. If you have no boobies you might be able to use this, or if you don't need protection up top. We will be using this for art and I've ordered something else for cooking/gardening so I have protection in the chest area. The plus is that this is very cute and very light weight, it does fully encircle your body on the lower half and has long strings and big pockets. It's a bit scratchy when removed from package but after the first wash it is lovely and airy. The cost is also very nice. If you can sew, you could order 2 and convert one into a waist only apron and use the top fabric to extend the panels on either side of the top, which is something I am still considering since I like everything else about this. For reference I am 5' 4"" and wear a medium top."
3.0,"This bra is very nice but it's not comfortable, I didn't like the fit."
3.0,"The size is more of a large purse/work-bag than a duffel bag, although it works for either.<br /><br />It has six pockets, which for me just means it takes up to 6x as long to find my keys, phone, earbuds, whatever. I hate a ton of pockets and wish they would stop making them--especially deep ones you have to dig around in forever, getting scratched by velcro on the way up (only one pocket is velcro. Three are zippered, and two are open-top.)<br /><br />My main complaint about this bag, though, is the painful straps. I bought it to accommodate my purse essentials as well as a few things for work (iPad, snacks, water bottle). It's the right size for those things, but simply too painful and can't be used as such. You feel every ounce tugging on your shoulder, shifting and chafing. Better for carrying light clothing I guess (as an overnight bag).<br /><br />I will say it is pretty heavy-duty and water-resistant, though, which is nice. If you spill something in one section, for example, it may not penetrate and ruin all the contents of the bag. Damage will remain mostly contained. Or if you set it someplace wet or damp, it won't necessarily soak through (although I'm sure there are limits.)"
3.0,The suit is really nice don’t expect the best fabric but it’s still pretty good but the mask it came with was cheaply made I recommend buying one separately
3.0,"Looks fantastic.  Very flexible, so 0 foot support.  No mid- or heel- rigidity or elastane.  My 12 yr old said they are ""decent."" He got ankle blisters 1st wear, but he had not broken them in."
3.0,"So this dress was really a disappointment when I first received it. Its kinda big/shapeless and the material is pretty cheap. Also it is a bit scratchy due to the stars that are glued on.<br />The way this dress is cut will make you look frumpy, it looks gorgeous on tiny people but on me and anyone that isn’t a xs it can make you look 10 lbs more.<br /><br />However, I found a way to really make this dress cute, I cropped the inner layer and it looks so much better! Also a belt is mandatory! It will really give it some shape. Make sure to wear a strapless black or nude bra with a slip or shorts under because it is sheer.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Maybe. If you have the time to fit and style it. Also be aware that it can look very costume, so having a bold style is necessary to make this work.<br /><br />Its a stylish piece and I’m glad to have it but quality is bad for the price."
3.0,"I like the design and it is a VERY deep bag, however, very heavy bag."
3.0,I am a medium slim fit and that was to small
3.0,This product has perfect reviews so I had really high hopes for it. The white is not functional since it is see through (see first pic) the fabric over the torso is just too thin. I am 5’2 and 115lbs and got the small. It fit really well over my legs and bum but I think the top is meant for people with a larger chest (I’m a 34C for reference). The fabric scoops weird around the neckline because of this. The bottom side of the built in bra also hits way past the bottom of my boobs so there is no support at all. Again—probably better for big boobs. I felt like this dress was the perfect length for a petite/short person. If they had size xs it might be perfect.
3.0,I love the holiday theme and light breathable fabric
3.0,I don’t rly have a small nose and the just looked very wide and the actual wire was very long so if you bent it the ring would cover your lip. However it was a good way for me to decide if I still want a septum(I do). Also they were pretty good quality
3.0,"Material is very thin, otherwise it fits as expected and is comfy."
3.0,"So I know it's my fault for not reading better, but this is not 18kt gold plated like it says in description on top. If you look further down it's just some hypo allergenic/nickel free stuff. Not suitable for a gift in my opinion"
3.0,too small，
3.0,Looks nothing like the photo. I was weary about the product but thought i would give it a shot because i could use new work clothes at a decent price. Just got delivered today and i disliked it as soon as i opened the package. Way off on color. Material is like rayon which i hate with any clothing. And it doesnt fit right. At first i thought it was the wrong order and realized i was just mislead by a description. Never wearing this. Unflattering by all means. 3 stars because of fast shipping. Thats about it.
3.0,For a 3x the shirt fits like an xlarge  The print is nice
3.0,I purchased this item as a gift for my mother who loved it. Good product
3.0,"Did not like, inthought they were mirrored,  but are flat black lenses"
3.0,I found that the sizing was off enough that I'll need to stretch the sweaters so that they are not tight. Also worry that they will shrink in the wash. They are pretty...just wish that they fit better.
3.0,Feel really cheap but I can see just fine.
3.0,Coat is very cute but arrived very crumpled and folded in a small plastic mailing bag.  I had to take it to the cleaners to have it pressed before I could wear it.
3.0,"The fit is nice, so I'll hang on to it, but I wasn't expecting polyester."
3.0,"It’s okay, but I ended up buying a little wider set of 3 silicon bands and they looks a lot better. Good thing these bands are affordable."
3.0,"Shirt was extremely small by US standards, but I was able to give it away as a gift---which worked out ok."
3.0,"Ordered a size bigger based on reviews.  Bottoms fit just right, top was way too small.  I'm a size 6 with DD chest so I often have this problem."
3.0,"The rings are small on my fingers but, make good middy rings. Also some of the jewels fall off, and the color comes off in some spots as well."
3.0,"I like it, I am just not as comfortable working out in it"
3.0,If you order go up at least 2 sizes. Good graphics but shipping takes forever
3.0,So many of these had the plastic missing or coming off leaving damage on the product.
3.0,"Beautiful sweater, however it's too long for my frame. Have tried their size small items and also too long for me."
3.0,"Not quite as nice as the picture. The worst part is that it was shipped in a small, thin bubble mailer. It was broken into multiple pieces when I received it."
3.0,I like this style.but it’s very thin.just like a sheet of paper.good fit for five year old kids.
3.0,"Not a lot of stretch, and it's too tight for me to wear, but it does look and feel warm. This is more generous with the fabric than most of these bands are."
3.0,Cute bodysuit but was much too big.  I would order a size down. Good customer service for returns though
3.0,Decent looking product but definitely not a medium.  Be careful of sizing.
3.0,"This fits little bit large for me but it's good for casual golf outfits. The clothe of it is very thin so it's better to wear it on a sunny day. If I wear it on a windy day, it will make me uncomfortable as skirt will be fluttering."
3.0,Bit too long I gave it away
3.0,"I ordered this HaloVa Backpack, Mini shoulder bag for my wife.  It is very light weight.  Although this can be a double edge sword because it does not feel sturdy or high quality.  The fabric isn't itchy or scratchy but it feels a little cheaply made.  The ""Jack"" on the back is convenient to thread through headphones, but most are Bluetooth now so I am not sure it is a great added benefit.  It is a good size if you travel light or only need your wallet and a few items.  I am not quite sure about the durability, but will update my review after my wife uses it for a few months.<br /><br />It does sit comfortably on the shoulder.  Because it is smaller you are not tempted to fill it full of lots of stuff, so it maintains a lighter weight on the shoulder.  It is really not a bad bag for the price, it just isn't a great bag for the price."
3.0,Super long like a pregnancy belly ring. Didn’t fit well.
3.0,"They are nice and comfortable but that's it, the heat works but I can't feel it on my feet. Meaning I only feel the heat when I touch them with my hands. The comfort is great but, I need more warmth!"
3.0,Great helmet so far. SMALLER THAN EXPECTED. Lightweight and you can see great out of it. Would reccomend one size up.
3.0,Bought this for my son who needed to wear a Mickey shirt for a school project.  Bad mommy waited til last minute so Amazon prime saved the day but the quality of the shirt was disappointing.  Not soft. Like<br />Card board.
3.0,"Pretty, but not structured enough. The material it heavy enough but not exactly what I wanted"
3.0,"No tan comodo, mas bien siento que esta como pequeña.<br />La tela es un poco dura, aspera. Lindo el color y liviana a la vez."
3.0,"Broke after wearing once, but was able to fix it"
3.0,"4’11” - 120 lb. - Love the boots, perfect heel height.  Purchased 6.5 as always.  Wearing around house & find my heel slips in these boots (w/socks)  Too wide in heel,  but  rounded toe allows foot room.  Imagine they will stretch as they are leather.  Plan to try a size 6, other than that I will just give these boots an okay as far was fit goes.  Great style!  Would suggest more arch support."
3.0,The hat looks better in the pictures than it is in real life. It still works just the colors are slightly off.
3.0,I needed a cheap cool maxi dress for the walk from the hospital to the car after having my baby. The material is a little bit thin but that made the South Carolina July heat much less intense
3.0,"i was looking for a duffel bag and decided to purchase this one. it's medium in size...will definitely fit in the overhead bin with EXTRA room. doesn't hold much if youre going away for more than the weekend. there's no protection on the bottom so tossing it casually on the ground is not recommended. overall, its a good bag...not THE duffel bag i though i was buying."
3.0,Love the skirt but the waists is snug. The rest of the skirt has lots of room. I'm going to try to fix the elastic so I can wear it. The color is beautiful.
3.0,Doesn't look exactly like the picture.
3.0,For the price its a good buy.. but it's kind of cheap material. To be expected though.
3.0,The only problem I had with this top is that shoulders are put together differently.
3.0,"The colors were bright and the dress looked nice but I can’t say it was very comfortable. The netting is a nice touch to add some fullness but it sits directly against your legs which is very uncomfortable and itchy. They fabric is polyester and the seams were itchy as well. The chest area is also fairly small so the waist sat just barely under my chest, though I am larger chested. Nice dress for looks but not so nice for comfort."
3.0,"Nice looking watch, but very light and flimsy. Not as heavy as it looks. Keeps good time so far, but only time will tell (pun intended). Gives instructions on how to set date, yet there is NO date function on the watch. I give it 6 months, TOPS, before it winds (pun intended) in the trash can. Flashy, but trashy!"
3.0,My daughter said it really hurts where the button is.
3.0,"update：some panty has come unstitched……just wash 2～3 times.poor quality.<br /><br />Just choose your regular size！！I'm 5'3,130lb<br />Size 6 will fit perfect."
3.0,"This is of great quality. My boyfriend is a diehard Cowboys fan and he loved the look of it. However, if you are going to put more than a few dollars in it, you will be disappointed. It doesn't expand very easily at all."
3.0,"The royal blue color is not the deep royal as pictured, it's a lighter royal blue."
3.0,Cheapy looking. Wrinkles difficult to remove.
3.0,"This is a beautiful watch, bigger than I thought it would be, which made me happy. The back light works very well, the shine/glitter it has is beautiful, it doesn't look like too much. It is easy to put on and take off, perfect for workouts. The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that the lifespan of the rubber pieces at the end of the band is Very short and you have no way of getting a replacement, because they are not sold separately. I took mine off and I wear the watch with no rubbers at the ends, its not that ugly you cant even tell actually. All the same Im happy with my purchase, I would recommend it."
3.0,"it was just to small, was a nice leather"
3.0,It was really beautiful and delicate but apparently not made very well. The clasp fell apart within one day of having it. Could also be a little looser. Otherwise it really was pretty.
3.0,"Super comfy, good fit, look cute. However for high-waisted tights they do nothing in the slimming department. I'm usually a size 6, average/athletic build, but I have a mommy-pooch. So without compression, these just accentuate the pooch since they come up over it. But you can fold the top over a bit to help the waist sit in a more spot. Anyway, will keep!"
3.0,"Doesn’t stay on head, needs a wider band."
3.0,"Pretty colors, but looks cheaply made."
3.0,The beads were pretty cool but the bracelet was loose. I threw a ping pong ball with the same hand and the bracelet flew off my wrist and shattered on the ground leaving beads everywhere
3.0,"I normally wear a 33 waist and with my shape a relaxed fit jean seems to fit me best. I so ordered the 34X32 HB's thinking the extra inch will help accomodate the hip pads. Well when I got the jeans I found that even without the hip pads it was to tight around the hips and upper thighs and butt. It fit well around the waist, lower thighs and legs and accommodated the knee pads without issue. Inseam length was good as well. But I had to return it. I then order the 36X32 instead. Well just got them and while the its actually a bit big at the waist, its nothing a belt or even a alteration couldn't fix. Its also not bad at the hips now. However its now huge in the butt and huge in the thighs and legs. Certainly no problem accommodating the knee guards and hip pads but I look like I am swimming in the jeans. Also the inseam seems to be a 34 rather than a 32 because they are way to long compared to the other ones. So I am returning them as well. Guess HB's are just not for me.<br /><br />I will say that the build quality seems to be good. Demin seems nice. Appearance is good.  I like the way they blended the horizontal stitchs that go across the knees to hold the knee guard pockets. They used a dark blue thread that makes the stitch almost invisible. Makes it look like there isn't stitching there making it a pretty stealthy motorcycle jean. The material they used for the regular pockets and knee and hip pockets is a plaid material, think Al Borlin from Home Improvement. Seems pretty durable but kind of odd choice of fabric considering you never see that when wearing them. If they only improved the cuts it would be a homerun jean. I am giving it 3 stars for its build quality and great price but it loses two for what appears to me to be inconsistent sizing.<br /><br />UPDATE: I tried a another brand of similar motorcycle pants and ran into the same issue. I've determined that the fit issue that I had with the HB's and the other brand I just tried is that they are cut with a seat thats more akin to a regular fit jean than a relaxed fit jean so unless you have a reasonably flat butt these jeans may not fit you, unless you buy them a few sizes larger but then they will look like clown pants. :D"
3.0,"This sweater  looks just as advertised and would be great on a tall, skinny frame. I am 5'6&#34; and 150 pounds and the sweater just looks sloppy and dowdy on me, not cute and slouchy-hip like on the model. But the fit is comfy (x-large) so I kept it to to wear at home. The fabric is a bit scratchy. If I had tried this on in a store I doubt that I would have bought it."
3.0,"its good quality, fitted for someone with a large head. doesnt fall as it does in the picture, looks better cuffed."
3.0,"The material is warm but the velcro is harsh and the cap keeps rotating sideways every time my baby turns his head into the stroller. Have to adjust it multiple times on each ride out. Plus, I do feel that the front area, from the forehead should be a little more open to make it a better fit. The way it is right now, the velcro cannot be fully tightened. I'm going to be looking for a better cap. Mitten's are okay though. No complaints there"
3.0,"Very cheap but do the trick. The paint will come off very quick. Also, they are a little small for adults. My hair is pretty thick and very curly so I don’t feel pressure on my head from these but I can definitely say someone with thinner hair would feel it. I bought those two months ago and still use them everyday."
3.0,They seem impractical because so bulky. It advised they should fit tight and expand over time. I had been afraid they might be too small
3.0,"This top is a pretty top and I like its color and style, but unfortunately it’s far too small for me to wear.  It’s too tight through the bust and belly regions, and there’s absolutely no stretch to the material.  I am 5’7” and normally wear a size 16/XL and this XL felt like a large, so you definitely need to order up a size or even two to wear this comfortably."
3.0,lied but didn't work for me not a product fault i just can't wear open under arm
3.0,Very bendy and looks cheap but thats what you get when you pay couple cents and dollars to ship.
3.0,Cute but the fishnet part doesn't stretch so there is a weird bunching of the straps. I cut it out and then wore fishnets underneath.
3.0,The material is very soft and nice. I have medical devices so I have to allow for that. True to size I. Top but pants are a but too snug sadly I have to return as it won't fit my braces in this style. I did measure and the garment is 1/2 size  too small in pants . Pink is larger than blue or feels it - returning both
3.0,No me funciono
3.0,"The scarf is very pretty but does ""shed"" on my clothes. I have bought about 5 different brand scarves this season (all price ranges) and all have been shedding. I am disappointed all around but this scarf doesn't shed too much so it is okay."
3.0,See comments above
3.0,"First off, I wear a mask right now (2020) any time I go out. I have multiple reusable masks, and some are more comfortable than others. Although this masks helps reduce the work to breathe, it’s loose in a comfortable position, and uncomfortable in a more secure position. I would recommend looking around for a more secure feeling mask."
3.0,"Such a cute dress but way too big for the size, usually mediums don’t fit like an extra large but this does. I still have it and I just pin and wear a belt or sash to try and make up for the over sizing."
3.0,As said. So small for adults
3.0,"I love the cut of this dress!  It fits well, is flattering, but as you would expect of a dress at this price, the fabric is really, really cheap/synthetic feeling."
3.0,It was okay. It was a bday present.
3.0,Mine looked nothing like this one. I specifically wanted these colors. Mine is burgandy and navy
3.0,"UPDATE Jan 23, 2017:  They fell apart today.  The nose piece completely disintegrated where it attaches to one of the lenses.  Even though I have all the &#34;pieces,&#34; there's no way to repair since the plastic in the lens where the nose piece attaches crumbled.  So I got 5 months of use -- not rough use; just normal use for working on the computer (put 'em on in the morning; take 'em off at night before I go to bed).  I was hoping for at least a year before I'd need to replace.  As I said, I know these are not the same quality as $200 readers, but even so, I would expect more than 5 months of use.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After having cataract surgery a few years ago, I've been struggling to find the &#34;right&#34; glasses for all of the various activities I enjoy:  working on the computer, reading, needlework, etc.  For those who haven't had the pleasure of cataract surgery, it usually leaves you with incredible distance vision (20/20 in most cases) but close-up vision is gone because the eyes can no longer change focus.  The ophthalmologist told me I'd probably need several different strengths, a different one for each activity, so I've been experimenting with various options to try to find the &#34;right&#34; combination.<br /><br />These Eyekepper Computer Reading Glasses are the PERFECT solution for my computer work as well as for in the car so I can see the dials/gauges on the dashboard.  This is the 4th different pair I've tried, and I think this will be the last.  They fit, they definitely cut down glare, and the strength (I got 1.75) is accurate.<br /><br />First, understand that these are NOT $200 reading glasses.  They will likely not hold up like $200 glasses.  They're very lightweight, and the ear pieces are very slender and feel ... well ... delicate, I guess is the word.  I don't think they will hold up to any sort of rough handling.  But if you're prepared to be careful with these, they should work fine.  And the company does offer a lifetime breakage warranty, so that provides some reassurance that the manufacturer stands behind the product.<br /><br />The color is a very pale peachy gold, and the lenses have a slight peach tint to help reduce.  At an angle, you can see the slight blue over-tint that contributes to eye comfort when you spend hours staring at a computer screen.  The rimless style works well, too, as I often have to look &#34;over&#34; the glasses to see distance, and these are the perfect size and fit for that.<br /><br />A final word about fit:  I have a rather broad/wide face and I've had problems in the past with readers that are too narrow, resulting in pinching and pressure points  Not so with these.  They're wide enough that they actually fit my wider face, and they're so lightweight that there's NO pressure on my ears or nose.  I really like that aspect.<br /><br />So overall, these work brilliantly.  I couldn't be happier.  I'll probably order another pair just to have a spare.  Solid enthusiastic 5 stars."
3.0,Glasses where exactly what I ordered however the first time I wore them the nose piece came off.
3.0,"I love the quality of the lanyard, but it's too long if you're average height.  I'm 5' 9"" and wanted to use this to wear/display my ID, but it's so long the ID ends up at my belt.  Wish there was an option to adjust length."
3.0,"this bad looks really good but the overall back padding seems a little hard, maybe this is good to protect a laptop but i was thinking to use this bag for not carrying laptop at times, this may be a little too hard and rigid looking. Of course as a laptop bag, it probably meets the requirement."
3.0,Nicer than bracelet but kinda large not real pop bead size
3.0,This bracelet is absolutely adorable but the black detailing almost immediately came off and looked as if it had been painted in the etching.
3.0,The mask are thick. Hard to breathe. Nose wire is not very useful...does not stay in place
3.0,"cute, but the tassels are a little wonky... almost as if they were put on hooks backwards."
3.0,"Fabric had foul scent which seemed to wash off in laundry.  Nice body fit.  Sleeves too tight at biceps, making arm movement painful.  Hood only covers back of your head. Rain inters in between button spaces—useful for trizzel with umbrella.  Flatters female figure."
3.0,Fabric is nice sleeves are very long
3.0,very cute but ran way too big
3.0,Beautiful and nice material but not for a curvy woman as it's not stretchy material
3.0,Another knock off dress. It is not the same as pictured above. There is white material at the bottom and at the neckline. did not come with collar but it did come with a headband... The other dress I ordered from this seller was a knock off too.
3.0,"These pants are not true to size. Also, the spandex is weak and foes not hold to one’s body well. Lovely style but not a good fit for curvy women."
3.0,Cut really big
3.0,Although it is pretty -it arrived with the big stone broken off - unable to wear it.
3.0,Not the greatest quality of sound
3.0,Sized as 2x<br />fits my daughter tight and she is size 14
3.0,Extra cute purse i love the chain. My onmy complaint is how small it is in reality. I ordered for a 7 year old girl and its still so small she can only get a few Chapstick tubes in it
3.0,"I had to make a repair before even wearing them, but they fit well."
3.0,Good but the stones at the end are big... Too big for my liking
3.0,I bought the ML and it was too big.  My watch was constantly spinning around my arm.  I ordered the SM and it was way too tight.  It made my watch dig into my skin and leave imprints.
3.0,Prett cute.. they are very “cheap” though so break easily. One of the cards was in Spanish which would have been nice to know. Cute gift for a teen maybe?
3.0,"I thought these looked very cute in the review pictures, so I ordered them. The material doesn't feel like a good material, and that turned me off. The waist is one big piece of elastic (1"") that is not sewed down. This has the potential to turn and curl within the seam area. Not made in a high quality manner."
3.0,Photos makes it look better. The outside pockets makes the styling horribly ridiculous.
3.0,"I bought these shoes for around-the-house wear.<br />Bad idea.  They were size 8.5 and I take an 8.5, but they were too big and did not stay snug on my feet, neither the top part (toes) or the heel.<br />So I returned them to Whole Foods for a very quick and easy drop off and return.<br />My refund was made within 24 hours, so kudos for Amazon for their support."
3.0,great for days coming up to period and after-  you do still need sanitary napkins or tampons
3.0,Only good for tiny women with big breasts
3.0,"Overall I wish I could give it a 5 star. Quality of workmanship is actually, not too shabby.<br />The part this is troubling is the magnet. It’s really strong, it’s so strong that I am now worried that it will demagnetize my credit cards. It did come with a warning that that may occur.<br />So I’ve gone now, back to my old wallet.  It’s a shame cause I spent $ on something I can’t use."
3.0,Seems to be great quality but it was way too big. I’m 5”5’ 130lbs and got a size small and it was huge! It didn’t fit right anywhere. Going to exchange for an XS and hope that’s a good fit.
3.0,"Fits well, made well, looks cool, but hard to breathe through, otherwise exactly what I wanted."
3.0,Material acode con el precio
3.0,order two sizes bigger than you think
3.0,"It fit comfortably with a compression shirt underneath, as for stretch and sweat absorption it could be better"
3.0,I don't care for the narrow part of the belt. From the description I didn't notice that it was scalped like it is.
3.0,The material is a bit thin and see through. I would have preferred a slightly more thick fabric.
3.0,Fit is ok. It has extra ruffles in the tummy area which creates a bump. Not flattering. It may work well for someone who is fairly tall
3.0,The back post are a bit long and stick into my neck.  Only wore once
3.0,It's either sticking out way too far or sliding all the way through the pierced hole and floating around my nostril. Too small for me.
3.0,"They're alright, I like them but they are kinda thin and tight it just kinda makes it awkward cause it's big in legs but it's tight in awkward areas. I do like the product I think more will like it more than me though. I wear them to bed, not public kinda see through stepmom didn't care for them much."
3.0,I really wanted to love these. They come highly recommended from doctors. They have a nice insert in the shoe that shows when you need a new size. They have a nice flexible sole which is what we were looking for after trying out the Striderite. We have only worn ours a few times and they are already starting to fall apart at the seam between the sole and the upper shoe.
3.0,No support in the top. Couldn't wear. Bottoms fit good though.
3.0,I like the look of this dress but the material was a little cheaper than expected it doesnt give and is kinda shiny looking. Large pattern but overall ok.
3.0,"These are giant sized for knuckle rings. I wear a size eight around the base of my fingers, but couldn’t wear any of these."
3.0,"Not happy with sizing, but will use."
3.0,"I've never had so much trouble putting on a bracelet.<br /><br />Though a 7.5-inch bracelet should fit my wrist -- I struggled to get the clasp on this bugger to latch for a full fifteen minutes and finally gave up in frustration.<br /><br />The problem is not just the rather diminutive clasp but the bracelet's construction. It easily gets twisted around, reducing its length even more, making it harder to put on.<br /><br />So unless you're Houdini reincarnated -- or can rely on a significant other to assist you in putting this piece on and taking it off -- or until such time as the manufacturer offers sizes at least 1/2 inch larger than your wrist -- I would suggest giving this item a pass.<br /><br />It's too bad, because the bracelet looks good and has a nice weight to it.<br /><br />Well, my loss here will be the Salvation Army's gain..."
3.0,"Must be washed separatly, it sheds like crazy. However. So soft and my daughter loves it"
3.0,red color is more of a cherry red than ruby red.
3.0,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my son. He has big feet but they fit wonderfully. Well made. Would buy again!
3.0,too small - should have known it was china sizes.
3.0,The stitching or material isn't very good. It will not hold up for as long as even a $5 brick and mortar store purchase without ripping at a seam.<br /><br />They need to rethink the design for the price sad to say.
3.0,It just fit me weird. I returned it.
3.0,Snaps where a lad too large
3.0,"I ordered this shirt to wear with camo pants.  The color matches perfectly, but it is VERY SMALL.  I'm glad I read the other reviews.  I usually wear a med and I ordered an XL which fits.  The material is thin and it doesn't flow like swing tops do, but I do like the convertible sleeves, going from long to 3/4 with the tab.  If it flowed over the body more fluidly, I would order another because the price is so good.  But I won't be....like it but not quite what I was looking for in style.  But I will keep it because the color matches my camo so well!!"
3.0,Arrived with a hole in it.
3.0,"If your eyesight is good you can easily read the time. I would recommend this watch more for a young woman as it is thin,lightweight and sporty. Older men would prefer larger numbers and a masculine size"
3.0,"This dress is very cute; however, I had to return it because of the fit.  I'm a size 6/8, but very busty.  Unfortunately, this particular dress was more high-waisted (almost empire waist) than what I expected based on the photos.  It didn't hit my waistline."
3.0,I thought it would have been built a little better.  The mesh on this was rather soft.  After one wash it started to come fray.
3.0,El color es muy palido
3.0,I like the look of it but there are no pockets inside. It's too big for your pocket so you still have to place it in your purse. I like it but I don't like that it's only useful for cards or bulkier items really. The latch top doesn't protect anything from falling out should it tip over.
3.0,This jacket definitely ran small and therefore did not fit.  Really not that disappointed;  It is really not my style.  The zippers/and zipper pulls are large and appear cheap.  They make a fair amount of noise as you move. Makes the jacket seem cheap IMO.
3.0,I bought this to wear for a Christmas concert. I sized up on this and it was still super tight on the arm and a little tight across the chest. I ended up taking the sleeves off completely and wearing it with a cardigan over top.
3.0,There was too much gapping in the top for me to keep it. But I liked the idea of the suit. If you're busty it'd probably fit nicely.
3.0,The were cute but very long so I returned for replacement
3.0,"My disappointment was in the quality of knit.  I wanted to it be a tighter knit sweater.  I loved it otherwise, but returned it.  Not for me."
3.0,I like the fit. But across the top it seem to be frayed on both sides already.  Maybe the design because it does not seem like a quality issue since the fray is equal. Overall I love the slippers and would buy again. I do not know if I need to go to one size larger. This fits so well. It is only the separation that bothers me.
3.0,I went by the size chart and bought a small however it’s too big on my waist and keeps falling down. I’m only wearing them on walks since I can’t stand having to adjust my clothes while running or doing HIIT workouts. I like the material though so 3 stars.
3.0,Broke after the third time wearing. Was cute while they lasted.
3.0,The teal is more blueish turquoise. Definitely not teal!
3.0,"I'd give it 2.5 stars I'd I could.<br />The only good thing about this costume was the material quality. Which was very good! My two biggest complaints are the fit and the molded breast cups..... horrible! The dress is much bigger than the stated sizes. I ordered one size up because of other comments. Not the case for me. I should've stayed with my normal size or maybe even gone down one. Also it is very long.  I am only 5'3"", but there were about 5 inches laying on the floor after trying it on. And as you can see from the pictures, the molded cups are ridiculous! The blue lines on the pictures follow the cup lines since it is kind of hard to see. Not only are they almost in my neck, but they are different heights.<br />It was also missing the belt for the quiver. (Unless I missed the memo stating it didn't come with it) That's not a huge problem to fix but for the price I paid I'd like to have the whole costume and actually be able to wear it.<br />The package arrived late. Supposed to arrive the 25th and wasn't here until the 29th. I have prime and this was supposed to be the two day but it got delayed. Amazon did apologize and made it right though.<br />I am doing the return tonight for obvious reasons. Guess I'll dig another costume out of the closet for Halloween tomorrow. I know, I know, I'm last minute :o)"
3.0,"Cheap thin fabric, spend a little more and get a better quality. If you by it you’ll need a slip dress under it."
3.0,"Hi the green color are so brilliant ,but the blouse are to big for me."
3.0,Zipper is really tight---and doesn't open wide enough---cute purse otherwise.
3.0,It's an okay bandana the only problem is it has only one side print
3.0,"I am 7 1/2 month pregnant, 5'2, and 154lbs. I ordered a small and I like the way the top of the dress looks and feels. My belly pushes the mid part of the dress out and it looks bigger than I would like. The material is nice and light. I'm happy I didn't go any bigger than a small. I may have been happier with a xs but the top of the dress might have been a little too snug."
3.0,This shirt fit but it was a very strange material and I ultimately ended up returning.
3.0,The sizing was right.  Just shorter In the crotch to waist area.  Will be returning.  Hole in the bootie area.
3.0,Definitely runs small. Get a size larger. Belt itself seems fine.
3.0,Cool looking watch
3.0,Disappointed with this dress. the waist is way to high for the size and makes it look bad on me. I have had to purchase a wide belt for it and a sleeveless jacket to go over it as it makes me look even more heavy than I am  and I am heavy.
3.0,In less than a year of use the velcro no long stays together
3.0,"This has more of a Halloween costume feel to it. The beard and wig shed a little bit, and the mustache part does not have enough hair on it because you can see the band of where the “mustache” hair would be. The jacket is a pullover, the pants are high waters, and if you have big calves the biggest size would fit best due to the boots covers."
3.0,"This was okay. Our son, who got this to go with his Halloween costume loved it. But the pin did break off on the first day and it is on the small side. Though it lights up and plays the song from fortnite, which was a big hit in our house."
3.0,You don't have any fabric allergies. I break out in my bikini line every time I wear these :'(<br />Truly such a shame because they are perfectly buttery soft and go really well under my sheer leggings. I hate that these didn't work for me. Back to the drawing board...
3.0,"Good for the price. I'm keeping it and will use it. That being said, it's smaller than I imagined. It's more of a scarf... I thought it would be a mire float poncho loOk. It also arrived vacuum packed and extremely creased, but hopefully a quick iron should fix that. Lastly, the fur is very flat and not very real looking, and I noticed it sheds a bit. Still in all, it looks good on and is the perfect piece for spring or fall"
3.0,I like it.  You have to sit it close to your forehead to get the effect of a covered face but...it does the job.
3.0,My baby has fat feet. So a little hard to pull on. Also the soles slip out when talking them off. Otherwise good!
3.0,interesting but too wide
3.0,"These seem quite thin and are rather small. But well, the price is reasonable so that counts for something. My husband has a Sz 11.5 shoe - so you might want to reconsider if you're an 11 or larger."
3.0,Fits kinda small but its cute
3.0,Wanted the red and white colors instead. Bead is too small for the price. Came well packaged.
3.0,Not bad . My friend didnt like it alot
3.0,Put them in my shoe first off and thought they were going to work fine....but today...I wore them playing golf and I started hurting so bad I had to take my shoes off to play starting on the 14th hole.  Just could not tolerate the pain any more; so guess I wrote my 5 star review too early.  Never had to play golf without shoes before.  My four-sum had some fun with the jokes regarding.  I hope it gets better but I doubt I'll be able to wear these insoles any more for more than 30-60 mins.  Sure wish they would have worked because I thought they were a good price.  Hope NAZAROO will allow me to return them....<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Update:  Nazaroo contacted me regarding my review &amp; offered an allowance to edit or delete it.  My response was: we are unwilling to lie but will note the fact that Nazaroo has ultimately resolved the concern.  We do feel that the result was fair so we have changed from 2 stars to 3 stars.  Thank you.
3.0,They aren't round. The lenses are very large. They are too tight around my ears
3.0,"It’s a great size. I was expecting a nice shiny finish. It looks awfully old and scratched up on the top silver part. Maybe it’s just distressing, but it doesn’t match what shown in the ad."
3.0,Slides. Extremely  long. Image when worn is unrecognizable. A disappointment.
3.0,"Less opaque than I expected and sort of a blueish gray, was hoping for more of a true gray. That said, they fit well and seem to stay put pretty well."
3.0,"They are a great replacement for the ones we had that were worn out BUT they are not read. They are more of an orange. The strap is actually red and there is a big different in the color of the frames and the strap. If the lens had not been falling out of my son’s previous pair of frames, I would have sent these back. My son was really looking forward to the red frames so he could match his Spider-Man."
3.0,Faded rather quickly
3.0,"More white and blue marble in coloring than expected.  Still cute, plan to keep."
3.0,Elastic hair ties pinch my wrist so this is a good way to keep one on me and look cute. The &#34;hooks&#34; however have scratched my skin several times.
3.0,Design super cute and very thick fabric. Shipping just takes very long.
3.0,"It’s an alright product. Definitely oversized, but I found the material to be itchy."
3.0,Nice fabric but they run short for size . I’m 5’5 and ordered a medium . I usually wear a size 6 or 8 and these stop at an odd spot on my ankle
3.0,"I bought Set 1 and only two fit me ( ear wrap in the 3rd photo & the skull). The tiger earring doesn't have any really support and I would have to get another piercing in order for it to fit comfortably. The one that looks like a wave looks good where I want it to be placed, but the cuff portion is flimsy and causes it to fall off easily. The other ear wrap is just short, or my head is too big! It ships from Hawaii, so I got it pretty fast."
3.0,"The watch is pretty, but very large. Multiple links needed to be taken off. The time keeping is also a bit off so I wouldn't plan on this being your go-to time keeper; more just for a cute accessory. The rose color is nice, but scratches easily. The metal is also a little itchy when the watch is worn all day."
3.0,Very tight in chest! Cute and flowy but not large chest friendly!
3.0,"The fang is a bit bigger than i thought it would be. Other than that i like it, i just wish it was smaller. Its about the size of a half dollar coin."
3.0,"The design is cute, could wear as a top, size runs small and material is very thin."
3.0,Super cute just didn't fit as I expected it to
3.0,"Very cute bear, but the inside hole was inconsistent (smaller on one side), so it didn’t fit on the bracelet and I actually broke the bracelet trying to get this one on."
3.0,Love them...but runs really small
3.0,Ok for price. Finally fell apart
3.0,"Very cute. Only problem is that it slides up, and you constantly have to pull it back down. Fashion tape will fix that though."
3.0,Love the fit it’s perfect except I’m 5’9 and they are a little short
3.0,"A strange critique but the material is too thick. You want to be able to fold and twist a scarf this long and with the material being thicker it does not make it comfortable to wear, too much material around your neck.  The color was exactly as pictured, very pretty."
3.0,Had lots of stretch but it was suppose to be a large but fit like a sme-dium!
3.0,Ordered this for my daughter and it is not as loose as it looks. She is typically in a size 10 so I ordered the XL for a bigger feel. Unfortunately this did not work out for what we wanted.
3.0,"Uni-boob. Only for people size b and under. Tighter than it looks in the picture. Nice material, though. Straps are an afterthought."
3.0,"Cute Black & White suit:<br />I had high hopes for this suit.  I loved the marble black and white pattern.  I was really only buying for the top as I am not a fan of rouching bottoms.<br />First the top does not tie together it just a long piece that hangs for you to knot but once done looks cute. Top is not actually adjustable.  However it was not needed as was very tight on me.  I am a 36C and typically do not fill the bust however I was spilling out of this top and not in an attractive way.<br />The bottoms werent awful sizing wise but the inside label is attached to the front (I normally cut out labels in swimwear but this would have left the stitching visible in the front just below my belly button.<br />So unfortunately I am returning.<br /><br />I am adding to this review as can't leave a seperate review for 2nd suit:<br /><br />Odd Blue & White suit:  prior to my ordering the black and white suit for me I ordered the blue tank style for my daughter.  Both of these are Larges but can see from pictures the differences in sizing.  She is 5'4"" and weighs 125lb with a 39C.  The top was too small for us both and the pads just float around inside. As you can also see from the picture it is not a long top so do not expect a tankini length.  It falls just below your bra strap line.  The bottoms were huge.  The pattern is darling and the price was amazing I was gonna keep for me if fit but apparently is a No Deal on both due to tiny sizing."
3.0,"This suit is kinda flattering, but the belt portion actually hits in a way that made my lower belly below it pooch, and the back is cut straight across, which cuts into the back a bit. The material is on the cheaper side has almost no give, unlike more expensive suits. I had to very carefully hoist it past my hips so I didn't bust a seam.<br />But the real issue for me was the lack of bust support. If you don't mind the girls laying low, and you're just lounging by the pool, this suit might work fine. But I prefer a little lift and support, and this suit offers none. Plus, the top is loose enough that you could easily have a nip slip in the water. I need something a bit more sporting, so pass."
3.0,"I got the dark gray, charcoal. The inside is like a rough towel (as mentioned in another review) it seems like the material is different depending on what color sweatshirt you get. Definitely not soft inside...disappointing.  I bought it because most of the reviews said it was super soft. The one I got is NOT soft. Bummed.  Don't buy the charcoal color is you want super soft on the inside."
3.0,not bad for one time use
3.0,for me temple pieces a bit short.the underneath lens a bit thick and seems to rob me of near vision while riding my motorcycle.
3.0,The pouch is quite small
3.0,Like but tooooo small.. can barely see the symbol
3.0,Shirt fits pretty tight. Definitely a stretchy conforming material and not a regular t shirt material. Also the flower on the front is like a slab of plastic glued to the shirt. It is cute though if you don't mind this material and order like 2 sizes up.
3.0,"This item is a lot smaller than I thought it would of been. But, thankfully the person I bought it for has a very small wrist."
3.0,The description said “add one or two cups naturally”. This didn’t really add any size for me (38DD) but I can see how it might be perfect for someone else.
3.0,Nice garment.  Exceeded number of garments I wished to purchase.
3.0,"This is the second watch I've purchased on Amazon and I definitely believe you get hat you pay for. That being said I received the watch today and was really excited. The first thing I did was push the pin in case it fell out, because that's what happen to the first watch. Then, I started winding the watch and nothing happened. I tapped it a few time to try and see if it would, but it didn't. I just need to go to watch store in person and spend the extra money on a nice watch. The only reason I'm giving this watch 3 stars instead of 1 is because the design is very nice."
3.0,"Love the top, but the side seams are not even so when your hands are in the pockets the top is crooked."
3.0,The dress is okay. I returned it because it’s size was small for my daughter
3.0,It's cute but the color is yellow kind of weird I think I will exchange it for a different  color.
3.0,A bit difficult to get on & stay on. I love the look. I'm still working on the fit.
3.0,"I love the way it looks, but it fell off after wearing it once.  But, I have that problem with a lot of belly rings, so it could just be me."
3.0,"I mistakenly thought this was waterproof.  It's not.  There's not really a great place ofr cash in this wallet.  You have to fold it into quarters, which is a pain unfolding to pay and takes up sapce unless you're rolling with a couple hundred dollar bills (pray you don't get change bc there's no room!).  Credit cards just sit loosely in pockets, so while you're cards won't get scanned, they may fall out as you open wallet."
3.0,almost too small to read
3.0,"The product is really good, but the price is quite expensive. It's very good and sturdy. Came on time and perfectly."
3.0,"I stuck with my usual size and they’re too small and tight in the waist and hips, I could get them on but just barely.  I need at least one more size up, maybe two if I want them to be “LOOSE”. ** No size chart was made available which is a bummer and it looks like it is still not available.  Personally I would just skip these and go onto another option. If you choose them, definitely go one size up.  The material is just ok, it’s lightweight and crisp so it is easily wrinkled and not the softest.  Length is standard and the cut is not very attractive.  I’m really disappointed and can’t recommend them."
3.0,It smells but its cute
3.0,Very cute but will be cutting sleeves off or tucking them in. Sleeves are extremely tight and not a stretchy material. Would be better if they had the stretchy material like the back of the top.
3.0,Size and fit was good. Was not as full as I was hoping for.
3.0,"Quality isn’t great. They’re cute and comfortable enough, though."
3.0,"Some pieces are flimsy. One broke while I was trying on. Other pieces sturdier.<br />Overall, does the job"
3.0,"They look great but the material theyre made out of is beyond cheap, they don't feel very comfortable on your feet, retain sweat badly, and have trouble staying up on your leg. I only wear them occasionally when I go out to dress-casual bars so its fine by me, but I wouldn't wear them to work or anything like that."
3.0,I’d love to give these a 5 star because the ones that did fit were very comfy and perfect . However I bought 5 pairs and out of 5 pairs only 2 were true to size . The other 3 were considerably smaller than they were supposed to be . 1 pair that did fit were completely the wrong color than what I ordered . Disappointed .
3.0,This is super thin<br /> Not something you could wear with a short top. Not recommended for work outs. Slides down. I got a large as I needed it comfortable but because they are super thin lycra ish they are big for me. For reference i fit in a size 8 or 10 USA. They are long for my height. I'm 5.5. So they scrunch up which is not the look I'm going for. A return it is. Im given it 2 stars to be kind. Cos Had I got an M size I would have worn them around the house.
3.0,Dress was beautiful but didn’t fit I actually got a size up and still did fit<br />So this dress is not true to size
3.0,These piercings are quite tiny. There hinges are weak and super hard to close.
3.0,Blister formed after 1 day of running.
3.0,"I've worn this belt for about 3 mos. On first impression everything was great. A few weeks ago the belt pulled out of the buckle. I trimmed belt and went on then it pulled out again, then again, then again. I've concluded if you ""need"" a belt to hold your pants up this may not be it. Apparently the teeth that hold the belt in the buckle are not designed for much tension as a couple of teeth appear to be broken and they are also shorter than those of a previous buckle, different brand, that I am now using on the belt. The old buckle seems to be holding better."
3.0,I liked these but wish there was an identier for the bracelets.
3.0,"From picture on model, it appears this is a top long enough to cover your bumb. Once I got it, it really is that odd length in between tee shirt/ tunic. Also very wide for the size. Returned as even though I purchased with a discount, still did not think I got my money's worth"
3.0,Very cute but runs entirely too small.
3.0,"In the picture they appear to have a silver frame. That was the main reason I liked because it goes well with my skin tone. However when they arrived, the frame turned out to be gold. The gold frame still looks good but not on me so I have them to my girlfriend who has a tan complexion. She loves them. Also, one of the sides is crooked. You can't tell while they're being worn but when taken off the bend is clear. My gf says they are still comfortable so that's good, but seeing as it wasn't what I ordered specifically as far as frame color and how one of the sides is bent, I can't give this product five stars."
3.0,They look great but the stitching leaves dents in my legs. I will just by plain compression socks from now on.
3.0,too big for kids shoes.  They break easier than I expected but my boys are really hard on shoes.
3.0,So cute! But so tiny!
3.0,"This boot color is great, the design is good but with not zipper it makes the shoe hard to put on and take off and the calf is too tight."
3.0,Much larger than expected. But still cute. Waiting for my toddler to grow into them
3.0,"Didn't realize this was kid sized, maybe I just didn't read the fine print, but it worked just fine."
3.0,These are for kids (age 3 and younger)- they are NOT full-size.  Wish the ad had been more clear about this.
3.0,The dress is ok but not true to size.
3.0,No. Torso short
3.0,"I have them on and am noticing there is quite a bit of material in the front as if it was made for a mans package.  I would not purchase these again based on that, it looks odd.  The elastic waistband is too tight, not comfortable, definately do not need the drawstring.  I bought a large and I usually wear a medium."
3.0,Doesn’t fit very well.
3.0,The fabric is light and full of static electricity do it clings
3.0,"Really cute! Was really hoping that the pointed pieces were white as that's what the product description said. However, they are clear like crystals. Kind of makes it somewhat tacky to me but overall the piece is really cool. Some of the pieces are pliable so be very careful with it. I'm hoping the links don't break apart and that the jewels don't fall out as I can see the glue on some of them...but that's kind of what I expected for the price. Overall I think you're going to get what you pay for here. Cool statement piece if you don't look at it too closely."
3.0,"The dress is okay, not what I expected.  The fabric is thin and look cheap.  I guess you will have to buy a kan-kan slip to get the fullness.  I decided to give the dress away, instead of returning it.  I would not recommend anyone to buy this dress."
3.0,Beautiful! I ordered them for a friend and like them so much I ordered a pair for myself and another friend who also liked them!
3.0,Size up. Runs a bit small.<br />Not lined. Cotton.<br />Is a cute dress .First time I have ordered from this company.<br />Will return for a size up.
3.0,Runs small! Material is soft
3.0,I ordered an XL and it was big.  Returned for a large and it fit perfect.
3.0,Not as nice as the photos
3.0,Not form fitting at all
3.0,Corset looks just like the photo but runs very very small. One down side it the cheap plastic type string the put for the lace up.
3.0,"comes really wrinkled, so bad, it was hard to even tell what they looked like on. But the fit on me was not great, and it was not flattering at all. I retuned them"
3.0,"These were a major PITA to install. My kid wears a size 1Y shoe, and can't quite tie laces, yet. These help the shoes stay on her feet - if she can wiggle her feet in there. We had to break the laces in a bit by stretching the shoes open and closed. Next time I'll buy the elastic laces with the toggle, so we can get the shoe fully open."
3.0,"Looks great, however, I look like a freak putting it on and feel like I will be split in half. Torso too short. But still looks great. Awe the price we pay... Spend $ not comfort."
3.0,I'm about 5'7 140. This is more of a cotton blended material.  I always get a size large one ordering from Amazon with unknown origin .  It is small in the waste  (nothing is ever small in the waist for me)  rib cage fit is OK it is long so I will have to get it altered after washing it to see how much it shrinks .  When I bought this is said it was rayon .  I work for a clothing company and a little disappointed to see this with more of a cotton material and I know it will shrink greatly .  Other than that beautiful coloring .
3.0,"Great for all your Unicorn needs. Though in the beginning it did have a very overwhelming latex smell, but that went away after a while. Hard to see from the sides, almost like you are wearing horse blinders, or maybe unicorn blinders either way you can only see straight forward. 3/5."
3.0,"took the summer for a run disappointed, they are on fleece."
3.0,"I am 6'5&quot; 188 lb, athletic build.  I bought a medium for part of a halloween costume. The fabric is pretty snazzy and the shirt fits snug enough to show musculature, which is what I wanted for the costume.  I expect the next size up would be loose around the abs, which wouldn't be the effect I want for the costume.  You can see in the model photo on the website, the model is pretty athletic looking, and they are wearing size that is somewhat looser around the abs.  They are probably a lot more comfortable.  I find the shoulders tight, especially where my arms emerge from the torso of the shirt… I hope it stretches out with wear.  for a costume, not so big a deal.  the other thing that I find more annoying is that the shirt is just very short.  if I raise my arms it rises up and my abdomen is uncovered.  If I hold very still, it looks good for the costume, but my arms may go numb shortly.<br /><br />Update:  I put on some more muscle and it became impossible to wear. My teenage daughter snagged it."
3.0,"Pretty tight through chest and arms (I am a large to extra large, 40 inch chest) . Very pretty and well made though. Guess I will give this to a niece."
3.0,This women's linen romper looked really cute on the model but it looks terrible on. I got a size bigger than I normally would as romper tend to have a weird fit. Even with the larger size its really tight in the hips are everything else is big and baggy. The portions of the romper are off. I got the black one but there are 4 colors in total that you can pick from. It has 2 buttons in the front for closure. After washing it only once it did get smaller as well. I will not be wearing this romper again. It's made out of 70% Cotton and 30% Linen and is machine washable. Price was good.
3.0,The shoe looks great. but the size was too small.
3.0,Well I didn't even get to wear it.  I ended up dropping it in the sink and the drain wasn't closed. I was excited to try it and forgot to close the drain as I normally do. Bummed.  It seemed to be good quality but I will never know 😮
3.0,They work pretty well for the price they're better than nothing and they really do help
3.0,"I wanted to love this watch, I really did. The watch loses a couple minutes throughout the day, and the band feels more like a cheap plastic. For the price you pay for an Invicta watch, you can easily purchase something much more reliable like a Casio, Timex, or even Seiko"
3.0,shrinks more than we expected
3.0,"This is a cute shirt.  Nice color.  I got the rosy  color.  I love cold shoulder  shirts.  I have a tattoo on my upper arm  that I like to show.  But  am getting at the age  where  sleeveless shirts  are not always so good  ( got that loose  under arm thing  going on,,,  :(  )  .  The  stitching  looks  pretty good on this  shirt .  Until you get to the shoulders.  There is a seam  at the top of one of the shoulders.  (  either it should  be in the back . or  maybe  both shoulders  should have one)  I have  put on pictures. It is hard to see.  but  the  one  shoulder strap is a bit narrower than the other.  It is not and expensively  made shirt ,  nor is it priced as such.  It  does  flow well.  I like the way it looks<br />I received this  shirt  at a discount for my honest review"
3.0,The design is very pretty however the bottom is too voluminous and long.  More of like a Sunday church dress for mature women. The dress is just big. I am 5'2 150 lbs. I ordered a small and could have probably ordered an x-small. I am not a large chested woman so the top was really loose. I normally wear a small/medium and am a size 4 in standard (American) dress size.
3.0,Had to sew to make the large a bit bigger but it did fit after fixing. Not meant for bigger chests
3.0,It was about a size too small
3.0,"It’s super cute, but hurts when you wear it for long periods of time"
3.0,Cute but only if you have no boobs. It’s really low cut and has little support.
3.0,Runs about 2-3 sizes smaller than normal sizes.
3.0,flowers are ironed on
3.0,Very nice jacket ordered a 2x but was not true to size returned
3.0,"Makes your butt look nice yes. But I've worn them twice and there's a whole in them already. Maybe it was there when I got them who knows, but I noticed it today, the second time wearing them. But my other pair is fine."
3.0,It looks polarized to me even when they say they're not
3.0,The middle strip of ribbon is kinda see through
3.0,"Had to wear these after a knee surgery because I work in a lab setting and needed pants. Within a week, half of the snaps had broken off. The problem is that the snaps pull through the holes in the fabric where they attach. I guess maybe they aren't riveted strongly enough? There were still enough working snaps I could wear them with shorts underneath, but at that point they were more like 'leg coverings"" than actual pants."
3.0,It takes a long time to come
3.0,Way too small. Rear pooches out of back flap. Poor design
3.0,"I ordered this outfit for my daughters fourth birthday. I was pleased with the color, and design of the top and bottom.  The top fit her pretty well. Her mermaid party was in November so I put a long-sleeved shirt up under the top and it looked fine. However, the pants were too short. After reading a number of reviews before I ordered, I was aware that the outfit ran small. So, I Intentionally ordered a size 6. She normally wears a size 4. I ordered up TWO sizes and the pants still didn’t fit the way I wanted them to but my baby was happy and she still looked cute :)"
3.0,"Shoes are super cute on, but not feasible to wear as everyday shoes. Clasp is super fragile and not secure."
3.0,"This dress was pretty and looks kind of like Kate Spade's floral line from a few years ago.  The dress was a thick scuba-like material which I didn't mind.  The straps were too long for me and I needed alterations in the cups because it was way too big.  I am 5'6"" 135 lbs and small-chested.  The dress is very low cut which was not too much of an issue for me because I am small-chested, but it did require alterations.  I ended up keeping for a wedding but after I paid $50 for alterations I wish I would have gone with a different dress."
3.0,"Material is weird, no ‘give’ at all... have to return unfortunately bc I really wanted pants with pin tuck... I’ll keep looking!"
3.0,Cute hats but the bottle doesn’t stand up & the foam is so thin it ripped adjusting hat. The bottle fits tight & the mug fits loose
3.0,Sizes run very small and the exact same flip flop is available for $6 less. I suggest you always buy a size bigger than you need. ALso they make you pay full shipping for returns.
3.0,Everything was as exoected from a 2$  ring. I had to rip the gem from the eye and reapply it because it wasn't placed right. I also had to tighten it. over all everything was good. I would buy it again at the same price but nothing more.
3.0,"Was looking for a belt to fit with my buckle, this one looked patchy and not smooth. Returned it"
3.0,The quilt is ok not good not bad.
3.0,the print is some what out of focus ?? and slightly wonky but over all a really good product. shorter than it looks in the photos so be careful.
3.0,"The quality is pretty good but the smallest size the waist is too large, had to return."
3.0,"The receipient loved it and it is still working after Christmas so I guess I'm satisfied with it. Not a fine piece of jewelry, but an OK gift."
3.0,I typically wear a medium in women's but these pants have the longest crotch! I have to roll them twice to make them fit right and the legs are very long. If I'd known they were designed for a tall man I wouldn't have ordered them. Perhaps this was my fault as I don't recall whether it said mens or womens sizes but they are cute and comfy!
3.0,"This is pretty cute and the price is excellent.  My only problem is the length - yes it states that it is a choker but I actually can't even fasten it around my neck.  More petite, small-necked ladies should be OK."
3.0,"It's ok - nothing outstanding, but different."
3.0,"Nicely priced stainless steel watch, however it ticks loudly."
3.0,Came apart the first time I wore it. It still cute
3.0,"I purchased this for my daughter to surprise her with on the Ahsoka episode of Mando. I added an inch to the measurements I submitted, and the headpiece is too small. It barely fits her. I messaged the seller, but they have not responded in weeks. The quality is good, but not worth it if it doesn't fit. I wouldn't recommend taking the chance, especially since the seller is non-responsive.<br /><br />Edit: The business DID reach out to me, I missed their email. They do take returns, I've updated the stars from 1 to 3."
3.0,Good seller-Fast shipping -good price -but zipper only lasted for one trip on plane before breaking.
3.0,"Love the looks of this - just one of the &#34;O&#34; rings keeps coming open and - well that's not great - plus I should have measured more closely, I can't close this completely with my laptop inside it.  Again - it looks beautiful though!"
3.0,I got a 2XL and it fits me like a large would. I don't mind it being a crop but I really have to wear something under it otherwise my boobs will show.
3.0,It looks a lot sleeker in the stock images than in real life. Overall disappointed by the cheap feel of the sunglasses but it's not a bang for your buck considering how cheap it is.
3.0,They're cute and very whimsical. They're great to introduce your little girls to a bit of girly nestalgia. Too fun.
3.0,So my 3 year old son is thin and tall so I ordered 3T lord knows he in nothing 4T barely in 3… it run small! He will get one wear! Shorts look like a 6-9 month old could fit them! No stretch at all!
3.0,It really is meant for tiny waisted people. But I wear it high up on dresses with empire waists so it does work because of how stretchy it is.
3.0,"Super cute but the fabric clung in all the wrong places. Not flattering on me. I would say if you're curvy, order a size or two up."
3.0,Not as many grippies as I would like
3.0,thinmaterial cheap made
3.0,It seems smaller than the picture but I didn't use a ruler to see how big it would be before I ordered it.  Seems strong though.
3.0,the top and bottom didn't match at all as advertised but i managed to pair the top with another pants. plus the top material was totally different from the bottom
3.0,Wish it was two inches wider.  Barely fits all the books.
3.0,I love the style of the sweater but I ordered a cream sweater and received a white sweater.  My plan was if the cream sweater looked how it was supposed to and fit like it was supposed to I was going to order a white one but now I have to find somewhere else to order a cream sweater from.
3.0,the waders run big
3.0,How do you figure out picking the correct  size since they aren't shoes but fit more like sock. Do go smaller on the size?
3.0,Three stars because I don't like the bottom part. It looks funny. I'm going to see if my sister can alter it somehow. Maybe taper down those wing looking sides a little bit. They tend to stick out more than fall and lay nicely. Very form fitting yet material is a bit stretchy so it's not constricting. Still an odd looking garment to try and wear with anything. I tried it on when I got and it still sits in a bag. Tried it on one more time thinking it was just me and the type of day I was having(when we don't like anything we put on)lol. And still had the same affect. For the price it is a nice top. But just not for me I guess.
3.0,"These are very good for the price, however they begin to unravel at the wrist after a half dozen wearings."
3.0,It’s seems like the second hand or the minute hand is slower than usual. I have to adjust the time every 3 hrs or it falls behind a few minutes.
3.0,"Thin sport like / athletic material, sizing is true to size maybe bc it was meant to be worn oversized but planning to wear it like an everyday shirt over jeans. Good silkscreen quality,f ront button closure with a nice white trim."
3.0,Not as expected .  On the less sturdy side
3.0,"The overall fit of this is great and it looks amazing. BUT it’s very short, I won’t be able to wear any shoe with a heel and I’m not tall!"
3.0,Fits perfectly but cheap thin material
3.0,"These looked grate out of the box but upon closer inspection they felt a little weak and too flexible. After wearing them for a few days the flex was too much for the GLUE holding the lenses in the frames and one came out. I can put it back in but it comes out when ever I take off my glasses I'm going to have to glue it back in or throw these out, probably the latter."
3.0,"These arrived with a big hole on the side, will stitch myself as easier than returning and reordering.  Cute gloves."
3.0,They fit and feel great. Providing the right amount of support and water wicking.
3.0,"The material looks cheap and the dress runs small. I usually wear a size 8 or medium, but ordered a large. I'd need an XL to fit comfortably around my hips and midsection."
3.0,"I'm 5'2"" and 118 lbs.  This blouse in size S was too large for me.  I was swimming in it."
3.0,Waist way smaller than expected no stretch in the waist
3.0,"For what it costs, it's not bad. The glass was a little cloudy, but not unusable for its intended application.<br /><br />A little tip for folks shopping for jewelry in big box jewelry stores - pulling one of these out and even seeming to know what you're doing with it will give you a huge edge, since most sales tactics in places like that rely on your ignorance."
3.0,These are the size of an American large  and not a 2xl.
3.0,It will work but an extra large would have been better
3.0,"Great pattern, heavy nice material. The stitching is a sloppy mess on the front and back. I am a true 12/13 and although the dress fits it does cling the the midsection (I should have ordered a XL). It tends to ride up under the breast. Disappointed in the craftsmen ship."
3.0,"The sizing on these is way off.  Ordered the XL and ended up giving them to my niece who wears a size small and they were tight on her.  Nice shorts, but good luck ordering a size that properly fits."
3.0,"This dress is really pretty and fit great except for the bust. Just a bit too tight for my big bust. If you're not lugging around a couple of cannons, I'd imagine this would be an essential piece in the summer. Also doesn't have a built-in bra which is a big plus in my book."
3.0,"They are not bad by any means don't get me wrong they do there job but there are more cons than pros in my opinion and those being there heavy which is probably a good thing because a diesease can't get to you but it's bad to becausethey don't stretch very well, people can't hear you talk at all while whereing them and, and they are very hard to breath in"
3.0,I ordered large but they seem a little small.
3.0,"Very cute as a long distance relationship gift for my boyfriend when I moved to California. The font/print has remained with plenty of wear and tear on his key chain. However, within the first few days of having it, the US map had fallen off of the ring- the little O ring that attached it had broken and completely bent. The other charm with the writing on it has bent but we were able bent it back enough to keep it attached"
3.0,"Flattering, a tad tight in the chest/arm area."
3.0,I order this hat because of the color light purple but what I got it light blue as you can see the picture looks purple not blue or I might going blind?? I left 3 starts because of the color other wise hat its pretty very well made.
3.0,This band was ordered for a rose gold Fitbit. Unfortunately it does not come even close to matching the rose gold of the watch. It's a lovely band if only it matched the color. It's gone back.
3.0,"In the picture, it seemed bigger. This charm is TINY. Tiny as an earring. Not what I thought. Very pretty though."
3.0,"These goggles were a great value, but now I know why because neither laid flat on my face. Both were uneven and had gaps on either side. I like that they came with cases along with a little bag, but they just didn’t work for me."
3.0,They are super cute and really fuzzy but they do leave little fuzzy shedding on furniture and on my sheets the size for my foot fits fine but I thought they would be a little taller and I don’t know if they will last a long time the elastic on the top doesn’t seem to be that great that’s why I gave 3 stars but if you are just looking for cute cozy socks for inside during winter or because you have cold feet these will do the job
3.0,"The color is a pinkish kind of red.  Not just a true red.  It looks a little on the cheap side, but, it was cheap!"
3.0,Nice suit but not for curvy girls. was baggy in the mid section not for hourglass shapes.
3.0,Very tight on arms and chest. Ordered up but still fits wrong. The waist part is a little large and sits at an awkward place. It’s like between empire waisted and a normal fit so it sits above my waist and flares out making me look much larger. It has pockets though so that’s cool.
3.0,"I realize these glasses were very cheap to purchase, however, they're rather flimsy. Very lightweight. I wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,The package arrive fast about 2 week coming from across the ocean pretty fast.This necklace its nice. looks beautiful with alot of my looks and outfits. the only thing is that you only can wear it  just acouple of times because after a few uses it will turn dark and black.
3.0,Loved how these looked but not exactly what I was expecting. They are back lined with felt which was kind of weird. They were super heavy which was expected due to the beads... but because of this the post would just slide through the backing and fell off a few times. Thankfully I found the backing each time but that was just pure luck!
3.0,"This looks very clean and well built, and I appreciate the tool to adjust the size.  Unfortunately, the edges are so sharp and it made scratches and cuts after a few days' of wearing this.  I had to give up and ordered different kind similar to the original rubbery type.  It would have been perfect if the edges were round and smooth."
3.0,I'm not a large female and these seem more appropriate for a adolescence/teen. The frames are very small sized but the lens are decent.  I'll keep them for the price.
3.0,"Very bummed out about this small. I have tried several things to get rid of it such as letting it air out, washing with soap and warm water, spraying it with products, etc. It still has a mothballs smell. I can't use it and wish I could send it back. very cute set though"
3.0,I love this shirt & the fit. however there is a stain (white mark) going down the middle of the shirt when I received it. also there is no tag showing what it's made of or how to wash it.
3.0,It’s borderline “costume” jewelry.
3.0,The dress was good quality and a beautiful design  but it was too small.  I ordered the XXL and I gave it to my sister who wears a size M.
3.0,Very thin and runs large
3.0,"This was ok, it is not exceptionally warm, the fabric feels odd like polyester. It just did not have what i was looking for"
3.0,"I've had these for 3 months. I bought a pair of Nine West booties at the same time. I've worn both pairs about once a week since buying them. The Nine West we around $100 and still look brand new. These boots still look new on top, but the soles are all chipped and beaten up. I'm guessing the pair I bought was a 1/3 if what the others cost because they have poor quality soles."
3.0,The back of her foot hurt
3.0,"Quality of the socks are very good, they keep my feet warm and dry. Colors match photos and after roughly a month they are holding up fine. However the length is too short. I wear a size 10 (US shoe) and the sock barely goes above my ankle, makes me feel like I am wearing some sort of athletic sock.<br />If it was longer in size I would give it five stars."
3.0,One of the bracelets elastic sting came off one of the bracelets after I took it out the box.
3.0,"I bought these in a 1/2 inch for my ears, and unfortunately they didn't fit as wanted. They started off fine, but after they got wet multiple times, they constantly got stuck in my ears. I got lots of compliments on them, but they just didn't work for me and hurt me to wear."
3.0,Wasn't what I expected.  Kind of large and the criss cross in the front says. I thought it would look cute and kind of looked matronly on me.  Maybe if I bought 2 sizes smaller it would look better.
3.0,These are beautiful earrings going to progress that already there very fragile so be very very careful wearing them as I can snag and break off very easily but otherwise it's a great bye they're absolutely beautiful on and I would recommend them to anybody
3.0,"The material is strange, not your typical sweat shirt.  It is comfortable and perfect for an ugly sweater party!"
3.0,"It seemed larger to me, and skimpy in the back, not much ass coverage."
3.0,"This dress shoes every nook and cranny that you may have and is unforgiving.<br />While I had hoped to wear this out of the house, this is a house dress only for me."
3.0,"Hoodie seemed nice quality and has a weight to it. It's pretty warm and soft on the inside. I normally wear small but it seemed a little tight, maybe go up a size on these. Sadly mine came with a tear at the seam in the bottom... bad quality control I guess. Have to return mine :("
3.0,Dandelion is much smaller than expected and the clasp broke after two uses. It is still pretty though.
3.0,It looks good and good quality but I think the sizing is wrong. I ordered for my son a size 11.5 and it fits like a size 13. Inside the shoe says size 31. I’m returning.
3.0,"Black skirt with sash, that I'm saving for a funeral. The skirt is below knee length and has tiny pleats,.I'm not a big fan of pleats, though they are fashionable again. It's made of 100% Polyester and Machine Washable. Might be somebodies favorite, but not mine."
3.0,"I had to cut out the elastic, waist band was crazy tight! Shorts fit pretty good. A little on the thin side but still seem OK for workouts at the gym. Not my favorite shorts but didn't return them!"
3.0,"These were nice and came in the right size, but the pink and purple plugs came in completely different colors than in the photos. The purple ones came a lot darker and the pink ones are basically white. Other than that they're cute but I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy."
3.0,"They're ok. Not as shiny as pictured. They look kind of cheap, but then again they ARE cheap... I found the 8 mm to be too big for my taste."
3.0,"I am a huge fan of heart jewelry so when I found this heart pendant, I thought - I HAVE TO HAVE IT! But I was kind of disappointed when I received it. As someone mentioned on a previous comment, it has a weird, yellow tint on it that makes it look a lot less appealing than it appears on the picture."
3.0,"Was hoping it would have been cotton or at least a cotton blend. I like wearing this type of sock with my Converse shoes. Just enough to keep toes dry in the summer when feet tend to sweat. Still, these are ok, and they do stay in place inside your shoes. Worth getting."
3.0,"The shorts are cute and they fit well. My issue is they roll and ride up. Whether I was squatting, kicking or lunging, I had to pull them down. I have other shorts that I wear that don’t do this."
3.0,"As I write this, this blazer is priced at $39. That’s not expensive for a blazer, but I still think you can do better at this price point. It definitely looks cheaper, but my biggest complaint would be that the sleeves are so long. I don’t usually have an issue with sleeves running long on me,  but these are just long enough to look silly. I see in the listing the sleeves are pushed up. That definitely helps, but they won’t stay up on their own. It would be better to just get one with a 3/4 sleeve. I will say it’s nice it’s so lightweight for summer."
3.0,It's not a very solid case- chipped a lot. It looked pretty!
3.0,It was too small. Made Well but I can't use it.
3.0,"The tight are to small, I bought a large and they are to small and I am a fit person."
3.0,"unable to try on, physical problems make it impossible to put on"
3.0,"The general quality seems good enough, but I feel like the VW symbol won't last long and will easily rub off"
3.0,"Dress is cheaply made, but cute"
3.0,"Not as comfy as I had hoped.  I bought these based on the reviews that these would not bunch up on you in the nether regions.  They bunch up just like most other pairs of briefs I have purchased.  They feel great walking around, nice material, but they bunch up easily in dress pants throughout the day at work."
3.0,I liked the style and color but it wore out really fast. I have already had to replace it again.
3.0,Very large. Had to give to my husband
3.0,"I bought this cover 1 month before my international trip.  Previous covers I purchased would have holes in them by the time I arrived back home, but this cover withstood the baggage handlers abuse!  My only complaint is the zipper.  I noticed it was a little &quot;flimsy&quot; and not as durable as the zippers on my previous covers. By the time I arrived back home, it was broke.  I wish I could return it for another one.  I can honestly say I would purchase this again because the cover did its job and protected my luggage.  I just wish the zipper was still intact."
3.0,"I really wanted to love these, but they just look a lot bigger on my face than I expected. I’ll keep them for backup but wouldn’t necessarily get a second pair."
3.0,"Good service, no problems with shipping or anything, the Large size they are using is more like a small sized medium, but I still love the shirt"
3.0,Loved the shirt but had to send it back.  Turns out i needed to buy my boyfriend  a 3xl. Really wish the sizes went higher than 2xl
3.0,Wrong color the earrings were orange instead of yellow.
3.0,"I love how they feel, and fit. I do only wear them at home, or If I am going to go out I make sure to wear a very large shirt to cover my butt.  only reason I do that is due to the material being thin wish they would upgrade the material to something that doesn't show my panties!"
3.0,"Wasn’t thrilled. I was so excited to try it on, but the material felt a little cheap and one of the straps was very stretched out. Wouldn’t lay flat. One side also gaped out at the chest area while the other layed flat. I’m usually a M but the size chart recommended a L. Somewhere in the middle would have been good. Two small for a true sized L. I’m 5’10” 155 pounds. Possibly could have gone with a medium? Returning because I don’t want to wait for another shipment. So sad because it looked cuter online."
3.0,I ordered a size up and it is a little too snug for my liking and it turns my armpits pink anytime I wear it. Great material but not worth the money.
3.0,"Completely see-thru on the butt....other than that, they are pretty good leggings"
3.0,My son's class is going to the NFL Hall of Fame and we wanted him to have a new shirt. While this shirt will do the front images are so off center. Fortunately my son won't care but I would expect more from an NFL item.
3.0,SMALLER LENSES THAN PICTURED BUT OK
3.0,"Purchased because I wasn't sure what &#34;Acrylic&#34; material was or how it felt when I wore it. Decided I didn't like it very much; the texture of the material feels almost like cloth-cardboard.<br /><br />That said, the size 8 hat is fairly large, as the label describes -- it fits big heads well."
3.0,It's OK. Didn't fit right in some places.
3.0,"does seems real, but o.k."
3.0,Wish it had a lobster claw clasp or a ring on other end instead of just a prong.
3.0,"I love the look and feel of this jacket. I followed the size chart and ordered a medium. The medium would not even sip pass my chest. I ordered the large and  zips however, the problem is the sleeves they are awkwardly made it's tight and feels like they are sewn way to far back making the jacket feel small."
3.0,"eh, was disappointed by the shape. These are VERY cat-eyeish."
3.0,"This swimsuit is gorgeous and looks great on. The problem for me was the removable pads inside. I usually take them out. When I did with this swimsuit, there was ZERO support so I decided to put them back in. Well, while swimming, the stupid things kept &#34;floating&#34; up into the top of the halter area! Very annoying. I kept fiddling with it, and felt like the girls were gonna pop out at any moment. Which would be ok if it was only me and my husband in the pool, but we weren't alone. I'm not going to wear it again. It's cute tho..."
3.0,"The dress is very well made, but it runs very small. It is also very short. All in all it is a very nice dress."
3.0,My bf loved this but the dangling bit fell off just a few days after putting it on his keys.
3.0,"I like it, it doesn’t smell I don’t know what some of these reviewers are on but it’s wool fool. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it’s a bit larger if you wear an XL buy a large. Another thing the color isn’t what you get it’s more brown than an off whiteish color."
3.0,"I bought this skirt for my sorority recruitment. The fabric was a little difficult to get over the buttons but it worked for the day. When I took it off at the end of the day, the two buttons were yanked off their holes. I ended up having to superglue the pieces back together. It is a poorly and cheaply made skirt but it does have pockets so that's a plus."
3.0,Not enough arch support
3.0,"nice design but very delicate, the chain was broken first day!"
3.0,"I got these today and the size and colors are fine, but there are only 9 in the package, not 10. I'm missing the clear one. It doesn't matter right now because I'm switching from my original clear corkscrew one so I probably wouldn't use the clear one anyway, but it's still kind of a bummer. The rest of them are nice and vibrant, though, and they look to be in good condition."
3.0,Esta botas son de muy mala calidad yo d8go que no son originales.pues se mancharon y ya estan muy fea.
3.0,It said it was true to size and it was too big. I just gave it to a friend. No biggie. More trouble to send it back so I gave it away.
3.0,"The fabric may be cutting edge but seemed closer to a soft pure cotton, not like the active shirts I prefer. The shirt fit just fine, but the sleeves were so loose around my arms it felt and looked a little strange on me."
3.0,Nice watch but. But it has a Chinese written weekdays. Things that I don't need.
3.0,I love this dress but the one I received was cut crooked. The bottom part has a little slit on each side and the slits were cut wrong. One was almost in front of my left knee while the other one was almost behind my right knee. Sadly I’m returning it. I may reorder and see if I have better luck with another one.
3.0,I have been wearing a pair of these in gray and love them.  These are ok but the fabric is a little less soft and comfy.  Like the other pair they are a little large on arrival but  fit very well after washing.  They wash and tumble dry just fine.  Just wish there was a way to understand fabric differences between colors.
3.0,"Nice shirt, but I had to send it back because it fit a little small."
3.0,The item was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. I'm sure the description in the ad was accurate but I was surprised when I got it.
3.0,I ordered this at a reduced rate.  I received it very quickly.  Color is stunning.  Material seems very nice.  The only problem is that I ordered a medium and it fits more like a large or an extra large.  I weigh about 134 and wear a size 6 to 8 so medium should have been the size I would wear.  I love the flow of the skirt and the slits for the legs just really wish it fit me.  Will send back.  If the cut is same in all the dresses I am not sure a small would even fit me.
3.0,"These are really comfortable shoes, but I run an even 6.5-7 size shoe and it was way too big, even with thick wool socks.  They kept slipping on my feet.  I'd like to order a smaller size, but they are more expensive.  I don't know why that would be."
3.0,"While it fits incredibly tight in the legs, it is fairly stretchy. The waist was a bit too small. I normally wear a 36, but I probably could have went up a size in these. They are definitely post weight loss pants."
3.0,Cute shirt; but if you have a larger bust size it lays weird on your chest.
3.0,Comfy n dressy too.
3.0,"Well, I loved these when I tried them out in the pool. Fit was great and very comfortable. Didn't leak or pinch my nose. But, when I was done and some drops of water got into the inside right eye, I used the provided cloth and tried gently wiping out or dabbing water and the inside is now scratched. I won't be able to see clearly in the right eye. I saw no warning saying not to use the provided cloth to wipe the inside. A bit disappointed."
3.0,"Im disappointed, from such brand and for such price you would expect better quality.<br />Material is toooooo thin , you would wash it maybe 5 times and is tearing apart.<br />Desing is unique and cool , bit , I wouldn't buy it again. Better to find some other brand who offers you the quality of the price you pay for.  I would give 5 dollars for this."
3.0,"It comes apart!!! Hurts your head, makes marks. But is super pretty and cute!!"
3.0,"These pants are super comfortable but unlike the reviews say, these are definitely see through, I don't even need to bend over or squat down to see through them. They are comfortable and they look good as long as you are wearing something that covers your butt. I even sized up. They are not super restricting or compressing though and I do love that. They are great for weekends and lounging."
3.0,You can see the seem of the corset through a tight dress thus making it not worth wearing.
3.0,ute but very thin and delicate
3.0,"the material is comfy. It got kind of see through but its a white bikini, you always run that risk. The big kicker for me, was the cup size was incredibly small. I have a small chest (B cup) and I felt like I would have a spillage situation at any moment. For my girls who dont mind that, fantastic! But I personally like my ladies to stay in there assigned seats at the waterpark, to each there own!"
3.0,"It is as advertised.  Pulled on like a sock and fits as high as the size of your calf will allow, as it fits like an ace bandage with limited stretch ability.  I can pull it up to my knee but it is not as comfortable there as at the top of my boots.  I tested with cards and cash and have no problems with those.  Tested with a Passport and there is no way I'll carry that in this wallet.<br /><br />I'll keep it and may use it some but It won't hold much and will be my alternate or spare concealed wallet."
3.0,the ears were folded when they came but really cute when they stand. Vail is absolutely too short for adult. Had to cut it off and add on another layer of fabric myself for it to look good. Result was great after the altering.
3.0,"Ordered these to compliment an iron man shirt, but the colors were not as vibrant as the shirt. These leave nothing to the imagination, so if that's what you're into for working out then they're great; but for walking around on Halloween with kids...  no."
3.0,These are very hot!
3.0,I ordered this as part of Amazon's Black Friday promo. I wanted to like this necklace - I really did!<br /><br />But when it came it just didn't seem all that great a quality. I can't put my finger on exactly why - just that it didn't look like a quality piece. Just hit me as blah.<br /><br />I'm sure others love it. Personal taste/impression is just that - personal and subjective. This just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />I returned it and will say the return process was painless.
3.0,"I had to wash this item.  I love how it fits and look on me.  It had a smell in the crouch and the protective tag for underwear were missing. I like to order more of this product, but I will return it if it smells.  Due to time of my event, I choose to wash this item on my first order.  I am very disappointed that I need to wash it upon arrival."
3.0,Came in late and I ordered thru prime and also it was ripped(front and back) it actually looks like scissor snips!
3.0,"The finger lights are kind of cute, but deliver less light than newer LED technology. The cases are cheap plastic and there is no  provision for changing the batteries (which discharge run down much faster than I expected. 5 of the 40 did not work, so don't expect 100%reliability."
3.0,"This is sized way too small. These are kid sized. I read reviews that said to size up.  So I got a 2XL for comfort because I like loose sleepwear. I'd say this is at best a petite med/large when comparing to other clothes I own. For comparison, my 8 year old's size 8/10 shirts and shorts are longer. After carefully following the washing directions, the set shrunk further to a medium. They look nice but aren't comfortable for me because I like wearing loose shorts that don't ride up when I sleep because they're so short. It doesn't matter how nice they may look if I can't even comfortably wear them."
3.0,They were ok fit small
3.0,"I love the style of the sunglasses, however when I opened the package the right 'fold' of the sunglasses already had scruff marks on em' I'm not too picky about it but wish it didn't have em' Overall pretty decent."
3.0,"I loved the color and the style of the pants, however I had to return them due to the fabric being see-through."
3.0,"Detail and quality are great but it runs very small and isn't elastic enough to move with my body. I'm 5'2 and 140lbs, built curvy and this was too snug to be comfortable. I bought a lg"
3.0,Very disappointed with the quality. The jacket zippers were all broken.
3.0,I worry that the pins may not hold the band in place but otherwise the watch looks good.
3.0,"I love this shirt, but after ONE wash the neck was flopping.  Fits awesome!"
3.0,Thinner material than expected and shipping was ridiculously slow.
3.0,"Cute design, but the edge of the fabric rolls so you can’t see the lips. Also, once you stretch it to put it over your head the fabric stays stretched. Spend a couple of extra dollars and get a quality Buff head band."
3.0,"To large, having a hard time trying to find right size."
3.0,"The bag is functionally what I was looking for but when it arrived it had an awful strong smell to it.  After a couple of weeks and some lysol it smells better. It works and holds a lot of stuff. The cons are the removable compartment for your laptop shifts a bit at the bottom so pens, lipstick can slide between sides. I also don't like that it's not stiff enough to stand up on it's own. So when it's full you have to lean it up against the wall or chair. All in all I use it for work so I don't have to carry a laptop bag and a purse but I may purchase another bag."
3.0,Fitb was off
3.0,Not loving the stiff material.
3.0,Todo me gusta esepto la corbatina oh chonga
3.0,"Cool design, but its made for a big and tall pregnant man"
3.0,"Looks and feels cheap, I can see the glue on the background where they join the turquoise inlay with the tree, it is so disappointing. For the price I think this is too much, should be less expensive. Of course the turqoise is simulated as advertised and feels light and false. The size is good."
3.0,"The material of this dress is strange.  I’m not sure I would want to wear it out, but it was an excellent option for a bathing suit cover up!"
3.0,Beautiful dress but is still too small when following the size guide. The neckline does not lay properly.
3.0,"Just received yesterday and pulled the cap out to wear in the OR today, toggle clip has already broken off before I could wear for the first time. Otherwise, it’s a beautiful cap."
3.0,The dress color is not white but an ivory color. Advertising as white.
3.0,I got it for the 2 windows .....good quality
3.0,Nice looking pendant but the locket hinge is a little lose and doesn't lock in place so easily and doesn't always stay shut.  But the price is ok.  Cheap price fits the quality.  I plan on adding a piece of felt to the center and using this as an essential oil diffuser necklace.
3.0,Fits perfect on the suitcase but the material is very cheap but for the price it’s OK
3.0,"not worth the time in sending back, this is used for my housekeepers, they say not worth."
3.0,"Great for a non-walker but the sole of the feet do not line up properly in the foot so not good for standing or walkers. Inside is very soft and warm. Good for keeping baby's feet warm in the winter. I was hoping for something she could stand in in her walker. These are not them, but very cute."
3.0,was too big and had to return.  Did not like style enough to try and reorder
3.0,It felt like I was grown to college while in a sexy relationship except with a bit too nonbreathable fabric with small waste bands that brings me back to reality.
3.0,"I paid almost $8 for the set. Overall it is good...for the season, literally. The antlers are the best part. Will be in good shape for next year, but not the nose. For some reason the fabric won't hold. It stretched out to the point that you can tell it will tear soon. The wires off of the nose are not attached to a firm place inside the nose, just the fabric. Yet. I took it off on time and so I think that if I reinforce the back somehow, it will be good for next year as well. Shipping is fast, packaging is actually well done, everything is faithful to the pics on the seller's website."
3.0,"Didn’t like the material, it was two sizes too big."
3.0,"The shirt is cute, but definitely irritating when the actual shirt you expect to purchase is not even the same quality shirt . The neck part was wider and no tag to even show a size. The image shows a completely different shirt with a tag. The sizing of the print seems smaller than the picture itself as well."
3.0,Adorable but pants are very thin material
3.0,top too large and bottom way too too small
3.0,Not great materials.  Too small for a mans head.
3.0,I always wear a small in running clothes. This small was too small and shorter than it looked in the picture.  i requested a return but have not heard back from the seller at all.
3.0,"Fleece tends to run large in my opinion, these were no different. Ordered regular size and was not able to get good use out of them due to length of pants being too long."
3.0,The sleeves are a little short and the overall quality of the blouse is cheap. I would not purchase this brand again.
3.0,Quality could be better & ran small
3.0,"Love the color and design.  Found the fit to be a little off.  The neck is higher than I like and one of the arm holes feels incorrect.  I may have just gotten a messed up one.  I'm still able to wear it.  Nobody probably notices, but me."
3.0,This dress it’s gorgeous on but the smell is nauseating! It smells like rotten fish. I received it a few days ago and I’m still trying to air it out. Every person that I showed could smell the fabric from 4-5 ft away. I’m praying the smell goes away with time. Luckily I have time before I need this dress. This would’ve gotten 5 stars had it not been for the smell. I’ll be returning if the smell doesn’t go away.
3.0,Pretty dress however it made my hips look big because of the cut and excess material otherwise very cute. I am 5'5 185 lbs. 36D
3.0,These boots don't hold up long. After about 2 or 3 wears  these boots look like my daughter has had them for months.
3.0,"I bought this to wear under my work vest. The work vest is too heavy and decreases air movement, but on its own it’s great! Runs small."
3.0,These would be cool but the leg zippers are too jagged and poke and gouge your legs. Less brutal zippers would make these five star.
3.0,It's a lovey shirt but a bit small
3.0,"They aren't ""no show"""
3.0,Liked the look but unable to see the date or the imprint
3.0,"I almost didn't purchase this handbag after reading some of the reviews especially about the handle strap being on backwards. But the bag I received had the handle strap attached correctly (see image). I purchased this handbag over others because of the center divider, but I should have listened to other reviews because the center divider is almost worthless. It does not extend to the top of the bag so it doesn't divide anything. It merely blocks you from getting into one side or the other. I am thinking about removing it completely and resewing the inside liner. All that said, the handbag is very well made. It is sturdy, the zippers are nice, metal and the leather is soft. I have had some problems with the  &#34;B&#34; on the metal logo on the front of the bag grabbing my clothing, but that could be specific to the handbag I received. Although a little disappointed with the center divider, I still like carrying this handbag."
3.0,The logo was stitched crooked onto the hat.
3.0,"Arrived when promised but it was much, much smaller than I had anticipated it would be - you can't even read the inscription.  Would not recommend this for anyone to purchase."
3.0,"The cups are not shaped right. If you have large breasts, you'll slowly fall out of the cups all day. I wore it once, and this was an all day battle."
3.0,They are nice i just dont like the packge was so bad and dint come with a bag.
3.0,"I thought I read the size chart correctly to get this for my son who wears a large youth shirt. Most users said it was too small so I figured it would be perfect for him. It is true to size - I wear an adult medium and it fits a tad big. He wears it as a night shirt since it comes almost to his knees. But the picture on the shirt and quality were just what I was expecting and he loves it, even if it fits like a dress."
3.0,"I was hoping this belt would be stiffer.  It is very flexible, looks nice, is probably very sturdy.  It just doesn’t suit my particular needs.  It is also a little shorter than I expected, I have a 38 inch waist and it barely fits."
3.0,They are cute shorts but they ride up a lot. And the high waist slides down. I don't wear them around anyone so they don't have to see my backside hanging out.
3.0,TOO SHORT THERE IS NO MUCH ROOM FOR ADJUSTMENT
3.0,SUPER THIN MATERIAL
3.0,"Pretty, but didn't fit."
3.0,The round posts are too big and too heavy.
3.0,"Inseam is way too short, 28 inches."
3.0,I disliked the chain. Bought another one!
3.0,"It is far too short on me to wear as a dress, so I use it as cute shirt!"
3.0,"This  material is as described, but it's a bit larger than my measurements and I did follow their size guide. Also, I'd advise getting a petticoat to put underneath."
3.0,It was not as expected.
3.0,I ordered a small but received an extra small.  They fit ok so I kept them.  This is the third time I received the wrong size from amazon.
3.0,"Bought for my brother.  It's just as cool and soft-knit as it appears in photos, but he has one complaint.  Other people can hear the music played through it, and it's pretty noticeable.  Still good for use...just perhaps not in public?"
3.0,"The earring itself was shorter than I expected, but still pretty."
3.0,Cute dress but I did not like the material. It was very thin. The material is stretchy and silky on the top and the skirt was a little heavy but the same silky material. I would’ve liked a cotton material.
3.0,If you have a fat stomach..its a No...pretty much true to size...loved it but will give it away..quality is cheap
3.0,"This is cute, I guess I didn’t realize i will have to take the whole thing off to use the bathroom lol.<br />I bought xl (this is from China, so China sizing).<br />I am 5’5” 140lb for reference, and the xl fit."
3.0,the bracelets are so cute to be honest. but they are in a larger size. i have small wrists and they just don’t fit that well
3.0,I ordered white socks and was sent dark gray. I didn't have the wherewithal to return them but would never have ordered that color. They are ugly but work ok.
3.0,"Swimsuit season is way over!  (PA in November), but the SONJA BETRO Women's Crinkled Woven Lace Trim V-Neck Cape Tunic Kaftan is something I am looking forward to for next season.  Finding a coverup where you don't look like your mother has always been a challenge for me.  You want to look cute, but it needs to actually be functional.  I think this ""Kaftan"" fits the bill.  I received the medium and I would've preferred a large.  I felt for my 5'10"" height it was a bit too short.  Even though it's just a coverup, if I'm wearing it you still not be able to see my crotch regardless of if I am I wearing a swimsuit or not.  It's see through so if you are trying to wear this as a top beware.  It didn't really swing right on the hips on the sides.  So, that is probably why I would prefer a large over a medium.  The fabric is also somewhat staticky.  I felt like it clung to my body when it was supposed to swing around.  Overall, I like the styling, but the execution was not so great."
3.0,"With it being over-sized, it creates a puffy sleeve with tight wrists.<br />Super thin material."
3.0,The color is great! Love the short sleeves and length. But it doesn’t close at all. I feel it is too small around.
3.0,Used it on vacation and it was ok confortable
3.0,"THIS WAS A GIFT, QUALITY WAS POOR."
3.0,Needed to order two sizes bigger! Runs small! Cute dress though! Guess I'll have some weight to lose!
3.0,I use one of these for breakfast every day as I'm diabetic and should stay away from sugar cereals.
3.0,It is a very comfortable support shirt but I don’t like the fact that it rides up and does not  support my back like other shirts that I’ve tried
3.0,Don't care for the material.  Cotton? More like poly or spandex.
3.0,To small don’t like the material even xxl was to small
3.0,"Even though I got out a ruler to judge how big it would be...it was way bigger than I imagined.  Still the quality and the look of the bag were awesome, just didn't want it that big.  I had to return"
3.0,"these earrings are cute, but they are a little heavy. i had to take them out after an hour when they became uncomfortable."
3.0,I have had it for a few days and already several gems have fallen out.  And I have't even been rough with it!
3.0,The color was on point and the fits was perfect. My only issue was I washed it before I put it on and it beaded up. The frizz balls were a lot. I had to get a clothes shaver.
3.0,"They are more like leggings than an exercise pant, runs large"
3.0,"I do like this shirt, but it is nothing like pictured. The color of the tshirt is a dark blue, not a baby blue. The graphics is really faded looking. I do beleive that is the intended look. It is really nice, looks kinda like a ""junk food tee"". The quality is great, but runs small as all pepsi promotion products do. Buy a size larger than normal. Great gift item for men. I am getting tshirts and saving them for christmas because we drink so much pepsi we have everything that was worth the points already (and some items that were a total waste of points.)"
3.0,"I've washed these 3 times, I even washed with vinegar and the odor of the dye is still strong.  They are cute and fit as expected, but i won't wear them because of the smell."
3.0,"It's such a cool bracelet, but the strings begin to fray and the hold just doesn't keep. It starts to loosen as I'm going about my day till it's just spinning around my wrist. I love the insect inside, but I really wish the band was more durable."
3.0,"The good: lightweight, pretty layered style and a beautiful bright red.<br />The bad: tight in some areas and too loose in others, so doesn’t fit properly, but since I hate returning things unless it’s very awful, I’m keeping it to wear around the house."
3.0,Beautiful bathing suit but not long enough to cover my romp!
3.0,Weird neon stripe through this pattern.  Very soft and as expected otherwise
3.0,I love it! ALTHOUGH- it is sent very tangled. I am afraid of breaking the chain because it is very cheap. But i love this chain & it is a great way to spice up a bikini or cute crop top
3.0,"These sandals look really cute, but the elastic feels very slippy, like they will not be comfortable to walk around in. I sent them back."
3.0,Needs about 5 more beads
3.0,Only giving three stars because my grandson hasn’t used the boots in snow yet but he does like the style and fit.
3.0,"Returned it, material and quality not as expected also fit small."
3.0,"I have not received this yet, but it is adorable, and I can't wait to get it!"
3.0,Era un encargo y le ha fascinado ala mamá del niño
3.0,This is super cute but WAY small! Short and just generally small. But definitely cute and holly jolly!
3.0,"This is a nice set of long (6inch) boxer briefs. I like the length a lot.  The ""package area"" is well defined and holds well. The elastic is decent, not too strong but not loose. These are a true large.  So they are on the looser side but still fit me well. After a wash, no doubt they will fit better.  These are ""pull down"" underwear, with no opening in front. So you have to ""pull down"" to pee.  That's not so good for me.  So the designer sacrificed the opening for a better hold at the groin. Depends on how you 'go' whether this will be an issue or not.  Certainly should make them last longer, with less area to tear or fray.  Overall, a decent priced set of cotton boxer briefs."
3.0,"Looks good, but clasp is hard to use"
3.0,"Nice product, but the shirt was too small."
3.0,the zipper broke right away
3.0,"Gift for two preschool/ kindergarten girls, they loved them but the socks were slightly smaller then anticipated"
3.0,I don't know if I will ever wear this other than outside my house.  The bottoms are extremely skimpy and ran fairly small.  The top doesn't fit well either -if your cup size is any larger than a C I wouldn't even bother.  I might fit better in a L or XL of this suit and normally I'm a S/M.
3.0,Dress did not fit right
3.0,"I ordered a medium, and it's closer in size to an XL."
3.0,I didnt receive my belt for this product. The outfit fit great
3.0,"I broke most of these already but maybe I was asking to much of them. I was using them with webbing cam strap to hold stuff like a cooler and tote down in my van. It doesn't take much to break the clip, just snugging the strap up to the cooler broke two of them. I'm sure they are fine when used for a strap on a rifle or backpack."
3.0,I ordered a large but this is so big. I wore it after too much sun as it was super loose but won't get much wear out of it otherwise. Super soft and quality was fine.
3.0,Super cute but arrived broken in two places. Thankfully I have jewelry making supplies so I was able to fix it but not everyone will have that option!
3.0,Material is on thin side. Almost can see my cottage cheese with grey skirt. Long too but...waist band can be folded over and skirt pulled up
3.0,The small bracelets are really small...my 10 year old has tiny wrists and these barely fit her. We waited forever for them to be shipped so we didn't want to send them back and order a new set though so she is just wearing them.
3.0,"Rather cheap looking, but ok for the price. You get what you pay for. I gave them away."
3.0,The dress is beautiful but a litter shorter than I expected. The material is nice and the lace is a nice touch.
3.0,"Shorter and tighter than expected, will pass on to someone else."
3.0,Was a good fit.  Pleased.
3.0,These are NOT Z87 safety certified.
3.0,"I'm positive I was sent a smaller carat than I ordered It is as small as a 1/4 or smaller. I'm going to keep them but would be happier if I had the right size. Otherwise, they sparkle very nicely."
3.0,This shirt has a Gucci vibe but runs small. Had to return.
3.0,Loved the dress but runs small.
3.0,"It is a little see through. Nothing major<br /><br />I would like a smaller size (I got small, have volume and it still fit a bit lose so if you are slim this will fit baggy which is not cute)<br /><br />Beware of the orange one. I got it and the first thing i said was wo! Orange can no be the new black. Looks cool in the pic but in person you look like a sexy fashion inmate. I would get the darker tones in smaller size"
3.0,Me quedo un poco mas grande de lo que esperaba y la tela no me gusto. el diseño y el color es muy lindo así que lo ajuste a mi medida.
3.0,"I'm content with my purchase. I was expecting to receive different style of industrial barbells as depicted in the second photograph, but was disappointed to see all of the barbells were the same spiral style. Also missing a couple colors from the set as well. Be cautious of this purchase you may only receive the one style."
3.0,"It's cute, but it's very stretchy material (not cotton based at all), so even the bigger size ran really small. Keeping it, but it's not my favorite shirt I've ever purchased."
3.0,"Not my favorite pair of elastics to date.  After one foray I pulled them out and went back to original laces.  A good product, just not for me."
3.0,"This brand fits TTS.  I got a medium in white. 5’4” and a 36D chest. The color is not a starch white, it’s more of a creamy light ivory. The inside is not thick fleece, it’s a thin brushed fleece which will pill and it’s color is a starch white. You get what you pay for, but it is comfy for inside wear."
3.0,Beautiful!! But Broke after only wearing twice
3.0,"While it is very very very cute, it is very tiny. My 11 year old is normally a size XS and we bought a medium and it is entirely way too small. Fits like a size XS. It is cute though. Just buy a few sizes bigger."
3.0,"These are cute but get in the way a bit. They’re also not too effective if the sun is direct, like when driving west. BUT-they’re fun and make my glasses look a little less stodgy."
3.0,The shorts fit true to size. The top is a different story. Comfy material just wish the top stretched at least.
3.0,Low quality material but I liked the pattern
3.0,"Nice belt, haven't really given it the durability test yet since I have only worn it once.  It is a little pricey."
3.0,"While the socks are very cute, they are super thin and stretch out waaaayyy too easily.  They don’t stay up over the knee which means you have to keep pulling them up which causes even more stretching.  Upset that I got 3 pairs. As I stated before they’re thin as well so don’t expect to be warm in these."
3.0,"I went by the size chart, but, it was just a weeee bit large on me.  The pattern is cool, but the fit just wasn't the best on me."
3.0,"There's a lot to like.  The overall fit was perfect (small).  The fabric is a nice medium weight and even though it came sort of wadded up in a box, when I put it on it looked like it had just been pressed -- no wrinkles at all and draped nicely.  BUT as mentioned in a few other reviews, the waistline is WAY too high.  The picture makes it look like the seam is approximately waist height, but when I put it on, it's more like an empire (under the bust) waistline.  Too high even for a wide belt to cover.  Too bad -- I really liked everything else about it.  But it's going back."
3.0,"Not for support, but comfy after a wash"
3.0,super snuggly but they flip around which is hazardous with mobility issues. Going for barre socks.
3.0,These glasses are just a little too light need to be just slightly darker for the extra bright led headlights no complaints otherwise.
3.0,The fit was good.  However the material the dress is made from is a lesser quality than I expected from Amazon. The color was just as displayed.
3.0,"For the most part I like the bracelet it’s cute, but it wasn’t finished off nicely as the stretch band strings were sticking out that needed to be cut."
3.0,I love the blouse but it came with a line across the back as if the thread was pulled.. (a snag more like) I kept it as I was wearing it to a function in hopes it wasnt too noticeable. Or else I would have given this top 5 stars.
3.0,"I love the feel of this sweater. It is a nice, soft 100% cotton v-neck. Beautiful color that hasn’t faded a bit. So what’s not to like? It’s 100% cotton, so shrinkage happens. I went from a perfect fitting, slim fit sweater to a sweater that has changed 1 full size in 2 washings. It was never washed in any temperature above cold, nor was it dried with heat although it was tumbled in the dryer to help keep it from wrinkling. I should have gone up 1 size because it is cotton and if I see it on sale, I just might repurchase it larger."
3.0,I was looking for something that was more flexible to use when I golfed
3.0,"A little short for a long length tie. Otherwise, no complaints"
3.0,"It sits crooked. As we were sewing Mickey ears in, it made our job quite challenging"
3.0,The black coloring in the writing (love) faded really bad after just one wash. Otherwise it fit well and it a cute top.
3.0,"Got this for my brother who is size 46, it barely tied around him."
3.0,The glasses a little thicker than I expected. Not really as big a frame as I expected.
3.0,"Love it got complements but waayyyyy bigger than i thought, Size down 1 or 2 sizes suggested..."
3.0,Smaller than anticipated but cute
3.0,"The necklace was pretty, but the card was poor quality and print. That put a damper on it, when my friend had trouble reading it."
3.0,I used the sizing chart and its not true to that.
3.0,I really liked the pattern and used it as part of a Halloween costume but I had to fold down the top and pin it because too much of the eye part showed. All night I had to keep adjusting the fold. In the picture it was only the very bottom of the black surrounding the eye but mine went up to the bottom of the actual eye. I matched the make up for the rest of my face. The costume was a hit. I would've given it more stars if it had been just like the picture and I didn't have to hassle with folding it all night.
3.0,Broke/bent after only having a short while.
3.0,"In my option, it was more medium size than large size. Except for that, a nice bag"
3.0,"very nice for the price... but unbelievable glare in direct sunlight, be warned<br />unfortunately i've lost close to $300 worth of real ray-bans in cabs and restaurants in the past yr or so...<br />so for now, this will do nicely"
3.0,"The buckle wears very quickly and will no longer stay attached to the adjustable portion of the belt.  Also, the “leather” of the bet is very thin and cracked early on."
3.0,Awesome glasses they feel really durable and strong solid frames nice UV coating and protection but the zipper on the glasses case they come in arrived broken which is frustrating would be a 5 star review if the case wasn't damaged
3.0,"Cheap ring to hang on the necklace, but nice. I'll change the cord, too."
3.0,"It's a nice shirt, but I didn't know it was polyester."
3.0,A little tight and doesn't offer much support
3.0,just as the reviews said kinda thin and cheap and zipper isn’t good quality but cute and fit largely c: and i bought it cuz it was cheap and it’s still cute!! Get it if you can’t afford a super cool one cuz this one is just as good!
3.0,I ordered a large it fits but arms are tight & it feels too snug.  Sizing is off
3.0,Had a kinda weird fit on my body and zero support
3.0,"Not as brushed metal as it appears in the pic, but still a good value."
3.0,"The fingertips don't always allow phone use, have to remove the glove in the cold to use the phone."
3.0,"I thought I was ordering the white one - like in the picture, but I got the black one.  Also it's printed a little off-center... But it's still nice. It its well (I'm 5'5&#34; and 115lbs and there was an M sticker on the package)"
3.0,the back does NOT open or clasp (like a bra) so it is very difficult to get in and out of
3.0,"Did not know this was made in China. Sad to say I'm a little disappointed. The picture shows a &#34;blue&#34; color, but the watch is black. Other watches like this are shown correctly, black. In reading the manual, there are many spelling errors, which makes me think the quality of the watch might be the same. A little early to determine the accuracy of time keeping. Shipping date was terrible, missed the date by 4 days."
3.0,"These were great stocking stuffers and they are fun for kids and the cat too! They are a little hard to turn on and off and some of them don't work as well as I'd like, but we are enjoying the ones we got to work a lot."
3.0,Good quality...but just too small
3.0,"I ordered XL (for waist size 31, 32, 33) and my size is 32.<br />I expected a perfect fit, but it was a bit too big for me.<br />The quality of the fabric seems to be nice for its price."
3.0,"Fits small.  Buy a larger than normal size.<br />Otherwise, it’s super comfy."
3.0,they started getting really loose fast to the point that they were falling off. They're super cute though.<br />.
3.0,I liked the color but the fit was too small. I would order one size up from your true size.
3.0,"Watch arrived today, but no chains. Description mentions chain included. Too bad, it's beautiful but useless to me without the chain."
3.0,"I don't totally love this bad. Online, it looks super nice, but you might not realize at first that only the top part is leather. The main section of the bag is a different material and not as high quality or attractive. There's plenty of space for everything, but I'd prefer a bag that was fully leather."
3.0,It's beautiful and fits perfect.. BUT I ordered ivory and it is definitely not ivory... it is white.
3.0,"These shoes were really cute but after my son had only worn them a few times, a piece broke. The hole were the strap goes through has a metal piece there, It came undone and fell off. Disappointed that these fell apart so quick."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress but it was not as well made as I expected. Not as flowy as I expected (models are deceiving) and the seam was off centered making the dress fit poorly. I did love the material as it was light weight, making it a perfect summer time dress."
3.0,order a couple sizes up if you want it to fit right.
3.0,Pretty but small in personand make is ok .
3.0,"I like the sweatshirt for the most part, but I had a large issue when it came to the decals(the white design parts). Parts of the design on the front AND on the arms peeled off after a couple washes."
3.0,Size chart is difficult to go by...I wear a 10~ 101/2 women's which means I have to order a 10 or 11 in most cases since they usually don't make a 10 1/2.  I ordered a XL per other comments.  The XL is slightly too big.  I should have ordered the large for a better fit.  I do not think these would stay on walking in water with sand or mud bottom.  Other than that for the money they are ok.  I don't expect them to last for more than casual use.
3.0,The material of the top is not what I expected. It's not a cotton. It's like a waterproof material. Kinda weird but other than that I liked the top.
3.0,Ordered a 34 but fits like a 32/33 waist.
3.0,"I thought this top was a sweater, but it's a knit top. Quality is ok and sizing seems true to size, but I'll be returning because it's not what I expected. Red color seems true to image posted."
3.0,"It didn't fit in my piercing, it was too short. I bought quite a few earrings with all the same length and this was the only one that was too short. It fit my sister though, she loves it."
3.0,"I thought the thumb holes would have been stitched, it was just cut."
3.0,"The edges are not finished, they are just overcast. It was so cheap that it isn't worth sending back."
3.0,This product didnt fit well at all. Smaller than expected. Made for skinny people only. The price was good and product was received early then expected.
3.0,It's a spandex material and very tight fitting. Not loose & flowy like the picture. Was way too small for my girl
3.0,I read the reviews and suggestions and went with an XL (I wear a 14).  I should have sized up as this dress was very snug and would not zip up on me.  I am trying to lose weight anyway and so will keep it.  It is made well and is very cute.
3.0,I honestly don’t know how to feel about this bonnet but I for sure did have more comfortable ones in the past yeah it’s pretty but without the comfort the bonnet isn’t really worth much to me and that drawstring I hate it.
3.0,It’s nice thanks.
3.0,Fits small and the pants are not as nice as the one in the photo and it is very thin and not the best quality at all. It all feels very cheap.
3.0,Gloves were well made and fit well.  Was expecting them to be in the brown family not gray.
3.0,"Was a great length for my height 5’4” but the waist was not all that flattering. Soft material. Green as a deeper green than shown and material is very soft and hangs close to body, I thought it was more structured material in the photo. Medium fit me and I’m 158lbs. Just not a great cut for my curvy body type."
3.0,Era para mi madre le quedó muy pequeño ! Esta lindo pero para persona flaca
3.0,I little difficult to use. Doesn't pull down over face so easily.
3.0,Fit was too small and material was scratchy. Would not recommend this item.
3.0,Nice but doesn't lay well
3.0,The pieces are all a good size but the material is hard plastic and looks cheap
3.0,Nice material and captions were clever
3.0,"Very disappointed at how small the bra is. I am processing a return. The craftsmanship is absolutely amazing, but I think somehow someone may think all women are the same circumference in the bra area regardless of the rest of their body. It is embarrassingly small. There's no way I'd feel comfortable wearing this with anyone seeing it. The cup size was fine for me (B don't bother if you're a C or above)<br /><br />3 stars for the workmanship.  Could've been five if there was an understanding of the anatomy of a larger size woman.<br /><br />I wear a size 12 to 14 depending on manufacturer.  This bra is made for someone around a size 8. Believe the reviews."
3.0,didn't care for these. weird see through material and also was kind of scratchy is the best way to put it. thought it would be cool because of the way the pockets are on these is different and i liked them but the material is just too weird. they got sent back sadly.
3.0,Comfortable but roll down when I walk
3.0,"So I bought these in my normal size (XL) and they were great at that time. After a few wears, they seem to be stretching, they are now saggy and too big. If I order again, it will be in a size down. Material is soft and breathable though and you can't beat the price."
3.0,There is really nothing wrong with these glasses . They are well made. They are just to large for my face. I chose to keep them however to keep at my bedside for evening reading
3.0,Really hard to see over as they are so big! First time I have ever twisted the ear straps to shorten the heights but then they didn’t seal real well at the side.
3.0,"This chain was actually perfect before I started having health issues and not I can't wear it but I will suggest ordering nothing under a 16&#34;, because it does give you some room to &#34;grow&#34; - unless the necklace is for a young teenager and is petite"
3.0,"Returned as I didn't like the interior of the fabric.  It was like the inside was unfinished. They should use a higher quality material or line the item.  The color was very nice. The return process was easy, but expensive."
3.0,"I haven't gotten to wear mine as of yet. I just read a review that told me how to put it in, im hoping it works as I wanna wear it."
3.0,I believe after the first wash it will shrink.
3.0,"I got a medium. I am 5 6 and about 120 pounds. It may be a tad big on me...but it still fits well! When i originally bought it, i didn't notice the polka dots in the pattern, but they are there. still like the suit and plan to wear it!"
3.0,"I could not get them to fit....Period.  I just gave them to a friend with smaller arms.  Disappointed.....I measured my arms they were in between large and medium, I got the medium.  Should have bought the large.  Oh well....I guess my friend will enjoy them, nothing wrong with them, just would not fit."
3.0,Size up from the  size you estimate from their measurement page.  This dress is not busty girl friendly.
3.0,"POOR QUALITY, pom pom on hat is sad looking and frayed, scarf is will not hold up for a winter, too short for a 2-4year old, best thing about this set is just the mittens"
3.0,Ehhh they’re okay - but very tight and do not stay up well.
3.0,"This run small. I'm a size 8 US and I ordered the 8-8.5 size and they are the same /exact/ size as my foot. So, while they fit, I would have liked a few extra inches of space for comfort. It also states that the soles are memory foam but it just feels like the fur is glued to the bottom pad. They're alright but not what I was hoping for"
3.0,The coat was too small for me so I had to return it.
3.0,The skirt is beautiful and fits fine except when you sit down. The zipper busted and now I have to get that repaired. The zipper is very weak. It broke while I was having a pee.
3.0,They are not rip stop … rather more of a lightweight  “tent” material.<br />Whatever size you think you wear - go up 2 … as there are apparently “sized” for a troll<br /><br />I normally wear a 32x32 … wear a medium in boxers & shorts. I ordered a medium in these & the were more like a super small
3.0,They are good quality and a good product but I found them to be really big for the keychains I have. Also struggled trying to get the photos in.
3.0,"Fits smaller than stated. Twist does not wear well, stays open at bottom more than shows."
3.0,"The hat itself is fine.  It is a felt material. However, it arrived squished and is therefore wrinkly and hard to get back into shape. It worked OK as a one day prop."
3.0,not true to size runs small
3.0,got for my mother... was much smaller than i expected.  i went ahead and gave it to her.  not sure if she'll ever use it due to the size.
3.0,"It was a pretty dress, I'm a busty 8-10. I could not close the wrap."
3.0,I'm a size 8-10 in dresses and have large hips (size 10- 12 in dress pants) and also 5'8&#34; tall. These pants work well for the dance performance I need them for but I wish they were a bit more loose on my hips and thighs. The length is okay but it would be nice if they were a few inches longer. Overwall happy- since I'll be wearing them for a dance costume and not much else. They are super slowly and fun.
3.0,shipping was fast and size was as expected. But cloth quality is not that great. Its ok ok not too great.
3.0,"Got them for my son to use on the deck of the gym pool, and they work for that. However, if he wears them too long,  he says they hurt the back of his ankle.<br /><br />The plastic clips connecting the ends of the elastic laces fell off of both shoes after the third wearing."
3.0,Bought an 11 a size up and it’s still too small lovely design and spin just too small
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but the material is too body hugging and clingy. The material is soft and comfortable and the color is exactly as pictured, but if you are curvier or have larger hips, it hugs every single inch of that area. I am 5'6, 170, and I bought a large. An XL might have fit better, but I am guessing the clingy material would still have fit funny."
3.0,Looks different than the picture.  It’s ok but not what I was expecting.
3.0,I love this dress but it’s extremely hard to walk in. Just have to take baby steps!
3.0,very thin no padding  very cheap  as i said you get what you pay for.  (size also runs very small)
3.0,"I bought the green “292” color, and be warned that it is sheer. From most of the pictures this item appeared to be made from a more opaque fabric, but it is not. It also does not have a waist tie (and there are no loops were a waist tie would go if it just wasn’t in the package for some reason) and it does not have any type of closure. It is pretty, and the design/pattern itself matches what is shown in the pictures."
3.0,I like the lightweight coat but the ties on the side get caught on things dangerous
3.0,"It looked pretty on the picture, but when I received it, the actual size is way much bigger than the picture and my expectation. It looked weird to hang on the ear. I was to order it for my friend's Christmas gift, now I have to look for somethingelse for her. I probably will change it to pendant for the necklace."
3.0,The style was great. I really liked it. But the size was huge.  I am ojay with loose fitting clothes but this was not even flattering.  I returned it. I wish they would get thw sizing correct.
3.0,The big black stone fell out when I opened the package but I super glued it back down and it's beautiful I love it so much.
3.0,Ithis was a bit too large for me. But the glare filter and polarization is very good.
3.0,The colors were a little too dark. Didn’t blend well with my other Crimson Tide gear
3.0,"Beautiful design! loved the colors but it looks poor quality, I wasn't 100 % sure so I returned it."
3.0,OK sweaters but collar doesn't drape quite right
3.0,Bought this dress late last year and loved it. Bought  two more in different colors same size. All three fit differently.
3.0,"The big diamond sticks up a little too high. I wish the big diamond maybe a little smaller and the side diamonds a little bigger.  But, its a pretty ring. I wore it while mine was getting resized."
3.0,"Came as it is advertised, but size is small"
3.0,Very stiff and bulky.
3.0,"Material is different than previous workout pants I’ve owned. Fit isn’t perfect around calf’s/ankles, whichever style you get. However it does fit normal everywhere else. Previous reviews say the same thing. I enjoy the pockets on both sides.<br /><br />Update: I ran with these yesterday and today with using phone in my pocket. I have an iPhone 7. It kept pulling my pants down. Otherwise it works fine without using the pocket for phone use."
3.0,One eyelet came out immediately  but otherwise the shoe was very comfortable
3.0,"Color looks to be black and red on page but id actually dark blue and orange. Not overly happy with this putchase, will definitely be going to the mall to get what I need."
3.0,"Love it! Get compliments on it all the time, however after about 1 month it rusted and lost the silver color, turning brown."
3.0,Cute but digs into nipples
3.0,"Fits a bit small in bust area and the material isn't all its cracked up to be. However, for the price, it is as expected and got the job done."
3.0,Item was small and arrived very wrinkled. I won’t buy it again.
3.0,good enough but the material is in the cheap side and has a mild shine to it
3.0,"Overall, this purse will suit my needs. Good size and I like the outside pockets. I had planned to put my iPhone 8+ in one pocket. It is just barely large enough and I have to be very careful not to scratch it with the zipper. If arrived pretty flattened and I’ve had some difficulty softening it. Nice and roomy inside. I hope to get a lot of use given the price."
3.0,The shirt is pretty but runs a bit tight and material too thin
3.0,Very cute but very disappointed in the type of string they put the beads on. I feel like it will break as soon as I get used to wearing it
3.0,"Decent pair. However, lasted only one night before stretching too much to wear again."
3.0,"It was cute, but I took out the elastic!"
3.0,"Delivered sooner than expected so that was the best part.  The feather was alllll messed up and so I had to detach it from the bird.  For the price I won't be sending it back or anything like that. This is not for everyday use, it will tarnish."
3.0,"Orange, not red. But still cute"
3.0,I love the style of this dress.  I am a plus size girl who wears an 18/20 and even ordering the biggest size they have it to snug.  and the materiel does not give its very stiff.
3.0,Very see through. I would only be able to wear it as a coverup. Not worth it for the money
3.0,"I have fiber and fiber chemical ""finishing rinse"" sensitivities and purposefully shop for high cotton content. The tag inside this dress (burgundy) says 65% polyester - 30% cotton - 5% spandex. If this matters to you - BEWARE.<br />Otherwise I ordered a medium and I am a very slim 4 (CK jeans 4). Dress is not roomy at all as stated by many buyers; but quite flattering. The color is gorgeous and the quality of construction is quite good; stripes at sides match up well! Fabric is somewhat sheer and in sunny Phx, I'll be wearing a half slip.<br />Very disappointed in fiber content misinformation - will review again if it doesn't wash well or causes rash."
3.0,The top fit perfectly but the bottom is not quite A line. It was straighter than I was expecting and clings to your skin.
3.0,"Past experiences with dresses have been I get it too small so this time I opted to go larger, and as luck will have it it's too big! I need to accessorize it with a belt around my waist. I wear accessories that takes away from the chest fitting a little loose ie necklace with lots of strands! trendy accessories and foot wear makes it easy to pull if off. If I had to order again 12-14 I WOULD ! still no guarantees because then the waist would probably be in the wrong place! IJS"
3.0,"pretty decent for the price. Unfortunately , it did not last long with me. One of the handles snapped off from the frame a few days ago. I mean snapped off including the tiny screw."
3.0,Like these earrings!
3.0,"Fits a little small, arms are super tight. Otherwise good set of pj’s. Our 3yo is wearing the 4-5 and it’s snug."
3.0,"It is getting harder to find WAC gear, so I was happy to find this.  I already had a similar hat from another site but this was a bit cheaper.<br /><br />And now I know why.  Must be the old Army in me, but it was annoying the embroidery (Pallas Athena and writing) was not centered on the front of the cap.  It was low and off to one side.<br /><br />I gave it three stars for having it available but don't think I would buy again from here.  ( I didn't post a picture because I gave it away to someone that didn't mind it being askew)"
3.0,"I used to love all the Gloria Vanderbilt jeans! My closet is full of them but they are different now and not for the better! They used to be 98% cotton and 2% Spandex. They would fit like a glove and no matter what size I was, they were true to size. Now, they have added polyester to many of their jeans-up to 24% in some of them! With polyester, they are heavier and no longer fit as well, nor are they as comfortable.<br /><br />I would rather pay more for the jeans, capri's and skimmers with the former 98% cotton and 2% Spandex; in order to have the same prior beautiful fit.<br /><br />Buyer beware!"
3.0,Too small and paper thin. Would like more if they were thicker
3.0,Cute but see through. I would need to wear a dress under this dress to cover my bra and underwear. Returned
3.0,They are nice BUT the difference between them in colors aren't that noticeable other than that they nice
3.0,I got my normal size medium in these and they were loose like a large. There is absolutely no tummy control whatsoever about these leggings and zero butt lifting capabilities. These are simply a pair of fleece lined leggings for the winter.
3.0,"It's a cheap plastic watch.  It has a misprint on the face - it should say 22 under the 10, instead it says 20.  It works OK so far and since I'm gonna end up being pretty rough on it, it's fine.  Would be a great 1st watch for a kid as the face is pretty small and it's relatively inexpensive."
3.0,Beautifully made but too large.  Too soon to have an opinion on durability.
3.0,They are for wide heels
3.0,"They are lightweight plastic with binder hoops. They are cute, but I haven't worn my crocs with them on yet. I hope they last."
3.0,The c ring the ship was attached to opened and the entire charm fell off the bracket.  It was fixable but very disappointing since it was a gift.
3.0,Color was not as nice as pictured.  Didn't look black. It looked more like a faded black or very dark gray.
3.0,they run small!
3.0,This dress fits a little small...wish i went a size up
3.0,Pretty sweet ring.  I got shipped a size larger than I ordered so I just wear it on a different finger that originally planned.  It helps that it's also my initials.
3.0,"Shirt looks great.  I originally ordered a large and saw where many recommended ordering a size up so this was my second order.<br />I was so shocked when I opened the shirts packaging and wow dirty the shirt was!  It had hairs, dust balls and torn up paper.  I am guessing the shirt fell on the floor at the wearhouse when it was being prepared for shipping.<br />I will not be trying this shirt on for size until after I wash it!  Then at that point I will have two shirts."
3.0,"Ordered XXL and I got XXL but no way I could squeeze into this, maybe a 4xl would work but I gave this one to my 15 year old. Definitely by big...way big!"
3.0,Way too small. Not American sizing
3.0,The shades were not straight
3.0,Less than two months old and the strap broke - epic fail<br />Otherwise good bag
3.0,Overall not bad. It does run small so account for that. Also not very thick. Granddaughter was happy with it.
3.0,I like it.  It's just a tiny bit too small.
3.0,too short cannot use it.  not recommended
3.0,Ordered a 2XL and it fits like a medium.
3.0,"Beautiful bra. Well made. I wish I could keep it. I ordered, and received, a 38 E. In bras, I wear a 36 DDD or 38 DD. I overflowed the bra and completely collapsed the structure. My husband nearly hurt himself laughing. If you have large, heavy breasts, don't bother buying this - there is no way this bra will support you. If you are smaller, this is a good bra for you. I wish I could keep it ...."
3.0,The set is nice but sizing is off. It's supposed to fit 4 thru 10 year olds.  My granddaughter is 8 and it's way too big.  More like adult size.
3.0,"Fits great everywhere, except for the fact they sit so low on the waist. Maybe good for some, but not me."
3.0,"These glasses look really sweet, but as far as functionality, the price reflects it."
3.0,The mountain metal is a lot bigger than I pictured .  Overall I like it and I’m going to keep it But it is much bigger
3.0,"This is cute, dainty, but had enough presence that it is worth wearing. I feel the price is a bit too steep for the item since it is only stainless steel."
3.0,Cute top but runs a little bit small
3.0,"I didn't like how the collar was draw string, but that was my bad because I didn't do my research. If you're like me and have big breasts but are small everywhere else I would order a size smaller than you normally would! It's super cute though and I rocked it!!"
3.0,The description says sweatshirt. It is like a very light t-shirt. Definitely not a sweatshirt. Run small should buy at least two sizes bigger. Very disappointed pretty design though.
3.0,Lasted until couldn't be returned and then one of the back straps on the right pulled out of the sole. Unusable now.
3.0,"My kids gave me a pair of these bags 3 years ago.  They were wonderful! The flat bottoms make them very easy to load at the store, they do not fold in on themselves!  After 3 years of use, and a bagger that wasn't paying attention and ripped the bag, I decided to replace them.  This second pair, looked identical, except when trying to use the zippers.  The zippers on the new bags simply do not want to work right, very frustrating.  One of the features I liked so much was that they zipped closed, these zippers are so difficult I find myself giving up on zipping them closed, which does not make them as rigid as if the zipper worked properly.  If you get some that the zippers work right, I would rate them 5 star, and recommend the purchase, but if the zippers are hit and miss, it is much harder to recommend them."
3.0,holes were too big. otherwise cute
3.0,"It would be nice if it had a pocket on the front, as most men like it that way. They sweater does fit kind of small just as it states, so consider a larger size if you want extra room."
3.0,Cool design but didn't exactly look like pic looks a little cheaply made
3.0,"The sizing chart is off. Judging by it I should be a medium. But I ordered large figuring this was the case. It fits nicely, the pockets are fake on the jacket though. Although that’s what one should expect. The tailoring on the tie is all sorts of messed up. It’s got a weird fold in the point towards the bottom but it is costume after all. The pants are made with a stretchy spandex like material and don’t have any belt loops or anything like that. Though they do fit nicely I was also wearing another pair of pants under them."
3.0,I ordered an 8 (usually 7.5/8) and it was a little too big. I ordered the 7.5 before returning the 8 to see how it fit. I couldn't get my foot into the 7.5 because of a high foot. It was surprising since there isn't too much difference between the two. My coworker commented that my feet looked very large in these shoes.
3.0,"The slippers are definitely cute and great for hardwood floors however, the shoe is too shallow so they kept slipping off the back of my son's heels. I wish I could tie the strings on the shoe to make it fit tighter."
3.0,"It is not soft. I knew it was a woman's fit, but it is still smaller than I expected."
3.0,For a cheap pair of earrings these are not that bad. I actually would have given 5 stars if it did not come out of the package with one of the earrings already broken.
3.0,"Okay quality. But the sizing is a joke. Ordered XXL , fits more like a M/L. Shorter than expected also. I ordered big because I like my clothing to fit a little bigger. Was so excited to wear this “long tee” with leggings on my honey moon. Definitely WON’T be wearing this with leggings."
3.0,By his bag is very pretty but much flimsier than I expected overall nice though
3.0,The fit is good but it is too itchy. It irritated my son skin when he tried it on
3.0,"These gloves fit well and have super cute styling.  Unfortunately they just don't look like leather, which for the price is probably to be expected.  Oh well.  In the end, they probably look too cheap for me to wear."
3.0,Much thinner and more sparkly than anticipated. My fault for not reading more carefully! Quality yet to be determined.
3.0,"Pretty ring, however, the band does not match the engagement ring. Stones are notably smaller in the band. The images do not match the actual product received as the band in the images reflects stones in the band matching the size of the stone in the engagement ring, which does not.<br />For the price, a nice ring, however, I would not recommend as an actual wedding set due to quality and inconsistency of band and engagement ring stones"
3.0,This didn't work for me because the placement of the pockets is unflattering on me. It makes me look wider in the tummy/hip area. The garment itself is well made and the fabric seems like good quality.
3.0,The wig is a nice length but is small on my head and tracks are showing
3.0,"I bought this so I could breathe...unfortunately it was so scratchy and irritating I could not use it.  It was also too big and slid all over my face so I was constantly pulling it up.  It's in a drawer now with the rest of the muzzles I was forced to wear to appease an ignorant governor with more flab on his belly than brains in his head.  Personally I do not like blingy sparkling clothing items and I would have liked this more if it were made out of a non-shiny gunmetal type of mesh, but otherwise, it was okay, and the best feature, BREATHABILITY, so nice."
3.0,The xl version of this shirt is a large.
3.0,"A bit tight around the toes, but well made and keeps its shape."
3.0,The purse is very narrow & doesn have any outside pockets except where you put your gun. I had to order a purse organizer for the inside due to the lack of pockets.
3.0,Seemed cheap to me but my Grandaughter likes it
3.0,Parts of the shoe had fallen off and not a good picture of a bunny. Looks like a mouse.
3.0,"This is a good bag for a purse, not a laptop bag. It would fit a tablet only. But the material is sturdy and it’s cute."
3.0,It's too long.
3.0,I bought these for my two kids 3 and 6. They are a little big for her and fit just right for my petite 6 year old.
3.0,"I was disappointed.  The shirt fit a little snug.  The material doesn't breathe at all, therefore a hot-natured person is going to be miserable.  The colors are what I saw on the picture so that's good."
3.0,shouldn't have cost what it did for its size
3.0,Removing two stars! These earrings turned green/black.<br />Beautiful earring. I use it on my daith piercing. I had my friend put it in. It is small and a bit tricky to get in the piercing without losing a ball.  Lol. My friend put the earring in and then added one ball at a time.  I ordered a second one for my other daith piercing.
3.0,The little hairs on my wrist were pulled when I tried this on.
3.0,Alot shorter then picture. Not happy with it.
3.0,"Not all of the bands are perfectly bonded, so the first I wore came apart at the seams after an hour on trail ( I use them for whistles with a trail running group).<br /><br />The others look better, but we'll see."
3.0,"This larger scale wallet is really adorable, but if you're someone who tends to carry more than three or four credit/gift cards at one time along with cash, you'll find that the wallet won't remain closed.  I have several credit and gift cards which I typically carry on a daily basis along with a small sum of cash.  However, after repeated attempts at re-arranging the cards inside of the wallet it still would pop open.  So, I feel it would be okay for a young lady who's not going to be carrying around too much in the way of cash and/or cards and just wants a cute clutch bag for her purse or to carry around as is."
3.0,I can’t close the clasp on them. Other than that it would have been a great product
3.0,The dress is cute and I purchased a small. However it is a little too loose on me and kinda a baggy fit. Otherwise it seems to be of good quality and the color as expected. It might look good on tall build - it maybe because the baggy fit was not faltering on me. I am short and petite build.
3.0,I wore this for the first time- after 4 hours- the zipper is getting stuck. It’s a shame cause it’s so cute and feels good. I did size up as recommended and that was needed
3.0,Fit is true to size and quality was better than expected. Colors were clear but design was a little more blurred than the picture shows.
3.0,"I got an XS but couldn't even get an idea how it'd fit because the dress was HUGE. I knew it said that XS was size 10, but I assumed it was UK size 10, not US (as US 10 is far from being an XS, you know). I wear size 2 and could almost wrap myself twice with it. The green is darker and less nice than in the picture, also arrived a bit dirty on the back."
3.0,"it didn't cost much but, a little disappointed on how &#34;cheap&#34; it seemed."
3.0,We ordered a size 14 but they fit more like a size 13
3.0,"The dress doesn’t have much of a shape to it, feels like a moo moo in a way. Also I’m 5’9” and the dress wasn’t the length I was hoping. It comes about 3.5 inches from the floor."
3.0,"The product itself is fine on its own, I got a 3xl, which is a size bigger than what I usually get and it’s still somewhat tight. Not only that the company sent me a USED one. I know this because cause the tag on the back of the pants was cut before I got it."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Perfect size for young girl. Cute item for price paid.
3.0,"I love this seller because no one else on the market has the variety and the quality of the fabrics. This seller doesn't cheap out on the lining fabrics either. However, the cuts of the dresses are a total hit or miss. Out of a total of 10 different dresses that I got only 2 had ever fit me.<br />I ordered the green velvet dress with embroidery in size 6 because it was the smallest available. I tried to order size 4, but my order got cancelled.<br />About the dress - I ordered size 6 because of the shoulders: 14.5"". Technically, I need 15"", but 14.5"" totally works in soft fabrics. I figured I can take dress in at the waist. (I have a sewing machine and not afraid to use it, lol!) What I got is not what is listed. The dress in size 6 has 14"" shoulders with a<br />34"" waist. That's a bit much and definitely has to do with quality control and false advertisement. This is not how the model is shapped. Plus size should be sold as plus size!<br />The dress is retro beautiful and I might still putz around with it and try to take in. I am 15"" at the shoulders, 34"" in cheast, 27"" at the waist and 36"" at the hips. My waist is under average, so taking out 6"" of fabric might not be the smartest thing... Most likely, I will have to return the dress. Needless to say, I am very disappointed."
3.0,"I was so excited for this dress but then it  really disappointed me. The fabric was made out of that, stretchy, slightly transparent fabric. It fit me pretty okay bit the arms were way too tight. Plus the button at the collar was nearly impossible to button."
3.0,It fits okay but there is no elastic around seems and it falls doesn’t stay up . Material is faded I wanted to like it it does run big but it seemed half sewn together
3.0,I’m 5’4 and these hit mid calf. Based on the photo I was expecting them to be longer :(
3.0,scratchy
3.0,It is cheap but a little too large for me
3.0,"Not that I expected these to fit like normal shorts, but they were a little too weird for me. I have a very average size and shape body, but I just couldn’t get into these. Comfortable though! But too weird to wear in public for my taste… they just lay weird."
3.0,It is ok but the inside color is yellow and the salmon or white would be a better choice to go with the rose box..It isn't as pink as I thought it would be more of a salmon color..Its ok
3.0,Hard to put on and take off.
3.0,Stripes on sleeve didn't line up with torso part
3.0,Looks good and my wife loved it but I was disappointed to find it in some knock off box. The description said it was by VW so I was willing to pay the $10 dollars. Had I known it was a knock off I might have gone with another.
3.0,"The color is beautiful, runs a little small. The fabric wasn’t what I had expected."
3.0,It is a lovely piece.  Does not run true to size.
3.0,One of the prongs fell out on the second day of wearing. Returning.
3.0,"The necklace itself is very nice, but it has a horrible odor that just will not go away.  I've tried spraying it with Lysol disinfectant spray and the odor still persists after trying to air it out for weeks."
3.0,Smaller than other garments and the fabric is less than quality weight.  A bit see through.
3.0,"Like what they sell but my necklace isn’t like the picture. The necklace is sturdy but I don’t to much care for the material on my neck , and with the knots to adjust the length so have to keep mines long."
3.0,"The quality if the trousers is polyester which i didn’t like as it didn’t feel comfortable to put on my baby. Highly dissappointed, ordered this as a going home outfit for my baby but didn’t end up using it even once"
3.0,"These gloves seem to have been designed without the liner, and the liner was added as an afterthought, they are tight, I have small hands, but they are almost too tight to wear, I will end up stretching them to see if they fit better, theyre well made, and warm, although I question if it is really lambswool, as it is a bit itchy, I do love them and hope that the stretching works, they DEFINATELY work as texting gloves, I don't have any problems using my phone while wear them, which is a relief in the NW and commuting by public transit"
3.0,"I originally got these for my nose.  I had a heck of a time trying to get them in.  They are really short and a touch too big of a gauge for my nose.  As another reviewer said, they are better suited for a cartilage piercing.  Also note that both the ball and the &#34;diamond&#34; do unscrew.  So I will be using these for my ear.  So while not a complete bust they are not a complete five star either.  These stainless steel studs were provided to me for evaluation at a promotional rate and without any further obligation."
3.0,I knew it would be Big based on other reviews but this was HUGE on my daughter. I was only using for pictures so I was able to tuck in and around to make it look her size. Really cute though.
3.0,For very slim fit
3.0,It stains too easy and don’t come out ... looks like Greece stain but no matter what method used it looks ruined and sloppy
3.0,"I ordered Orange and received Gray. I had no time for a return or exchange as I had an upcoming trip and needed the luggage.  Otherwise, good product."
3.0,Good material.  Came in a timely manner.<br />It's more than i expected inly wish it would fit a bit better.
3.0,Pin fell out early had to be careful after that.
3.0,It’s nice it looks good . But it’s a little uncomfortable on the skin
3.0,Comfy. But polyester fabric just feels so plasticky to me.
3.0,looks good but i can't get it past my boobs
3.0,They aren’t the material you would expect. But I made them work! I actually like them a lot besides the waste band being so wide+squeezing my stomach all day. I wear them like once a week to work 🤷‍♀️
3.0,"nice, gives you a copper ring-around-the-finger if worn for too long"
3.0,Fits rather largely.
3.0,Love it love it material is going to love it
3.0,"Beautiful chain, but way too thin."
3.0,Disappointed in the weight of this sweater. Quality didn't seem to be that great for the price.
3.0,I have ordered other socks in 3x but this pair ran smaller.
3.0,"This is the second d product I’ve received from MISSJOY and unfortunately, the same issue I had with the yoga/bicycle shorts is the same issue I have with these Capri yoga pants. First of all, the pants have a good stretch to them and the fabric feels comfortable. However, the brand needs to seriously consider putting a drawstring in all their shorts and pants. Wow these fit in my butt and thighs, they are terribly too big in the waste and I just have an average size waist for someone my size. Every time I wear these and been down it shows my back side! If these had a drawstring that would prevent this issue from occurring and would allow you to tighten the pants at the waist. Please consider adding a drawstring! The pants are made of 80% nylon and 20% spandex and are made in China.  See my pictures for more details."
3.0,"Great Christmas gift for my son, however the metal begin to rust rather quickly. Would not purchase this item again."
3.0,"Ok. So if you aren't very very round in the bottom/hip area this is probably gonna be a magic skirt for you. It aaaaaaalmost is for me. The waist is perfect (per size chart, not typical size). The only issue for me is that across that lower tummy/bootie/hip area its a little tight. And not uncomfortably tight. Just a little unflatteringly tight. And its not awful.  I'm not returning it. I will just find a top a little longer than I had planned to wear with it. Maybe a sweater. It every other way it is exactly what I wanted! Very cute skirt to wear with my tights and boots!"
3.0,"The glasses are good, but the color isn't what the picture showed.  However, they are nice and came with great extras."
3.0,The fit was great the length was great the pockets were great. The not so great part was that the buttons are stitched on poorly and fall off then your left with pocket flaps flapping in the wind. Also the fabric is not as durable as I expected it to be on something labeled “ camping “
3.0,"The sizes and color fit great! But we were expecting brand new jackets, instead one of them was a used one when we paid for the price of brand new ones.  The used one had the name of the previous owner on it!"
3.0,"Movement is not precise, when you set the time and push in the crown, the hands move, tough to set the correct time this way.  The watch movement is not precise.  Band color is brown not orange as in the picture.  Overall, its a decent looking watch.  Let hope it works a year or two."
3.0,"Nice heavy socks, but the designs/logos on them are a bit odd..."
3.0,"I originally bought the maternity T-shirt’s (black, white and grey and white stripes) offered by this same company/brand. I loved them so much that I thought a dress would be just as nice. I ordered the light grey and white striped dress and blue dress. They’re not the same. The blue dress was a completely different material. Too thin and not as flattering on the body. It just kind of hangs. However the grey and white stripped dress was that same material as the T-shirt’s, which I liked. So I kept the grey and white and returned the blue. Another thing to note is the dress is about knee length and the sleeves are longer than the typical T-shirt. I’ll be hemming those to the length I prefer. Ok buy overall, but just be careful that not all the colors are the same material.<br /><br />UPDATE: I also ended up returning the stripped dress as well. The length and of the dress and sleeves were too much to hem. Not worth it."
3.0,"skimpy bodice stretches too tightly across bust (bought 3X, am 38DD). the skirt on the other hand. is generously wide and  way too long.<br />the  rayon/spandex knit fabric is nice and drapes well.<br />I like it enough to wear and keep,  but had to hem it and must hide the too-tight bustline with a topper.  would be great fit for a tall pear shape gal, but I am a 5'5&#34; upside-down pear."
3.0,"It's fine, I had low expectations since it was a $20 dress. It's comfy and will likely last for just one season. It is pretty poorly made and the armpit holes are giant but as I said, low expectation."
3.0,Husband liked the wallet but it took forever to arrive.
3.0,"Wife likes the shoes, but one is noticeably larger than the other."
3.0,"These underwear are super soft and very comfortable.  Unfortunately, they fit way too short, especially after a wash.  I'm 6'0"" and wear a 32 or 33 waist depending on how much i eat lol.  And these things were CLIMBING up you know where.  after a wash, forget it, it was like wearing briefs.  I need like 3-4 more inches on the legs to be comfortable to wear."
3.0,"I bought these for my husband. The frames are bigger then I expected. They feel like they are made with cheap material ,Which is fine because I just bought these for the lake. He just wanted a cheap pair. Over all I don't this we will buy again"
3.0,"Bought it for my dad who is 38, but still tight for me 33. Doesn't look like slacks. Feels and looks more like exercise pants. Package came from China so it took about three weeks to arrive. Length seems longer than 32."
3.0,"This is a nice nightgown in terms of appearance and feel, but it does run large."
3.0,"The bottoms are true to size but the cups on the top are extremely small. However, both top and bottom are made well and the bottoms are not see-through at all."
3.0,Bought my son’s normal size but can’t even get over his butt. Too small and too late to return. Bought early as a part of Easter basket.
3.0,Poor material....seam opened the first time that I wore
3.0,This nose ring is very cute and big. The only thing is that the tip of the nose ring is thick which it can be uncomfortable to put in when putting the nose ring in.
3.0,it is really nice but to small
3.0,they are a big fir for me but overall okay
3.0,Color is way more grey and less “marble” like
3.0,Dress was ok for the price. I use a lounge around the house dress
3.0,In my opinion the sunglasses are the same as some I’ve bought at Target & Kohl’s. I bought them at a sale price so I figured I couldn’t go wrong. I really don’t see much difference compared to my current inventory.
3.0,wouldn't necessarily say the &#34;best&#34; but they are alright. was a little irritated after the first use one of the shirt stays already broke the sewn in seam that keep the clips the same length. They also tend to not want to hold on very well even after being loosened completely.
3.0,The fabric and garment is nice.  I wanted this to fit a lot larger for more front drape. I ordered 2 sizes larger than one I ordered last month from a similar brand on Amazon.  This fit exactly the same as the large and I order a 2X so it seems to run small.
3.0,This was great for hawaii. But you must understand that the colors in the photo are nothing like what the dress actually looks like. It is dark primary colors and not bright tropical colors.
3.0,"Super cute and arrived quickly but the zipper ties started falling off a day after I got it. I do love the color and am impressed the amount of pockets for such a small purse, but it's quality isn't great."
3.0,"Bra area too small, barely covers my nipples"
3.0,"I have 2 other pair of 90 Degree yoga pants, that I purchased from TJ Maxx and I love them.  The ones I ordered from Amazon are made of a much thinner material.  The fit was smaller.  I was displeased with them overall so I sent them back."
3.0,really pretty but very snug and I usually wear a true Medium.  Heavy material for those who like warmth
3.0,This runs long! My two year old is y’all and it still runs a little long on her. Cute pattern! Great for summer in the south.
3.0,"I bought this bracelet for my Granddaughter to wear for her Kindergarten promotion.<br />The bracelet was very tight on her. (She is one of the smaller kids in her class) so her size wasn’t the problem, the bracelet size was too small."
3.0,"Not as large as is pictured, two different colored lace, and took 6 weeks to get to me. Never again!"
3.0,"Very cute, nice fabric but runs really big. I usually wear a Large or 12/14 so I bought the 14/16 and it's like a very loose dress - the higher parts come to my mid thigh ( I'm 5'3&#34;). The armholes are also large so I have to wear a tank top underneath to cover my side boob.  If it fit well, I would give it 5 stars. Will probably use it as a beach cover up. I'm kinda sad since I had to wait for a few weeks to get it."
3.0,Super cute. I'm am 8 1/2 and the shoe around my ankle is really big. I may have to try relacing them.
3.0,"They are okay, but not heavy duty like my original Montana sunglasses I had a couple years ago (and misplaced :() . The lenses are attached on the outside of the frame (as the picture shows). The body of the glasses are not as thick and does not have the solid feel that my old pair had.  With my history of sunglasses, they probably won't last long.  However, they look good and worked well for this summer."
3.0,I was looking for Kappougi when I wear kimono. But it was M size only and too small for me. I wish that you guys have bigger size from Japan.
3.0,"The lenses here feel fake. The overall product looks great, but I'm not sure if what I ordered was actually legitimate or not."
3.0,Lovely design and great fit...however the material makes it more of a casual dress. I purchased the blue for a somewhat formal occasion but the material just doesn't say formal...I was hoping for a little better as far as material is concerned. Great casual dress though.
3.0,"I received this product in two days prime shipping so that was a plus , but, I ordered xtra large and was sent a large which I’m very unhappy about- the sleeves on the picture model look scrunched up and I’m 5’2” with shorter arms and this is exactly cut to my wrists - this dress doesn’t have pockets which is fine But the neck line is much higher than the picture shows - lastly, the material is cotton, but it’s a hard dry cotton feeling very stiff. Not sure how it will turn out after a wash. Overall, for the price, it’s good."
3.0,the coral is lighter than shows
3.0,"Fast shipping with Vibrant colors and decent fit,  I just was expecting a better material. It's a cheap synthetic material and I was hoping for a more spandex material. I'm 5'10 and ordered a large."
3.0,"The item is very loose on my door and the clips slide out of place when a little weight is placed on them. If I can get it to stay in place, it will be an adequate hanger for my tote bags. For the price, it is a good deal. I may keep the long strap and add my own clips- made of stainless steel. The plastic ones slide too much."
3.0,Shows a LOT of sideboob on me.
3.0,"I bought this dress thinking it'd be long and flowy on my 5'3&#34; frame. It's flowy but shorter than I expected, and somewhat snug in the bust. That being said, it'll be a good swimsuit coverup."
3.0,not hypoallergenic
3.0,Decent for what I needed them for but one was really loose and the top dropped to the carpet to be gone forever.
3.0,Fit was goofy.
3.0,"Loved this boot, super soft! This is not a true to size boot. It is cut very narrow, should be a narrow width & runs a size smaller. Very disappointed."
3.0,Online the colour did come off alot different was kinda disappointed and the bag had a dent otherwise i love the bag get alot of compliments
3.0,It beautiful the color is great
3.0,I really like the storage space this offers me. The only complaint I have is that one of the two hangers broke minutes after I hung it up
3.0,Doesn’t glow like I thought it would.
3.0,"I love the look of this watch. I can read it easily. But... if I'm not wearing it it seams to loose time. I'm also thinking that the band will not last long. It makes a fun fashion statement ,but not good for daily wear."
3.0,Really see-through and the fabric feels rather cheap.
3.0,Charms came off easily. Was a little big also.
3.0,"This product was decent quality but was much more clingy than I expected.  I was looking for something that was comfortable and hung nicely, but this seemed to be more spandex than polyester."
3.0,"Very nice color when I first got it. Note that when I washed it, some dark colors bled into it, and it absorbed a kind of a gray cast, so it's not as vibant as before. Nevertheless, it's very stylish. It's more for fall than winter weather, however."
3.0,"Gorgeous bracelet. I received so many compliments! I just wish it would've been made a little sturdier. After wearing the bracelet quite a few times over a 5 month period, one of the starfish arms cracked and broke off. Be gentle with this for longer use!"
3.0,I have a medium foot and these fall off. Too wide
3.0,This hat is not quite one size fits all.
3.0,"I love the print, how light it is, my only problem is the print is peeling off one of the two buckle straps. I hope this doesn't transfer to the rest of the watch. Otherwise it's a good strap for my S3 Gear, so will see how it fairs with everyday wear."
3.0,Fun and cute. Wore them to Coachella
3.0,"hard to get on because of the straps.  Size is labeled as XLarge.  fits, but I normally wear 8-10"
3.0,I was a little disappointed.  This was supposed to be a gift for a great friend.  It seemed cheaply made and not at all as pretty as the picture.
3.0,They don’t look exactly like as pictured.
3.0,"I bought my husband a pair of Clics maybe five years ago and he loved them. When the frame broke this past year he was eager for me to replace them. Sadly, the Clic website did not offer his correction which is 2.25; so I turned to Amazon. While Amazon offered lenses with the right correction, I must have bought him a long frame last time because the distance from the back to the front of these glasses is shorter than in the original pair he still has. The result is that he doesn't like them as well because they are too tight and, therefore, a bit uncomfortable. As I did not see a way to order a bigger sized frame on Amazon or the right correction on the manufacturer's website in a bigger frame, this has turned into somewhat of a no win situation for my husband. Definitely, if you have a big head, get a long or extra large frame."
3.0,"The tankini fits nicely over the midriff, flowy without being too &#34;blousy&#34;.  IT is designed to not cling to the body.  The padding in the cups cannot be removed which is a problem for me since I don't need the extra bulk.  it will work out ok."
3.0,Bought this for my LV bag and it’s lighter than I wanted
3.0,A little loose and long in the front crotch area  Tried altering them and didn’t work
3.0,"not got quality, not good covering, wire at nose uncomfortable"
3.0,"Very cute. Large enough for my things, but not too big. I'm giving it 3 stars because like some other reviews, the piece that holds the shoulder strap on broke after 1 use. I just sewed it back on with invisible thread & seems to be holding up well. Quality could be better, but it's a cute purse."
3.0,They're super cute and comfortable but I am constantly adjusting the straps so that they stay on my feet.
3.0,Purchased this in 2019 for about $50. No way would i pay $149 for it now. Yes it’s a beautiful ring and it lasts but stones get super cloudy. You have to deep clean it daily in order to keep some of the shine to it. When I purchased this there were only 26 reviews on it. Here we are 3 years later with only 54 reviews on it and triple the price. Says a lot. No thank you.
3.0,Glasses won't come off but the cord is too stiff for me. It sticks straight out and pushes against shirt collar. O.K. if there is no collar.
3.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend and they were too small. They fit my 7yr old great. I would not say these are for men as the frames are more narrow and the nose part is narrow. Other than that, pretty good value for the price. Came with a little protective pouch that can be used to clean the lenses."
3.0,This top runs small I brought an Xl  and it was tight
3.0,I like it but it's just a little tight at the crotch
3.0,Cute print but was too short for my taste. I also have wide hips so this fit was not flattering on me.
3.0,The coat too rinkle
3.0,Quality material with a good finish to the knit.  Seems small.  I ordered a large for my aunt but it fits me as a size medium. That won't bode well for an over layer so I will be looking to return or gift to someone else.  Sleeves are a bit short and the fit is snug.  Love the dark purple color!
3.0,"Usually a size 10 , but the large, it was skin tight! Nice fabric and print, but runs much smaller than size chart. The sides go up pretty high. When arms are down my fingertips went lower than the slit."
3.0,"I ordered these earrings. They are pretty much as shown in the product description. however they are tiny. The product description did give the size in mm, which I converted to inches before I placed the order, but I was still very surprised at how small they are.. My fault, but be careful when ordering Jewelry online."
3.0,"I just finished swimming in my new tail! It was awful. My feet wouldn't stay in the monofin. The strap covers both ankles, so when I point my feet to look more like a mermaid, the strap slides off my heels. Then I'm just kinda flopping around with my fin following behind me. I even tried tightening the monofin, but all it did was mash my toes into the end and STILL slip off of my ankles! But it looks beautiful: the ankle area isn't big or clunky, it isn't see-through (which was very important to me), and the heels weren't too visible. But there's no use in buying a swimmable tail if you can't swim in it!"
3.0,"I ordered a size up, but it was still too tight.  The material was also flimsier than I expected.  Having to return it."
3.0,"It's a pretty dress, nice pattern, decent material, flowy as I hoped.  The waist and length fit perfectly (extra small, I'm 5'1 and 105 lbs) HOWEVER the top is super fabric heavy. It doesn't fit my bust correctly at all. I'm keeping the dress but I have to get it altered,  it looks almost matronly.<br /><br />Edit: I might actually return it. I found some other dresses that would be appropriate for the occasion as well that won't require the effort and money of alterations. I wish it was worth it. :("
3.0,"They block the light well, but compared to other reading glasses I have, they did not focus well."
3.0,Color is a bit off from photo. Great fit.
3.0,Very pretty but not sturdy. May be able to squeeze a couple uses in with extra care. Feathers attached to cardboard so wings not flexible and easily permanently bent. Made it through the party intact though. Served it’s purpose but not for multi use.
3.0,"For the price, it's hard to find things to knock on this purchase. Especially with name brand alternatives costing as much as they do, this was acceptable. Definitely tighter than I anticipated, and thinner in the fabric than I was expecting. I'm 6'2&#34; and 200 pounds (size 32 waist) and an XL was a struggle to get on and off, but wasnt uncomfortabl while on. Also, you'd think that this was sent via pack mule. I mean, good god. This literally took almost a month to recieve. Thank God I wasn't ordering insulin from these guys."
3.0,"Cute & good quality. It was short on my body (if I raised my arms all the way up, I was gambling with a boob slip). I've never had this issue before so I'd say if you don't have a shorter torse, you might want to avoid it."
3.0,"Zip keeps getting stuck, otherwise a good boot"
3.0,Mmm idk I love the lanyard part but the key part didn’t fit :/
3.0,Looks baggy
3.0,"This watch is kinda small , it looks it can fit a woman’s wrist .. not so much for a man’s. I bought this for my bf and it was pretty tiny . Not bad but small ."
3.0,Would have been beautiful if the earrings had gotten here in one piece. One side was totally detached from the hook.<br />I love them and I try to hook them securely when I wear them so I don't lose them.
3.0,"im usually a 2x i sized down just like the reviews said however, i shouldve gotten an xl i bought a 1x  runs big ..material is light which is good ,,i read other reviews where they said front is long but they stated they were a lot shorter than i am ...i'm 5'6 too long in the front but ill make it work i kept iti ...i shouldve returned it but im going away soon n dont have sufficient time so yea :/"
3.0,My husband loved this set but it was missing the mustache options it showed it came with.
3.0,Nice snow suit .
3.0,"I really like these pants, but there were threads coming out in different places straight out from the package...it’s cute and comfy, but the quality is not very well made"
3.0,"Soft and warm. The fit is accurate and the color is as expected. It’s just not that flattering. I like it but I was expecting it to be cuter. FYI, I ordered XL in caramel. I typically wear 16/18 and the fit is fine, arms are a little long but not a big deal, I cuffed them. My husband said I look like Fozzy Bear. Not the look I intended. I did wash it and it washed well, warm cycle and low heat the dryer. It came out fine, no damage or color bleeding."
3.0,"Like the adjustable rings that I have purchased before.  This one pinches my finger if I loosen it, it won't stay on."
3.0,I have child- sized wrist and this band was still to tight for me. I had to get it wet and leave it in an extended position for 2 days to get it to stretch where it was just comfortable enough to wear. After about a week it has 2 long snags in it. I’m not particularly rough with it so it must snag easily.
3.0,A lot larger than expected. I'm larger breasted and this top made me look pregnant. Didn't work for me but it was cute
3.0,"Not bad, it just OK."
3.0,"Very soft material that is not too thin and the colors are so sweet. However, as mentioned in another review and pictured in the item listing, the brand label is sewn on to the front and the tag is OUTSIDE the shirt. They were a gift and I used them, but I wouldn't order them again because of the tags. They run wider than some American brands like Carters. They fit more like Gap/Old Navy."
3.0,"All the enamel earrings are extremely heavy, you can see them pulling my earlobe and hole. My ears have never hurt as badly as they hurt from all the enamel earrings from this company. I wore them around the house to get my ears used to them, but there was no chance. I ended up going with a different jewelry look for my friends wedding.<br />However, all of these earrings are beyond gorgeous! I wish they were significantly lighter, and that’s coming from someone who isn’t sensitive to fake jewelry and can easily wear heavier earrings.<br />So sad none of my enamel purchases worked out 😭"
3.0,"These earrings were a lot larger than I thought they'd be, though I suppose that's somewhat my fault for not reading the description more closely. Also, they are quite loud/jangly when I move. A bit distracting."
3.0,This dress is see through. Comfy at first wear but once washed it shrunk.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughters birthday. It is not as nice as the picture. The outfit is ok, but the picture is printed on blurry."
3.0,"It was very pretty and shiny, but it was hard to see the detail because of the very small size"
3.0,"Nice material but not what I was hoping for. Was looking for a compression tank for under my work clothes, material is soft and breathable but they don’t stay tucked. I bought a medium (5’8 165lb) and they slide up to my belly button when I bend over. I’ll try them for running but definitely won’t wear them for work again."
3.0,"I received the shorts and was pleasantly surprised at the fitment and padding in the liner.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I did have one issue and discovered the zipper malfunctioned leaving the door open.  I had to wrestle with the zipper, eventually got it down, then zipped back up.  I will try using them once more, if it does it again, I will return for a replacement.  Other than that, they look and fit great."
3.0,Arrived broken and they were flimsy. Too easy to bend.
3.0,It was pretty but had to be glued back on the piece in less than a week
3.0,Clips were as expected.
3.0,"Super cute shoes but within the 6 hours we’ve had them, the front of the shoes is already messed up. The glitter has come off the row of the shoes and is just solid white. Makes them look like we’ve had them for a long time already."
3.0,This dress did not look cute on me. I could tell before I even tied it up that it wasn’t a good fit. The sleeves were too fluffy and it honestly looked like I was wearing a robe. Maybe if it came in an extra small?! I’m 5’2” and 110 lbs.
3.0,"You get a good few earrings for your money, which is great if you're prone to losing them like I am, however, the uniformity of each earring leaves a little to be desired. Some are much tighter than others, and the earrings are slightly rough to the touch."
3.0,"I was expecting to get a decal to put on the window of my car but when I received it, it was very tiny. I had to go back on the site and the description does say 3 in so it is my fault for not reading better. It is a great decal with the original logo I wanted but it worked better for a computer sticker than a car one. I would order from this company again definitely."
3.0,Cute. Wire was a bit loose.
3.0,These are very small--order a size larger if you like them
3.0,Cuidar un poco más el acabado ya que tiene una asimetría en el cierre y no se ve estéticamente bien
3.0,"This fit great and worked for what I needed, I just wish it wasn't see through."
3.0,Fit is a little loose. Not a true skinny jean. Material is a little and cheap looking. Won't buy again.
3.0,the sides were a little&#34; flimpy&#34;
3.0,My wife wanted these since it was a cheaper alternative to buying prescription sunglasses.  They look great I. The picture by when we received them they are huge on your face.  We  expected them to be a bit large because they fit over regular glasses but dang these are huge.<br /><br />Maybe when she is 60 these will be better suited for her.
3.0,"It arrived very quickly. However, the color is not what I expected. It looks more like a muted, brownish pink instead of the beautifully vibrant blackened red shown in the picture. This is important because of my cool, Red undertones ... the muted color looks almost like mud on me. I should’ve stuck with my instincts and selected black.<br /><br />I’m also not a fan of the white backing. I will stick to walk-in, brick & mortar when shopping for scarves going forward."
3.0,It’s a mask!
3.0,"I like that they are adjustable to your disired coverage. Would have gave 5 stars, but they run small. Coverage in booty is full and won’t creep."
3.0,Emblem much larger and pronounced than photo shows
3.0,"Too short, was under the impression it was longer"
3.0,The bracelet was okay kind of cute
3.0,This bra is ok. It’s comfortable. I would consider it more of a lounge type bra. Not much support. If you need support this is probably not an ideal choice for you unless you plan on lounging in it. The material is nice and it is very comfortable.
3.0,No me agradó la tela ni el corte del short en las patas
3.0,The were not quite large enough for my somewhat wide face (and I’m a woman).  Also- the pic looks like they are rose tinted…not at all.  They simply have a pink mirrored coating and are otherwise the lenses are tinted blue/grey
3.0,"Overall, this dress is pretty nice.<br /><br />The fabric is really soft and comfortable. It's stretchy feeling. The pockets are also a really nice feature of course.<br /><br />On my body shape, I think the waistline is too high/so it has the effect of making my belly look like I'm pregnant. The arms also feel a bit tight on me. I am 5'4"" and about 145 lbs, and I tend to carry most of my weight in my mid section. Quite honestly, I've put on some covid weight, so that might have a lot to do with it. I would say it does fit true to size. I wear mediums in most things and this medium fits me the same as many other brands.<br /><br />The colors are really nice, and I think the print looks really great in person."
3.0,"Took FOREVER to receive, however product is as pictured. It does fit me a little big, I will probably tie it myself"
3.0,Animal print wasn’t vibrant as expected pattern could have been better otherwise nice blouse
3.0,I can say I like the blouse but it really doesn't look the same as to the blouse in the picture. The blouse I have is an off white with the same colors compared to the one in the picture.
3.0,Love the concept of these but dislikeghe quality of sunglasses
3.0,Muy pequeño.
3.0,From all the reviews it seemed it would fit bigger than expected.  I actually found  it smaller than expected
3.0,Runs small. Order 1-2 sizes up.  Good quality.  Extremely snug fit.
3.0,"These feel like cheap off-brand jeans. They don't feel like Levis, Gap, or any of the other jeans I have currently. They do fit well, but the material was more rigid than other new jeans I have purchased in past years. They look okay, but the pre-ripped knees are already starting to rip even further, which will soon render them unwearable to me. While I don't mind &#34;distressed,&#34; I do mind &#34;ripped to shreds.&#34;<br /><br />I only recently started purchasing jeans on Amazon. I've had great luck with ordering variations of the Levis I like, and I think for the price difference, I'll stick with them over this brand."
3.0,Loved the chameleon patina!  But the band is not perfect for persons with arthritis
3.0,"The fit wasn't what I expected it to be. It's almost like I could've sized down but it wasn't as cute to me in real life as it is in the ad. If I would have sized down, the dress would've been too small. I don't know, it was just odd fitting. I wish it was a less ""frumpy"" fit, if that makes sense."
3.0,Beware sizes are for junior/kid sizes and not for adults
3.0,From what I could tell was made out of nice material and would've been comfy to wear. I advise anyone interested in this to get a size or two larger than your normal size.
3.0,Cute dress but ours arrived with a hole at the top. Look it over before you decide to keep it.
3.0,They are nice in shape and look but very fragile and thinner than expected. Using the back security lock is a must.. I tried them on for the first time yesterday and one fell out without noticing and I cannot find it now. Luckily it has to be in the house as I haven’t left the house..
3.0,It’s was cheap and like the quote said bad hair day and that’s exactly what’s its for lol
3.0,"After a few use the boot looks too worn, but the fur will keep u warm, someone whos much taller and with narrow feet will compliment them much more"
3.0,They charms didn’t last long. I lost two and the remaining ones I have tarnished /:
3.0,What I didn't like about this product my pocketbooks seem to be too heavy so most of the holders broke.  What I love about this product is that its still holding up and it's convenient and out of the way as far as storage space.
3.0,"This product works wonders for my swollen, sore legs and the copper helps heal my stasis ulcers ONCE THEY ARE ON. I ordered the large/extra large because I wear a size 10 shoe but putting them on is almost impossible despite the instructions. Getting them off is just as bad and both procedures usually require a second person. And I’m not overweight and I don’t have big legs. Getting the stockings over the heel is very difficult and then they tend to roll up cutting off the circulation to my feet. Advertised as easy on easy off!!!"
3.0,I’m usually a medium but these are a little to tight
3.0,did not like fit
3.0,Not a good fit if you have large breasts.
3.0,I like this wig a lot it feels nice and such but its SOOOOOOOOO thin you can see the netting unless hanging just right so be careful. anyways I got it for a con and it works for that so I am happy overall
3.0,"The band it self is very pretty and well made; however, it is way to long. I needed to add more holes just to use it. I ended up not using because of the length. May be better if you have a large wrist."
3.0,Nice but would have prefer it bigger
3.0,These are good but not individually wrapped as stated.
3.0,"The first one I ordered was marked as delivered - but never showed up.  I reported it and they sent me a second one - this one did show up! It's a large, eye-catching ring. For the price, it's a good buy."
3.0,"I ended up buying this in a size up, I'm a medium 5'6 at 140 pounds. It fits a bit looser so I'd definitely say go for your size! The cutest thing about this dress is the buttons!! They're all different! I'll probably take it in a little. The dress fabric is soft, but definitely not something I see lasting long. I got this dress for a witches photoshoot will update once I do!"
3.0,Fit okay but the material isn’t stretchy
3.0,"Not so good in person , but acceptable"
3.0,Runs small and shorter than shown
3.0,I was excited to get this ring but the main stone was a lot smaller than the facets so it looks like the stone shrunk. It is still very pretty.
3.0,I am a 36 G or GG. This product fit as expected based on review and chart sizing conversion form US to EU. However the bra arrived smelling of chemical residue (glue?) very strongly. I have to wash it before wear to see if this factory smell goes away before I place it on skin. and wear this sucker out. I tried it on but haven't worn it yet.
3.0,Love the shirts very cool for work. Bought two a gray one and a red one. The gray one fits perfect just like an old one I had of this style. The red one is too big. I believe it was marked as the wrong size. Don't wear that one.
3.0,"The 'sherpa' lining is sparse and it is not overly oversized. I don't think I'll wind up overheating wearing this around my house so that's a plus and I love the cuffs, they feel very secure on my wrists."
3.0,Love the case but I don't think it is going to hold up. It has all ready started to crack. 😿
3.0,Glasses were great. Necklace broke right away!
3.0,Tight and hard to breath with
3.0,"My ex is wearing this, lol, but I'll do my best to review.  The sweater was VERY comfy and well-made and thick - definitely a winter sweater for here in the South. The main issue was the fit. My ex was 6'0 about 190 and the XXL was too snug on him even though we followed the fit guide.  He has a broad chest. This is made for skinny dudes."
3.0,"does not look like the picture, bags are not as solid as they look in the photo or as tall. zipper broke on one but I was able to get it closed, cheap, chinese. Still work fine on a budget, I will update the review after my vacation."
3.0,"First off, let me say the coat is pretty. It fits well,I used the size chart and had no problems whatsoever. The only things I didn't like were the material and there was an error made in the sewing. The material is paper thin and has a sheen to it. Feels almost silky, which is not a problem for some, I guess, but I was expecting a more tough raincoat feel. I also am not crazy about the sheen, but that's minor. It IS fully lined, but I can tell this is not going to be very warm, due to the paper thin texture. Also, there was an extra buttonhole on top, where there was no corresponding button. I think they made an error when sewing it. However, I can hide it if i pull the collar down and don't button the coat up all the way. Or by wearing a scarf. So overall, it's a pretty coat. Hope this is helpful to someone."
3.0,"I really liked this shirt at first except the neck was too big. After washing it a few times, the neck only got bigger. It doesn’t wash well because it has faded and began to look worn like it’s a few years old."
3.0,Daughter loved it picked it out because of the fun prints and the doll robe.<br />However for the price I would’ve expected better quality. Material is super thin. Like Dollar store blanket thin.<br />Just a couple of days old and it already is tearing in the pocket.<br />I would save my money and not purchase this item. But if you’re child really wants it . . . I guess.
3.0,Fantastic quality but it is in no way gray!!!! it is definaely more of a tan in person
3.0,"I ordered 3 shirts sized-up in various sizes and they still came in too small. The adult small (to fit my 5'1&#34;, 107 lb. daughter) fit my 10 year old grandson and the child sizes were extremely too small for my grandchildren.<br /><br />The material is thin but shirts are nicely sewn with straight stitching. No unraveled or loose threadings. Took 3 weeks to receive."
3.0,Were very comfy. Came with hole but still wore them anyways . Still salvageable with long shirt/sweater
3.0,"I sized up to an 8.5 and they were still too small. I am traditionally a 7.5 in all brand name shoes (heels, sandals, running shoes..). Seeing other reviews I seized up even more and they just didn't work out for me. I needed them that weekend so I didn't repurchase."
3.0,"The black and white shirts are confirmed 100% cotton, the colored stripes are 100% polyester! Keeping the cotton returning the polypoop. My usual size fit. Im 160 lbs 5'7.5 size L wide shoulders 36C"
3.0,Super cute but just fell apart on like day 2
3.0,I think I would have liked it more but I only wore it two hours before one of the tassels fell off
3.0,"There's an extra glare when wearing these glasses. They do well with UV protection, but i recommend taking them off before looking at your phone"
3.0,"It's  cute, I like it very much."
3.0,Small around the arm/shoulder other then that.  I like it
3.0,I ordered based on the measurements but I should have just ordered my usual size (Medium).  The materials of the top and the bottom clash and the color is also off.  I would have loved for this dress to work but I had to send it back.
3.0,"I bought these socks and the product name in bold says ""5 pack"". Just be careful b/c depending on what color you pick, you might only get 3 socks. The socks themselves are great, but beware of the quantity you will actually get."
3.0,Only one earring snaps closed... ..the other doesnt catch
3.0,"I really like the style of this dress but it faded quite a bit after two washings (cold, gentle cycle, hang to dry).  The fit is good I just won't get much use out of it with the fading."
3.0,I bought it 5 months ago and it's already broken :/ The part where the lanyard clips to tore for some odd reason.
3.0,Material breaks down quickly. Ingenious design takes a bit to get used to. I would probably by again if item was cheaper
3.0,Very pretty but size was a lot smaller I ordered a size 10 and it seemed like a size 8 can barely fit on the finger I was wanting to wear it on aside from the size it's a nice ring
3.0,"This is a beautiful watch band; however, one of the strap loops broke after only a few wearings."
3.0,"First, the positive: It is a lovely dress. The fabric is nice and soft and the Bohemian Mint dress has a liner to prevent it from being too see-through. It flows nicely and is very feminine. Decidedly a pretty thing,<br /><br />Second, the negative: As someone who is rather large chested, this dress is not flattering in that area in the sense that, it is all you see. The rest of the dress is flowy and thus the emphasis is on the one part of your anatomy where the fabric does not flow, but clings. I just would not be comfortable wearing it in public for that reason.<br /><br />I am returning the item, much to my chagrin."
3.0,I ordered this watch for my 15 year old son because he likes that style. We were both disappointed when it came in because it actually is a pretty small watch for a men's wrist... It almost looks like a kids watch. Other than that it looks nice.
3.0,This was an okay bag. I bought it for days when I wanted to carry less around. The seems and the stitching are both a little less durable than I hoped. We will see how it holds up.
3.0,Watclh was too small it's for kid arm but time was ok but box was damage
3.0,"Looks great and doesn't fall apart easily. I dont know if anyone else has the same problem or it's just me, but the white one turns a different color after wearing it for a bit. Even the black ones turn a different color but it's less visible due to it being black."
3.0,"First time I wore them, they were pretty good.  Didn't slip.<br />Unfortunately, after one wash, they don't stay on my heel anymore and keep slipping."
3.0,The shoulder straps are really short.
3.0,The shoe is great but narrow
3.0,I felt it was too tight around the leg part of the sock. I had to take it off after a few hours. Didn't find that it helped much.
3.0,Stitching is good for a slimfit. Fabric & color is not as appears in the pucture.
3.0,"There is no place to email you with tracking number as no email address is supplied in the return instructions.  The tracking number on the return is 1Z 2AO 572 90 1111 7476.  Otherwise I would not have left a  review.  Beautiful, just WAY to small."
3.0,"I thought these were compression tanks, but they look nice and soft fabric."
3.0,Color fades out
3.0,"I fixed the straps a few times after they've broken. They weren't connected to the dress very sturdily. Other than that, the dress is adorable and very comfortable"
3.0,I like it BUT I wear a small and I ordered a large--it's too small!  I am really disappointed.  I want to send it back but there's no return slip.
3.0,"These were super cute but incredibly big. I'm a 2 & these leggings in a S/M were incredibly big. They are super cute, but just too big on me."
3.0,My wife loved how they looked. She loved the pearls and model design. The fit was bad as they taper and get larger and they were not working well for her.
3.0,"When these arrived, I could see why some people would receive their earrings broken because the packaging is just a little plastic baggie. Fortunately, mine were still intact when they arrived around the estimated date. These earrings are beautiful, it's just that the design is a little strange. So the clamp for the earlobe is adjustable; there are screws to play around with to get the desired width. And the cartilage cuffs are somewhat bendable. However, when I lined up my pair of earrings, the clamps did not line up, which is probably why the right earring doesn't sit as comfortably on my ear as the left one. I really wanted these earrings to work, but when I first tried these on, my right ear turned all red and got irritated. When I tried them on a second time, the cartilage cuff for the right earring broke off, but I actually prefer that, because I can clamp the earring a bit higher on my lobe, and the wing can rest comfortably in the curve of my ear. I think these would be suitable to wear for special occasions, and I still like how they look. So, thank you, seller."
3.0,"Fit way to big I'm a M and got a 44 and it's way to big,overall  it's nice and a nice material, runs big"
3.0,Hat came folded up in the package and the brim is out of shape and I not able to straighten it out.
3.0,"Im loving them, Im getting prescription lens in these frames"
3.0,"I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the product photos, because I didn't realize just how much this hugs your waist and hips. If you have any kind of belly at all, avoid this skirt. It will show every bit of it as unflatteringly as possible."
3.0,The dress looks nice but the stitching is uneven.  Unfortunately it was poorly made. I still wear it  occasionally because a belt can hide the flaws and it’s comfortable.
3.0,I ordered 6-12 months but fits more like 12-18 months
3.0,"I was a little underwhelmed upon opening.  Maybe it was the cute albeit but definitely not luxe way of packaging.  Each necklace presented on a cardboard square then wrapped in plastic sleeve.  Or it could be the necklaces themselves.  They are okay, but just okay.  They are fine but don’t look high end.  But i say that with a decent sized jewerly collection so may be looking at these with an overly picky eye.  I don’t doubt that any of my college and high school nieces would love these so i will most likely give to one of them.  Or make it give to two of them since they are already packaged that way."
3.0,"It's nice and all, but it was too small for me and i thought the lens would be a little bigger"
3.0,Would not recommend for full sized ties only the skinny ones as the clip is not long enough to attach full sized tie to shirt without the tie being crooked. I suppose it could work for somebody with full tie but only if the keep the clip close to the top of the shirt but then the clip loses its function.
3.0,straps are to far apart.  constantly falling.
3.0,"It is a decent work/school bag for the price, it’s holds a laptop, tablet and small notebook. I really like the mesh pockets for chargers. But the other pockets are thin and rip easily. Sturdy for some weight. The main zipper is cheap and splits if you try to close it."
3.0,"Not exactly what I expected but, good product."
3.0,"Small, ears are really close together. I gave them to my daughter. I'll buy them at the park where I can try them on."
3.0,The colors peal after a few days of wearing. Other then that their ok.
3.0,"The color is great and it is very light weight, but the face looks manly. In other words it doesn't look feminine."
3.0,If these were uniform size I would like them but somehow they are different sizes. The 3 that fit are great
3.0,"Design is cool but unfortunately the latch comes open very easily. Also, the finish scratches off fairly easily too. I wouldn't consider for every day use. My keys have came off numerous times in a store, luckily I found them every time."
3.0,Its ok.. i think the bands willl break
3.0,I thought it was larger
3.0,Looks like boys Military boots on the outside with a girls liner on the inside . Terrible fit for kids with normal feet but your child has a club foot it be the best fitting boot ever !
3.0,I just wish it was a little bigger. It's a cute zipper attachment but small and kinda hard to make out the cat. This is a size compared to a quarter
3.0,"It does look like the picture. I ended up returning it though. I’m short  (5ft even) and, unfortunately, I just looked like a baked potato in this thing."
3.0,Very warm comfortable hoodie. I ordered my true size and it is a bit snug around the bust area. I would definitely recommend ordering a size up for sure.
3.0,Very cute But it Running very small. I had to return mine.
3.0,"Cute design. Looks just like the picture, but definitely runs small. Usually wear a L, bought an XL and still was a bit close."
3.0,I was really excited about the turquoise ring but it isn't at all what the photo looks like. It's clear with turquoise glitter. I think these are over priced for the quality of rings you get.
3.0,Not good fit but okay for the price
3.0,It does meet with the picture shown but not my expectations.
3.0,Just didn't like the way it fit
3.0,Ok for what you paid for. The different strings are different lengths so it kind of bunches a bit
3.0,Bought as a gift. Fit runs small so I  ordered the next size up. Good thing I did!
3.0,"So I've been using this wallet for a little over a month, it finally decides to break on me, the lanyard came apart, keep in mind that I didn't fill it with a lot of things, it was a great wallet on then the fact that it broke on me"
3.0,"My daughter loved the Ray Ban case that came with her sunglasses, but she carries it in her purse all the time. After a year and a half the cover started to separate form the rest of the case. It is great you can get a replacement, but I think you are paying more for the name than the quality of the product. I would like it better for less."
3.0,"If you're looking for a sun block of about 85%, these are great.  But, if you'd like to see where you're going, not a good choice!  But, they are cute and I only purchased for a one time use, or I would return."
3.0,"My first thought upon pulling it out of the box was, ""This is cheap."" However, it is very pretty and looks flattering on my body. The material is thinner than I expected and it fits a bit loosely. My husband says it is gorgeous though. It will be good to wear when it is hot outside due to the thin fabric. Overall, it's an okay dress."
3.0,Not really flattering but very comfortable.
3.0,"It is an attractive watch but runs too big for me.  I buy this type of watch because usually they are small.  I can no longer get watch salespeople in stores to shorten bands like they did in the past.  Therefore I no longer purchase those watches, but rather bracelet watches.  I find it difficult to find bracelet watches where I can try them on.  Usually I find them on line.  I won't be able to wear this one.  It is MUCH too big.  It will be a gift to a larger woman."
3.0,"This is the style I was looking for.  They were a little difficult to put on, but very comfortable.  I wore them and even slept in them for a few days, but when I removed them I saw that they had turned my piercing holes black.  I had a hard time removing the residue from my ears (using alcohol).  It was inside and outside my holes.  I will not be wearing them again."
3.0,"I was really happy to get this. However, when I took it out of the package and tried to clasp it, the clasp was broken. It looked like it was missing a piece connecting it to the main part of the necklace. I had to take apart one of the loops in another piece of jewelry to fix it. I really did not want to do that. I expected it to arrive in one piece. After fixing it, It looks great on my neck."
3.0,"Love the design, but too small.  I would love it about twice as large."
3.0,The best shows well with the buckle being a classic nice look and the colors of the black and brown are spot on. My concern is the longevity as within just a few weeks the bend in the belt where I wear it is creasing in a way that seems as though it will wear poorly more quickly than higher quality belts. The sizing is accurate and the fit is nice. For the price it’s good just seems like for $10 more you can find one that’ll hold up better over time.
3.0,Very cute but very long
3.0,"It’s a lovely necklace. It gets three stars because it is NOT obelisk shaped like the picture. Mine came in smooth and rectangular, so I have no idea what shape you’ll get id you order it. Still pretty. Still sodalite. I still wear it. But it’s not the obelisk shape that I thought I was getting."
3.0,Inexpensive shower flops. Dry nicely. Wouldn't want to have to walk far in them!
3.0,"The fit is OK and comfortable.  The problem is; I wanted a green bra.  This bra is listed as dark green; but its not.  The photo is misleading.  This bra is blue.  I would list it as Peacock Blue (the hues are blue, not green).  So, if you want a comfortable, Peacock Blue bra, this would be a good choice.  If you want Green; look elsewhere."
3.0,Big enough but pattern only on one side.
3.0,"The quality was some what ok, it has more of a plastic feel, also a bit stiff so it could take a while for it to break in, because it was stiff it didn’t form  well with my wrist and didn’t track all my workouts. Now if you don’t track your workouts I guess it would b ok."
3.0,Not sure I like the rose gold
3.0,"Fits well and is a flattering design and material. HOWEVER, the leg holes come extremely high up the sides--meaning my upper thigh/hip area was still visible even when I put shorts over the bodysuit. It looked a little ridiculous."
3.0,Two of the shirts fit great but one seems smaller than the others.
3.0,The dress is suppose to be a newborn but fits like a 6montha. Very cute and was excited for family pictures but it’s to big
3.0,"I got the 3x so that I could wear these over my clothes when needed. No such luck. They fit like 2x pants, no way I could wear them over anything."
3.0,Nice color.. a bit snug around the bust but large in the torso area.
3.0,"At a glance it looks kinda cool, but quality was not as expected, I know is a good price but if you compare the quality of this steel band to the quality of the rubber bands there is a very big difference.<br /><br />I still use it ocasionally cus frankly it looks a bit fancy, locking mechanism is pretty fair and works flawlesly until now.<br /><br />As different from other steel bands this one comes with tools to adjust, this is a big plus cus the moment you get it you want to try it on and not wait to go to a shop."
3.0,These were exactly what I was hoping for.  However they are not true to size.  I wanted them baggy so I got  size bigger than normal and it was still 3 sizes too small.  Perhaps they sent the kids version????
3.0,Great color but not good quality.
3.0,I bought these socks more for the look than actually wearing them and that’s a good thing. They are VERY small!
3.0,After placing them correctly this move and spin and they hurt your ears
3.0,"Thin material, runs a little small"
3.0,I like these earrings but the stud doesn't go all the way into the ball on 1 of the gold earrings so it sticks out of my ear pretty far. I think it is defective.
3.0,"It's just ok, fit small, ask for 1/2 number larger."
3.0,"My wife really liked the look of these boots. Unfortunately they are very difficult to get on her feet. You have to use a lot of force to stretch the elastic type opening to get a foot in, mind you, she has narrow feet. She also said that once on, they were not comfortable, but seem true to size. Some have mentioned these are well made, but I have to disagree. For the price, I don't think they're worth the cost. You could find some quality brand name boots on sale or clearance, that would have better material and construction. These might work for some women just based on the look, and their physical foot type. Just don't expect comfort and quality from these."
3.0,I got a small and it fit like a medium. They were too loose on me instead of being a close fit.
3.0,"The fit in the thumb is a bit loose, but overall they fit well and work."
3.0,"The speaker with the music controls has distorted sound at high volume right out of the box. Other than that, it’s a decent Bluetooth hat. Easy pairing and simple controls."
3.0,These dresses are huge! I ordered a smaller size and it still didn’t fit right! Very unflattering! Returned both
3.0,I order L and it didn't fit me....too small I guess XL is like L because L is like Small.
3.0,"It's nice, but the arms are small, and the shoulder cut-outs look weird on me. I don't have overly large arms, either. I exercise, but don't focus on my arms. This is just better on people with skinny arms I guess. Fits great otherwise!"
3.0,"I would like to know if there’s a way to wear this on one of those necklace charm holders, so it would feel more stable and not twisting the chain."
3.0,"I was very disappointed by the size. The feathers  were falling out .  I ordered this to go on a wreath for Halloween. I guess part of the blame is mine because I should have read  the complete descreption, This hat would be good for a small dog if you plan on dressing one for Halloween.<br />Wanda Cline"
3.0,It’s good material but much longer than I expected for someone short. More like a dress. I’m sure it fits well on someone 5’5 or taller.
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, 160lbs and ordered a large. It hits my ankles, and fits my waist just fine. Material is nice, pattern is beautiful. Complaints are that the liner only goes to knees, and the elastic in the back wasn't properly encased. They sewed it in so it gathers in weird spots making the skirt pop out strangely. Fortunately I know how to sew so I can easily fit this problem. I'd recommend for the price. If it was $25, no I wouldn't recommend."
3.0,"I like this shirt in the pictures, but I did not love how it looks on me. I am 5'9"" tall, and this shirt barely covered to my waist. The large buttons left a gap in the fabric between the last button and where the shirt ended, so it shows more of my stomach than I would like. Therefore, it won't tuck into my pants like the picture shows. The cut is also very boxy and not flattering. The material is a nice color, and it washes well, although it is more prone to wrinkles than some other fabrics. Overall, I don't like this style on me, but it could work well for someone with a shorter torso and who has a nicer stomach than me and wants to show it off."
3.0,"I lost the first pair that were given to me as gifts, and I re-ordered these thinking that the depth of the stud's head as pictured (the circular, round face) was more shallow.  The picture made it difficult to see that it protrudes further than you might think.<br /><br />I just like having stud faces really close to my ear.<br /><br />Apparently, these give off the illusion of gauging.  Several people made comments about them, and I wasn't aware of what they were talking about."
3.0,"Beautiful earrings and well made; however, I can only give 3 stars because I received the wrong color. I ordered red and received a fleshy pink color."
3.0,I like the style. Need it to have lighter material and a little wider for comfort.
3.0,Ordered two sizes because I never know. I ordered an L and an XL. The XL was smaller than the L! Luckilly L fit nicely and it still worked out but be careful when ordering.
3.0,"The bars are very short, and the gauge wasn't what I needed, but it shipped super fast"
3.0,good for the price but small and thin
3.0,This dress would be cuter if it was a little more formfitting. I know it’s supposed to be relatively loose but it is just too loose. Almost as if though it doesn’t have shape.
3.0,I am 5’2” and the length was good.  The top was thin and requires a bra which isn’t easy to conceal.  I selected white and that could have been part of it he problem
3.0,This is really short it doesn't cover a little pudge if you have one.  Looks stupid off shoulders.
3.0,This was purchased as a Halloween outfit. I am glad I didn't expect my son to wear it next summer. The seam on the shirt is coming out already. He wore it 2x for a total of less than 6 hours.
3.0,Very cute top. Need to order 2 sizes larger than you wear.
3.0,I ordered a large which is my normal fit for shirts and this shirt was a bit too tight around my bust. It was also a little short for my liking.
3.0,Es muy ancho
3.0,"Quick shipping, but not nearly as pretty as in the picture."
3.0,Does not work for my action heat vest
3.0,A bit smaller than I hoped. Pretty flimsy but haven't broke yet.
3.0,"Correct sizing. But the cardigan looked nothing like the picture. The colors were very dull and it's so thin that you can see through it. Not what I was expecting, but the wife says it's ok."
3.0,This dress was not true to size but it was so cute that I didn't want to waste it so I passed it on to a friend. Definitely order at least one size larger.
3.0,"They're not 100% sterling silver. The posts are a darker metal, looks like steel. The bars are a little short too, but enough to hold the earring in place. Guess they're trying to cut costs, but still, they should mention that they aren't fully sterling silver. For their price, you can get a true silver set. They're pretty otherwise, the stones are clear and sparkly."
3.0,I had to return this dress.  The buttons on the bodice were spaced oddly and made the dress gap on me.  Its a gorgeous dress and very flattering otherwise.  I'm broad shouldered and think that may have made it worse.  Bustier or broad shouldered women may have an issue with this dress which is otherwise very flattering and gorgeous on.
3.0,We really liked these but the backs came off super quickly!
3.0,Purchased based on measurements. It's small across the hips. I would recommend to go one size up if you are not slim in the hips. Material is nice.
3.0,Didn’t realize it was a crop top
3.0,"They fit well, but sleeves get mis-shapen when worn.  Poor quality material."
3.0,Very thin naterial
3.0,Wish this dress came in larger sizes. It’s a nice dress just runs small.
3.0,One of the shoe laces was not working but kept it anyway to save the hassle of returning it back
3.0,"It fits, it's just not as long as I thought it would be<br />  Shows more of my stomach then I thought it would.  Soft material."
3.0,The product has a big hole in the right packet..
3.0,Way too big after i read the reviews and sizing guide.
3.0,I used these for shower shoes on two business trips after recovering from three foot surgeries resulting from an infection.  I had trouble getting them adjusted to stay on properly.  The soles were very thin and I found myself tripping on them a couple of times.  I've already replaced these with cheap flip flops.
3.0,"These are really soft but do not stay on feet. I had to return these as the person sent wrong size, the M/L fit about a size 7 to 7/12 shoe size. I have a pair I bought from a store. It's a very soft product. Nice other than they don't stay on feet very well. I bought elastic I thought about stitching on a strap."
3.0,Price and quality is good. It's just that it took me three hours to punch the hole and get the sizing correct on myself. I'd probably want to pay more money and get the sizing right than do the work myself at that point.
3.0,"Very well made, but too small for our 4 year old who wears size 5.  Will be returning. Very disappointed."
3.0,Nice band but too loose for regular wear
3.0,"I ordered a size small. I'm 5'1 and 115 lbs for reference. The shirt was oversized, which I was fine with, but the shorts were more like an XS. Ended up returning. The set was cute though."
3.0,"Looks decent. Links aren't well put together though, they can come apart easily, I had to tighten each and every one. Find another necklace I say."
3.0,"I like the ring but the detailing has left something to be desired. the lettering around the face is not clear and you cant hardly read what it says, but other than that it is ok"
3.0,Found out all copperfit compression is on 8-14 mmhg.
3.0,"Great gloves, ordered the $T fit great. But shipping was very slow even for 1 day shipping.  My first pair was lost in the mail."
3.0,Wasnt impressed with the overall fit.
3.0,"Really one of these to work. But the toe box is too small. They’re nice looking, but they just didn’t work for me."
3.0,"Es bonito pero se ve trili o sea muy poco si éso no vale el precio, deben venderlo a 00.1 okisssss"
3.0,"Cute ,smells like leather feels nice but fades a bit quici if you get it wet."
3.0,It was much bigger than I expected so I returned it.
3.0,This cardigan is nothing special. Very thin and can be seen through. It took forever to receive even though it was a Prime item. I would pass if I knew what I know now.
3.0,The strap cracked a few days after I had it.  Wore it twice
3.0,I did not like the way it was sewn from the side to the underarm it pulled.
3.0,SIZE IS NOT THE PERFECT MATCH.
3.0,"For such a low price, this can't be perfect, but it is cute! I just wish it was more true to size!"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:93a606fcfbdfcfa08ecddb63bbfdde9f]] broken  for the third use
3.0,too small for an xl
3.0,"Very pretty and I received a lot of compliments when I wore this to a wedding. However, I have a tiny, tiny neck so it looks a little awkward on me and there's no way to hide the ends since they come almost all the way around to the design on my neck, so lesson learned that this type of necklace just isn't for me."
3.0,The clip broke after one week of use.
3.0,It's been a year and it's falling apart pretty bad. We get what we pay for.
3.0,I thought this dress would be a little looser. The material is thick and not at all very stretchy. If it wasnt as short as it was on me...it could probably be paired with a cardigan and wore.
3.0,"Leak sometimes , you can increase the compression to prevent it but hurts face after a while"
3.0,"They are good as an undergarment for a jacket, but the quality is not great."
3.0,"Shinny, I thought it was going be more of a brushed finish. Looks good any way."
3.0,Fabric already had a run in it. I didn’t mind the large armholes bc that is the style.
3.0,"I used each wallet less than 2 weeks a piece and the both broke the same way. Luckily, they broke when it wasn't around my neck so I didn't loose any cards! Products need stronger loops to attach to lanyard."
3.0,Looks just like the picture on for me. I think it's a slightly bad design as the cutoff of the black and white bands falls in the middle of the chest and it looks a little wierd to me. I like the length though as it covers my backside nicely so it goes well with leggings. Fabric is flowy and comfortable.
3.0,This is a nice looking shirt but the sizing is extremely small. I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone that normally wears size Large shirts.  I ordered a large and it was too small so I returned it and ordered an XL and it was still too small.  I ended up returning it finding something else.
3.0,Unique sleeves make this sweater a REAL head turner - lots of compliments!  Fits a little large but fashionably so.  Can’t give it more than 3 stars as the ruffles on the sleeves came undone after only 2 wearings.  Needed to be re-sewn.
3.0,Cute but way too small. Sizing is confusing. The company must be spending a fortune on returns.
3.0,"Ordered a size up. It fit in the shoulders but the body was huge, so I just tucked it in."
3.0,"The emblem doesn’t look as big or pronounced, nor is it raised. Not as beautiful in person."
3.0,"I received these leggings today, and they look NOTHING like the picture! I got the light blue one, and what I got instead was a dark blue, with weird white marks on it. It fit fine, but seriously, it does not look like the picture, I spent $20, for this, and this is what I get, something that is nothing like the pictures! I'll probably still wear it though, I spent money on it. But seriously, this was such a disappointment."
3.0,"I normally wear an xl in tops size 20 pants so I originally ordered the xl, that was too small so I sent it back and got the 3xl thinking if it's a little baggy that would be fine. That was not the case.... I do carry most of my weight in my hip/lower stomach area so maybe it's just me but I was very disappointed in the fit. In other news the material is soft and smooth and I like the look of it if you don't have curves like mine I would recommend it"
3.0,"Cute and Carter’s is always good quality but the shorts are a BRIGHT neon yellow, to me they don’t seem that bright in the photo."
3.0,"Color bleeds. They're comfortable to wear and they block the light completely for me, but the color bleeds onto my pillow. Even after several washings, soaking, everything I've tried, they still bleed.<br /><br />I bought a black pillow case so I wouldn't see the stains. But I can't use them while traveling, unless my host has black bed linens."
3.0,"The peplum style on this is so exaggerated that it's basically one big triangle. It looked like a tent on my short frame (I'm 5'2""). I tried belting, tying the front, tucking it in - nothing about this is flattering on my pretty short, pretty busty (32GG), a little fat (150 lb) frame.<br /><br />That said, the quality is good - it's a nice material, soft with nice draping despite it not being too thick to be comfortable. The stitching is nice. Just didn't suit."
3.0,Absolutely no compression.  I got my size and even though it's big on me I don't think getting a smaller size would make it any less a standard tank top.
3.0,"As far as knock offs go, this one is pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. For fitting reference, I ordered the M, im 5'5&#34;/150lbs/have two kids.  Cons: the inside stitching is very itchy on my torso. I'll have to figure out what to line it with, or wear some kind of cami under it for the event I'm attending. The zipper functions, barely- always pull the fabric together when zipping/unzipping, it feels like it's looking for an excuse to break.<br />Pros: it looks just like the Unique Vintage dress I almost paid $188 for. I look and feel great wearing this! It has a flattering cut and unlike other reviewers mine arrived with no defects.  I'm so glad I found this. Now I can spend all the extra on shoes 😍"
3.0,Very cute but not as deep as I expected it to be
3.0,It didn’t come with the pins to attach the straps the reason I bought the straps for the watch was the othe strap broke and the pin is gone so now I have two straps and no way to connect them
3.0,"The size guide is too ambitious - consider this a US small if you want something opaque. I'm 5'2&#34; and 135 lbs so I was testing the tensile strength of these. The print is vibrant and cute otherwise. The other issue I had was the elastic waistband: there's actually a strip of elastic sewn inside, which I didn't expect based on every other similar item I own. It just felt funny, so these had to go back."
3.0,Really nice dress but not a good fit for a bigger woman:(
3.0,It’s ok but doesn’t look anywhere near as it does in photos. Wouldn’t buy again
3.0,"The vest fit nice (i ordered one size up).  I was not happy with how the material was though.  It is like a woven mesh fabric.  I was expecting it to be more like my textile jackets, but it wasn't.  The construction was very good and it fit well, just not to my taste."
3.0,LIKED THE COLORS FITS FINE<br />HATED THE MONTH IT TOOK TO GET HERE<br />SHOPPERS BEWARE....PAY ATTENTION TO SHIPPING DATES
3.0,"My necklace was worn to the beach and it turned colors pretty quick.. like within a day. However, for the money I spent on it I didn't expect much! It was cute while it lasted, though! :)"
3.0,This arrived promptly and the color is as described. The length is shorter than what is shown in the picture and the blouse was small.
3.0,"This will be a mutual review. The cut and style of the dress is very cute and dainty. The length is good even with some wedges on. I'm 5'4. The fabric however is shiny and feels like Halloween costume like. I ordered the white colored dress and from the pictures I thought it would be cotton or some type of fabric not like this Halloween fabric. Definitely see through from the bottom up. Requires a slip. Some people might like this fabric because it feels cool to the touch. However, it's not for me. Great cut. Great design. Great length and fits as expected. Not the fabric I thought it'll be."
3.0,Not sure I like the material...would beuch better in tshirt material
3.0,Bought this for my daughter and quality wasn’t as good as I thought but price is ok.
3.0,Beautiful dress a little too tight.
3.0,"The picture gives a wrong image. Seems nicer than it is. Nothing special about it, just regular."
3.0,Very cute but computer vision didn't work for me.
3.0,Smell musty
3.0,Super cute. It's a stretchy material but thick. Not worried about it ripping or tearing. It was just a little too snug for me. I should've went w my first<br />Instinct and got one size larger.
3.0,Smaller than expected. Leather looks more plastic than expected but they're cute. Ok for the price.
3.0,"So cute. Love the pattern, it is a bit transparent so I wish the fabric was a little bit thicker. It is just stretchy enough that it falls great on different body types however."
3.0,"This bikini is adorable, and I so wanted it to fit me.  I am 5 foot 3, and small on top.  I usually wear a small.  I ordered a small and a medium to see what would fit the best.  The bottom is perfect, but both the small and medium top is way too large for my 34B chest.  Bummer.  Good thing Amazon offers free returns on these."
3.0,"These leggings somehow made my booty look smaller!! I don’t have the biggest booty in the world, but I have a little bit of one. These leggings gave me a complete pancake, I was so disappointed. I feel like they are only flattering if you have a very large booty. They also rolled down on me in the first few minutes of trying them on. On the bright side they are very soft and almost kept them to just lounge in because of that. I am 5’ 4” and wear a size 8 in jeans and the medium fit me."
3.0,The pattern is not like in the picture.
3.0,"Great fit and shape but fall apart very easily.  For the price, they are good but wouldn't expect them to last with regular wear and washing."
3.0,"They work, but very tight on my 6 yr old. It's odd bc he does not have a wide head. He can wear then for ~15mins, then says his head hurts."
3.0,I'm still deciding if I will keep this purchase. I is voluminous.  I'm not sure if I will wear it. I bought it for a beach cover-up.
3.0,"It fits, the tag is bothersome though.  I gave one to my son and he cut the tag off..."
3.0,These are great workout shirts.
3.0,The shoe is very nice very well put together but it runs larger than a regular sneaker but a half size larger
3.0,Shipped quickly but seem a little tight for medium sizing.
3.0,The sleeves are too tight although the neck size is ok
3.0,"very cute dress, but size is little bigger than i thought. i ordered small, but it still too large for me."
3.0,It says that this is a sweatshirt but it is not as heavy as a sweatshirt. I still like the style but it is not what I expected. Glad I got a large enough size to wear another shirt under it.
3.0,I'm sure it would be great if it fit. Sleeves are real tight. Seems like you should order 2 sizes larger than normal.
3.0,"I really like this dress. It is beautiful on but sadly, if you have a large bust, it is extremely revealing and has zero support. I had to return it but did entertain the idea of taking it to get it altered. I ended up giving up after trying to think up solutions to the bust issue. If the triangles were bigger and the bust line was more fitted, it would have been a hit."
3.0,"Nice earrings, just wish the color was on the back as well, the back is all white."
3.0,Ran very small. Got a size larger then I normally get and it was still very small
3.0,These pants are really high waisted and super stretchy. These are not pants that you can see through which is good. They fit super thigh and snuggly to body. The only con about this product is that they don’t run true to size. I bought my reg size and they are super thought to get my pants on it’s so difficult but once on they are ok. I just wish I ha Rhine up one size.
3.0,The bracelet is a little too big
3.0,Great fitting glasses BUT they broke on the 35th day.
3.0,first...and last time I will purchase titanium...a learning experience.
3.0,Many of them were no longer working but overall they were liked
3.0,It’s a good shirt but order up at least one size maybe two. Also I’m 5’10” and it didn’t cover my butt at all.
3.0,Fine card holder but received a different color than I purchased. Doesn't look very classy.<br /> Kept it anyway because it is small and very handy to tuck in a coat pocket.
3.0,I heard about this company on Instagram. I should have paid attention to the size chart. I’m almost a week postpartum ordered an XL and they are too small. The website has more appropriate size options.
3.0,"I love the look of these sunglasses, but I do not think they are polarized. I was specifically looking for polarized sunglasses because I feel you have less glare and a clearer view from a polarized lens. These create a glare on everything."
3.0,"Dress is really heavy, not good for warm weather."
3.0,"Three stars becaysse this is definitely not a longer fitting crop top as shown, but still a nice top"
3.0,It's really great for the price ! I didn't expect high quality fabric . It's fun
3.0,Too tight...size one up
3.0,It fits ok. I’m an xl on top and that’s the size I got. But it’s a bit tighter than other xl’s I have. It does feel like good support but I would size up for a comfortable fit.
3.0,"Originally ordered medium and it was way too big.  Replaced with a small (5'6"" - 140lbs, 34A) and the fit is much better although still big up top.  I shortened the straps as small as they would go and it's ok.  Dress is much cuter with the 'apron' tied in the back.  When it's tied in front, it makes me look frumpy.  In the floral print (white with red flowers), the print on the fabric is lighter on the underside of the apron so it also looks kinda funny tied in the back (although still much more flattering).  Overall, it's cute, and I'll wear it, and the price was good."
3.0,Works n sticks on well but very very small! I got a D cup as that's what I normally wear for bras n the measurements matched up but when I got it it only covers about 1/4 of my actual breats...
3.0,"This is not a set intended for multiple uses. The clasps on the suspenders kept coming apart when we tried to move them. We only needed this for prom, and don't intend to use them again so for the money it was worth it. The bowtie was nivet, bit the part that wraps around the neck was real flimsy, but did the job."
3.0,Very soft but not as long as I expected.
3.0,"Not skirt, not even a tutu. Different tulle colors are separate and not attached together"
3.0,They run small but solf and beautiful
3.0,it sheds to much for my liking but its still a great product and i cant wait to wear it to EDCLV
3.0,The top to set was too small
3.0,"Dress is super cute, not too short, and is a lovely green color, but the straps! Those straps kept falling! So annoying!!"
3.0,It was cute but the shorts was too big. Unless you have butt cheeks with thighs🤣🤣 I got a XL 200Lbs not too much down bottom. But if you are bottom heavy these will work for you sis
3.0,"While the bodice fits, the skirt is too long even with heels on to walk in. Tripping all over the place. Probably the intended style, but if I can't walk in it, it won't work. The flower bits are glued on in some parts while sort of hanging off at some edges; not sure if this is intentional or poor quality."
3.0,Magnet sticks to every piece of metal and there band tends to always loosen on its own. I'm constantly having to adjust it
3.0,I only received the white bow when I thought I was supposed to get the white one and the black one. But the quality of the white one is very good.<br />So obviously I complained about the missing bow and they promptly fixed it. Should be getting it in a few days
3.0,The necklace  claspe would not open. My husband had to use needle nose pliers to get it open. It doesn’t close properly but at least mom was able to wear it today.  It is very pretty though and I would buy from this vendor again was just disappointed in the claspe.
3.0,"Runs a bit small, material is ok. Quality is ok."
3.0,"Wanted to try made to order and the shirt fits well enough, and I like the material, but the sleeves are oddly cut. Don't know the right terms, but the seam for the sleeves starts about 1/4 of the way up my shoulder. very different than the other tee shirts I have."
3.0,"The color and quality are both great. However, the band is super long. I have small wrists and in order to get it tight enough, the band wraps all the way around my wrist."
3.0,"While this is a flattering design, the material is very flimsy, lighter than tee shirt material and cut bigger."
3.0,Very pretty though bigger than I expected
3.0,"I just wasn't a big fan of these. I purchased the tan pair and the combo of the straps, round toe and color were horribly unflattering on me. I'm short and athletic so my calves are a little bigger and these just didn't work! Also, they weren't very comfortable, the leather around my toes cut into my skin. Maybe they'd work well for someone else but just not for me!"
3.0,Good length if you're Short. Fabric nice.
3.0,Haven't tried actually wearing it yet.  Just tried it on.  Would be better if it wrapped around your arm a little more. And I am fairly thin.  I hesitate to bend it until I am actually going to go out in it.  But pattern is well done.
3.0,"It really does say 'AN'.  Dont buy.  Good quality, but not correct"
3.0,the item tends to create a bulge in the stomach area.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 140...no belly but the hoodie bulges in the belly when zipped.  Gotta tailor better.
3.0,"Good, thick but One size is a joke. I am a size 6 and feel like a stuffed  sausage in these!"
3.0,have to change it
3.0,"Darn, they are long, more like capri pants than shorts. So, you spend a lot of time on your knees (these are well below them), these are the shorts (?) for you."
3.0,Es muy bello aún que el amarillo es muy claro demasiado claro
3.0,"I ordered this for my turning 4 years old niece - she’s a huuuuge makeup & hair play kid, so this will be a hit.<br />The vest is a comfortable fabric that feels like some sort of microfiber & there’s Velcro panels on both sides for adjustable fit.<br />HOWEVER — 2 things:<br /><br />(1) Supposedly, there’s a headband in this set. What I got was a piece of fabric SEWN onto the back of the vest! It’s not detachable - it’s completely stitched into the seam. So, there will be a weird floppy fabric strip on her back?<br />I thought maybe I could snip it off, but it’s literally part of the seam, so no way. The child won’t care, but c’mon.<br /><br />(2) The size of the included tools is quite small - I put a teaspoon next to them for scale. While this is marketed for ages 3-8, I would say it’s more like 3-5 size hands. They’re cute for imaginary play & the blow dryer makes a little whirring sound.<br /><br />Bottom line? Decent toy for specific kids, but be aware of what I wrote above!<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**"
3.0,Too big and the good part  look really cheap
3.0,I loved the earring very sparkly. However I bought this item may 27th and today it broke as I was taking it off. It didn’t even last me a month. The ball piece detached from the stick
3.0,"Product works as advertised, though I would prefer a less sloppy fit. Glow area sits very low on shirt. As noted in headline, the package says Large as ordered, but product is XL. Was ordered as a gift, so there was a delay in opening the package. Discovered the incorrect size too late to return."
3.0,The top was really fitted and bottoms were too small
3.0,"Not that thick, kind of short, pretty thin"
3.0,These earrings are super lightweight. You forget you have them on. Just as pictured.
3.0,"These are for young children for sizing.  I bought theses for a 9 year child, and found that even though a small 9 year old.. he needed a small adult size.  I returned these without a problem."
3.0,I love the idea of this bra and the ties worked really well for adding support and making cleavage. The downside is that it’s not sticky enough so I’m disappointed.  Had to keep pressing it against my breasts.  Maybe if you have smaller breasts it would work better?
3.0,"Bought a size S for Mom, a really petite lady, measuring 5' & 90-lb.  The top is way too tight and the side zipper is very difficult to zip up, especially at the mid-rif section where there are extra fabric from the seams of the top and the bottom skirt.  She could not zip up the dress without assistance.  The positives are: the length of the dress and the overall look of the dress after you struggled to get in.  That's why we are keeping the dress and gave it a 3-star."
3.0,I got these for my son who typically wears a size 8 in underwear and these are way too small. I checked against his regular underwear and it’s about an inch smaller than his usual pairs.
3.0,Super cute but the sleeves were short so I’ll be returning
3.0,Wanted it as a costume for a 70s show. Size did not match the chart.
3.0,"Let's face it, you get what you pay for. These are not highend glasses, but they get the job done."
3.0,"The dress is pretty, and in the pictures it looks good but I did not feel comfortable in the dress. It's very thinly lined so it shows every little curve and imperfection. I am 5'6, 123 lbs and ordered a medium - size was fine but again, I didn't like the fit. This dress has a bit of a train so keep that in mind when ordering and choosing your shoes."
3.0,"The watch is very pretty, but I had to give it away because it is a large band. Probably size 8 inch or above."
3.0,Don't bother with these if you're over 6' tall
3.0,"It was somewhat smaller than I had expected. The rim of the hat does not hold its shape as well as the picture shows, so it is not as fashionable as the picture. But the rim is very big which I like. It keeps the sun from hitting my face and it is helpful when I garden because it provides pretty good shade to my shoulders as well."
3.0,"My doctor recommended compression socks. These unfortunately were too tight from the beginning, hard to put on and to get off, and left my feet puffy. I’m slender, so my legs aren’t broad."
3.0,"This is a nice, super lightweight knit. Unfortunately it could not hold a candle to this CO cold, so I had to send it back, but could still recommend it for warmer climates."
3.0,"Sweater is Ok, a little thin. Runs small. I ordered a medium. I am 5'5 weight 118#. Hope it doesn't shrink"
3.0,Ordered red got orange<br />But other than that I love it!
3.0,"Nice but the laces are fake, these slip on and my grandchild pulls them off. After putting them on dozens of times, gave up on them. Get real laces."
3.0,"They are nice, but I didn't get 8 different colors. I got 4 and 4 clear. I am still think I want to send back since I really want 8 different colors."
3.0,"I think it is very cute (which is why I said it's ok).  It broke on me the 2nd time I wore it.  The wire on one came loose.  I fixed that, but then the clip broke.  It didn't cost enough to bother sending back.  Won't be buying these types of jewelry again.  You usually on get one or two wears."
3.0,It’s well made but much smaller than I thought it was going to be.
3.0,Tough to work with. Not so easy to put on and take off.
3.0,"I bought these Capri pants for travel nightwear.  Found they are significantly heavier than my cotton Capri pjs, so thank God, I didn’t take them to Europe with me. Biggest factor was that it takes two runs in the dryer to get dry. I had hoped to be able to hand wash and line dry so I’d only need one set of pjs on trips.  If I line dry these, it takes TWO DAYS! to dry whereas Everything Else is dry in one day.  They are great for workouts and strenuous chores, wicks well.  Also nice pjs at home; I just have to be sure to put them in the first wash load so they can dry in two loads."
3.0,It wasn’t what I imagined it to look like compared to the picture
3.0,Good looking but too small
3.0,This is darling- but not for curvy women.  If it had worked for my boobs It would’ve been a favorite. I loved how the built in bodysuit was and everything else about it.  But I couldn’t keep from falling out.
3.0,Broke on 5th wear
3.0,The material isn’t great and a bit scratchy for my grandson. It fit fine and I tried washing with a bit of fabric softener. Still kinda itchy.
3.0,They are stylish but they are not anti glare. I specifically wanted lenses that were anti glare (as advertised in the title) because the light from my computer reflecting on the lenses is distracting. As you can see the reflection of my phone in the photo. Real anti glare wouldn’t do that. Since I purchased for computer use it makes them pretty useless. I’m disappointed.
3.0,Very cute and soft. Very small but it looks cute with high waisted jeans. I ought the largest size and i am 5’6 130 lbs for reference
3.0,"Ok, actually this is SUPER cute, but I REALLY wish it came as an actual SET of earrings, and I wish I had ordered two, I completely did not read the product description, which is totally my bad, but who the heck sells ONE earring??? I could understand if it was a nose stud or a belly button stud, but come on!"
3.0,The top was a little big. But I am small chested. I would think a fuller chested woman would not have any problems.
3.0,"I should have read the description better. We need a watch that was water resistant and shock proof. This watch does not meet what we need , but the description is not misleading , we didn't read clear enough."
3.0,Tarnished at 2 months
3.0,"This suit is very cute, I love the colors. The top fits a little loose and the bottoms fit very small. I actually just wore some black bottoms with this top because the ones that came with it just would not work."
3.0,beautiful and good price good for kids 15 and under
3.0,I’m 5’6 and 146 pounds<br />I got a medium and it’s a little short. I usually always order a medium so I recommend to size up. It fits pretty snug on the waist. The only thing I had a issue with was when It got here it was very wrinkled and the zipper is cheap it broke off one side of the zipper after trying to zip it up a second time (I wasn’t wearing it either ) after a few sews and cuts I fixed it but disappointing. These pictures are after I ironed and fixed the zipper. Overall though the skirt is really cute .
3.0,"I purchase this for my daughter's birthday party, the kids really love it. It's really easy for them to wear it. The only concern is some lights are broken when we receive them and some last less than 10 mins. I think the quality is not good enough."
3.0,Very beautiful but unfortunately there was some rhinestones missing on the watch.
3.0,Color was vibrant and the length was perfect
3.0,Well made and sturdy but color is not quite red which is disappointing.
3.0,Clips too hard - damaging product
3.0,"No compression on the waistline. Maybe an extra small would’ve work better for my hour glass figure. I have big hips, thighs but small waist. I needed something to hug my stomach in also, due to having loose belly fat from pregnancies.<br /><br />Otherwise fabric is good"
3.0,"I was torn between keeping or returning this dress. I'm 5'4 165lbs and normally wear a large. But after reading reviews, I ordered a size up. The XL was a slight bit big on me I felt, but think if I went down to the large it might have been too snug. I chose to return it, I've been losing weight so it would only have gotten bigger on me, but the main reason for returning it was the length of the short side of the dress over the knee. It doesn't look too far above the knee in the picture, and I figured that since the model in the picture was most likely taller than I am, that it would maybe even be a bit longer than the picture. Nope! It was a good inch or two shorter on me. Not appropriate for the office, I probably wouldn't even wear it to a wedding. And the picture shows what looks to be modest cleavage but on me it was almost up to my collar bone. Not flattering. Overall, maybe on a different body type it might look okay, but I couldn't think of a single event that I could wear it to, so it had to go back."
3.0,"The dragonfly hangs at the bottom, face down, so you can't even see it when you wear these."
3.0,"I returned because I thought I ordered medium - I chose black and then medium, but medium was not available so automatically went to small."
3.0,"Adorable dress, form fitting, no fringes on the back of the black dress. It is kind of see through  so wear a slip or spanx to cover up. Over all for the price, not to bad"
3.0,For the price you get a lot but they break easily.
3.0,This dress fits great. Only bad thing it likes to ride up so have to keep pulling it down
3.0,"This bag is average for the price. It has a smell to the material and it attracts lint easily. As far as the structure of the bag I'd only expect to get a year or so out of it using it daily. On the plus side, it's light weight. It doesn't have an external mesh pocket for a water bottle. I don't think it would protect a laptop or tablet very well as there's not much padding."
3.0,"This is a very nice ring. When I first put it on it was not comfortable but after a little while I got used to it.  Now it isn’t bothersome at all. It is true to size. If I were to order this again I would order to silver,  not the two tone."
3.0,"nice shorts, but they are are between a size x-small and small"
3.0,"I don’t hate the dress, but it looks like a big sack on me. I’m pregnant, so I don’t mind wearing it as it’s still comfortable and the summers in SC are brutal. But if I was looking for a flattering summer dress...this would NOT be it. It’s small in the bodice and balloons everywhere else (great for a pregnant belly, just not ideal for top heavy women). I do like that it’s 100% cotton (slightly see-through, though) and made in India instead of China."
3.0,Nice with the automatic component. Bracelet attached perfect for styling
3.0,I suppose for the right size ears they will work.  I don't have big ears but they won't stay on so I haven't been able to use them.
3.0,The dress looks like a uniform more than a party dress. The color is a deep blue but the zipper can be tricky. The pleads in the front of the dress are not very flattering so you need a tummy control under garments. The v along the collar line was not very noticeable. I wore the dress once and that was it for the price.
3.0,Even with the misspelling my coworkers and I made a HUGE laugh about it because were that crazy. Great material spelling or not
3.0,Great purse but the wallet's already starting to come apart and it's missing rhinestones
3.0,These frames are a bit loose so if you child has a larger head they may work.
3.0,"Fits as expected but tends to stretch out and lose its shape over the course of the day. Good for layering, but the do not provide and support."
3.0,This jacket runs 2 or more sizes smaller than tagged. Looks to be made well just really small.
3.0,Made small ..... I  should have sized up I’m between an xl and a xxl depending on how some things are made so I got The xxl..... still too small !
3.0,"It is much thinner material than expected. I found that if you stretch it in light, it becomes a bit transparent. I could not get the ears to stand up for anything, so it looks quite sad and floppy. The material is soft and has a nice texture, but is more of a comfortable thing to wear rather than wearing it to combat the cold. The seam at the shoulders and armpit is quite tight, although it did get a tad bit looser as I wore it. It makes it a bit difficult to move your arms. All in all, not what I expected, but it is quite nice and I will be wearing it."
3.0,Couldn't make it small enough. 😐
3.0,"They are larger than they appear in pictures.  The central stone is faceted, so it looks cheap."
3.0,Love the style but the material is weird and thin. I'm still keeping it and probably wearing something underneath.
3.0,"My daughter loves them, but one was broken when it arrived, and one of the other tiaras broke shortly after. For the price I guess it's fair durability and since my daughter loves them I will probably buy them again."
3.0,"I am extremely pleased and can't believe I grabbed these for only nine dollars! Each earring is roughly the size of a quarter; not lightweight but not a pain either. The stoppers on the backs are a little loose, but if this becomes an issue you can use the posts/stoppers off another pair you already own, or buy a pack here for two or three dollars. These would be a good place to start: [[ASIN:B003B9BU60 Rubber Fish Hook Earring Safety Stopper for Post or Ear Wire Earrings (pack of 20)]] .<br /><br />No other complaints whatsoever!<br />-----<br />UPDATE: September 29, 2011<br /><br />I've taken my initial 5-star review down to 3. These earrings finally needed a cleaning that a damp cloth wouldn't take care of. I bought some silver jewelry cleaner, followed the instructions exactly, and the rear edges of both earrings turned pale pink. Two days later, fronts of both earrings are tarnished and have subtle pink undertones.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give these earrings one star is that they may be fine if you clean them with a cloth. I just wish care instructions had come with them indicating this was the case, or that the product description said ""silver plated"" instead of ""silver""."
3.0,"Both Masks wires broke within a day.  Not recommended at all.  Cheaply made.  Wire crimping was not done correctly on either one.  Broke twice... both times within a day.  Not seller's fault, just poor design.  Seller was great and offered a refund without me even going to them for it.  I can't, in good conscience, give a good rating for the product itself...but the seller and customer service is great!"
3.0,"Heart shaped, fun to wear. These glasses don't fit me the best and I've tried bend them to make them fit, but I can't seem to get it right. Good for the price and summer, but I don't wear them often."
3.0,"It was soft and light, u definitely need a slip or petticoat under."
3.0,"The dress is extra big and roomy, really too big, so order your correct size. Also the color is wayyy off. I ordered PINK. But the dress is PEACH!!!"
3.0,Ordered a size 16/18 fits my younger sons which is a size 12.
3.0,It was very nice for the price. But if your child can't be still for one sec. It will rip. my daughter did a lot of dancing at a wedding and it ripped. so this dress is good for one wear.
3.0,Nephew really likes them
3.0,"Runs small. Normal XL sweat pants on me are very roomy , maybe a tid bit too big. These though are very snug, not just in the waist, its tight in my thighs as well. i will say though, they are WARM! I wore these outside in 30 degree weather and even with wind blowing and my legs were nice and warm still."
3.0,"Great product. Only set back is that it doesn’t rotate like the movie version, the side buttons dont work. This should be specified on description."
3.0,The top is very snug compared to the bottoms. I sized up so hopefully the bottoms aren't to big
3.0,NOT MOONSTONE! I bought this because it’s listed as “moonstone” but it’s not even close. They’re glass beads. Pretty and seems sturdy (metal not plastic cord) but I can’t comment on longevity as I’ve only used it for one day of work so far. It hold my badge and work keys just fine.
3.0,"Goggles are good, the cap is not completely waterproof. Either that or is a little loose, hence my hair still got wet"
3.0,"The material for these are good, but the cut is weird for a toddler. The waist band fits well, but the legs are super wide. The more I wash them the worse they get. I keep using them because they breath well and my son likes the design, but since he's newly potty trained I fear that if he has an accidental that the underwear won't keep anything in if you catch my drift. All in all, I wouldn't recommend or buy them again but gave them 3 stars for the price and good quality of material."
3.0,"Cards easily fall from their slots when opened, need a quick release liner to keep in place"
3.0,looking for heavier feel
3.0,"Esta muy bien, solo del cuello esta algo reducido para la talla que encargué"
3.0,The fit was good but leggings are to thin for winter weather
3.0,"Color is NOT really Purple, but more a burgundy / deep pink color.  Very well made though and a nice bag overall, problem is that the ordered color is Not what it looks like on Amazon by description."
3.0,"Nice and warm,  but very tight.  I wear them to the dog park and have to take them off,  they cut off my circulation."
3.0,"Super cute shoes, thank God I looked at the reviews and sized up because a 6 would have definitely been uncomfortable. Even the 6 1/2 is borderline but manageable"
3.0,"The shirt is cute and fit well. I was very disappointed when I went on my first workout, wicks away absolutely zero sweat, the shirt becomes a dripping mess. I will not be able to use it for running or working out, only yoga or lying around."
3.0,The material was to thin to wear except in spring as a light jacket the fit was way to small. I returned it and had no problems with the return the company was very helpful and accommodating.
3.0,I purchased this shirt for six-year-old son who normally wears a youth medium T-shirt. The youth medium shirts are usually kind of big on him and this T-shirt fits more like a size small.<br />I would definitely buy a size up.
3.0,"M fits like a L or XL. Unless the wrong size was sent, because it doesn't have a tag..<br /><br />Would be cute if it fit, material is soft and only sleeves are ribbed."
3.0,"Works like a charm , a bit heavy but nice"
3.0,Does goos on time but it is difficult to change day of the week. It is easy to set the date.
3.0,These butterfly earrings are very thin and cheap looking.  They do not feel as if they will last long. I would have preferred a more solid looking and feeling pair.  I wanted a pair quickly to go with a butterfly shirt I own.  I wish I would have passed on these.
3.0,"My wrong not checking the size and content. Its a tiny bottle, and to expensive for what it is."
3.0,"I ordered a men's and lady's bracelet for y guy and I. We wear them everyday and really love the. The only issue is they come apart and fall off easily. Plus, the gold plate fades fast."
3.0,"When I first received this product, I was excited to give it a try. I’m always looking for something to add to the bedroom and with our upcoming wedding, I figured this might be a great idea for the night of the wedding. But upon closer inspection, I realized that it’s extremely poorly made. And by that, I mean I feel that they took scrap pieces of fabric and sewed it together on the bottom covering part that lays against the legs and splits up. The top half is pretty sound and flattering as well as fitting correctly. The lace design is classy and overall, it’s comfortable. However, the bottom portion is horribly cut. There are jagged edges. The sides are unevenly cut. There is a spot where it was cut into like the shape of a mountain. The seams are left exposed - they aren’t folded over and sewn to complete the design. Overall, it was a horrible cut. The bikini thong is in perfect condition. Not much fabric to it but what else do you expect ;) I gave this a 3 star review because though the bottom definitely has its flaws, the top is sewn correctly, the fit is correct in proportion to the sizing I bought and the length, and the thong is in perfect condition as well. I hope in the future the seller pays more attention to the cutting of the bottom pieces. I strongly felt like mine was sewn together with scrap pieces. Thanks!"
3.0,"Not terrible, just not great either. No stretch. Fit wise, I’m 5’6”, 165lbs, am 8/medium and have 34F’s. The large fit."
3.0,I have a very large chest so I ordered a large. Fits over my tatas. The straps are a little too stretchy so there is no support at all
3.0,Very cute earrings the only thing I dislike about them was they did not have earring backs! Ugh 😩
3.0,Runs big. 5’4 weight is 130 I got a medium and it swims on me. Size down!
3.0,"Fit as expected.  I didn’t care for the flaps and tie situation.  It also was 2 layers of material and I felt it would be too hot for vacation so I did send it back.  It is cute, my sister in law said I should keep it for later but I’m specifically on the hunt for cooler flows dresses to wear in the heat and this one is not it."
3.0,When It arrived it was bent and now nas a permanent wrinkle It does not fold like the picture.
3.0,"These are adorable on, but wearing them is like looking through a net."
3.0,average transaction
3.0,They was supposed to be for small wrists but they are not. But they will fit any other wrist
3.0,"The color was way lighter than I ordered,  didnt look like picture at all"
3.0,"Super cute, fits well and it’s comfy. But the material is kinda thin and a little see through. The straps also are falling apart after one wash."
3.0,Too big. Too long
3.0,"Very nice ring. Would have kept it had the sapphires not been so dark. At a distance, no one can tell what color stone it is."
3.0,feel a little bit small
3.0,Gave it to my nephew for Xmas quality was ok.
3.0,"ordered a large, too small."
3.0,It hasn't been cold enough yet to wear this coat but it looks like it will be warm.
3.0,"My wife loves the bottom (underwear), but the bra top is too big it kind of ruins the whole thing. The need way less material on the bra top and most of all selectable cup sizes."
3.0,"Wanted to love it, but it is too shiny and plastic looking for my taste. Functional, though."
3.0,Shrinks after one wash.
3.0,"Loved the fabric and fit of this tunic sweater but after a few washes, it looks old."
3.0,"love the color, but fit is very snug"
3.0,"So far I have been unable to connect my Mac lap top, my I pad or my I phone to it.  How does one charge the port on the suitcase itself?  Thanks.."
3.0,"The fabric is a little too light, but overall it's cute.  However, I would recommend a petticoat for underneath the skirt to poof it out a bit.  I bought a red one and it looks perfect!"
3.0,"Arrived with scratched lenses<br />If you're lucky enough to receive yours with no defects, they're a great pair of disposable shades. Break'em, loose'em, oh well who cares get another"
3.0,"cute, shorter than what picture shows and strings are very short used to tie."
3.0,"I ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but I should have ordered my exact size – I have too much room in the toe area. I'm debating on whether to exchange for the next size down, but want to test on a longer ride first."
3.0,"I ordered a medium belt and it was too large. The belt was fine other than the size. I reordered a small and when I went to put it on, the belt did not have any holes punched in it."
3.0,"Cute, but oversized"
3.0,"Definitely more of a light weight rather than a mid-weight sock, which is a little disappointing since I was hoping for socks to help keep my feet warmer. Maybe I should have expected that from a free-style sock. Haven't tested them out skiing yet, but they will likely have to be spring-ski socks for warmer weather. I do love the pattern and the slight mismatch between the two socks, so for that I'll keep them. Foot of the sock fit as expected, but if you have slightly larger calves, they are a bit tight. I don't expect to have any problems with them staying up though, and they have nice cushioning on the shin and heel. Also very soft."
3.0,"I loved the design of this shirt, but it did not fit my body well. I am pretty busty (34DDD), and found that the tank top gathered at the chest/neck and under the arms. I think this would fit better on a woman with a slim body/small bust, or someone who is consistently the same size on the top and bottom."
3.0,"I ordered a small, if you have a larger chest product doesn’t work well. I’m 5’2 and 140 pounds with 34DD. The shirt fits perfectly but the top is extremely small, it barely covered anything for me."
3.0,The material really turns this shirt into looking like a waiter's uniform. It's not like how it looks in the picture. It material looks really synthetic which adds to the waiter look.
3.0,Didn't notice anything great. Still a good conditioner. Mine came in these tubes.
3.0,"They are much more yellow than they appear online. The fabric seems cheap.  Hopefully, it won’t show under the flower girl dress"
3.0,"This jumpsuit is made of a very thin material that wrinkles very easily. It’s a fairly cheap-looking material (but at under $17, I suppose I got what I paid for). I was hoping for something a little more dressy, so this isn’t really suitable for the intent I ordered it for. However, if you are looking for a more casual jumpsuit, this might pass."
3.0,"ehh. very big, and thin."
3.0,I could have put a decal a Ricker on some sunglasses.
3.0,I had bought a XL and thought it was just a bit small. It seemed like the top of the back kind of rolled down so I bought a bigger size. The XL was too big but I decided to try the smaller size again... Wish me luck!
3.0,"In the picture it shows a rhinestone jewel for each eye.  There are none on the actual bracelet.  Disappointing.  Other than that I love it, but the picture is misleading."
3.0,The pearl was much bigger than I would have preferred. The chain and lock of the chain were also of very cheap quality. The pearl also doesn't stay in place and so it has the potential to get stuck in the lock if you are not careful.
3.0,Elastic strap makes it easy to put on and take off.  Durable and pretty. Fun face cover to wear for the COVID scare.
3.0,"Purchased these bags to paint on. They are made of a nice sturdy canvas. Love the yellow handles, but was disappointed to learn they weren't washable. The tag inside says ""promotional only."" Not sure I would purchase again."
3.0,Nice feel but a little larger then I expected. Since it is compression I thought it should have a tighter fit.
3.0,Pretty but the cup size was too small for a 34B.
3.0,Great shoe but very small.  For USA buyers buy 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,It is okay. I ordered the small because the other reviews said they ran big but they were more like child sized. It did not fit my face well and looked more like small harry potter glasses. I should have tried the medium. They were sturdy and the nose part was bendable to fit but they sizes had to be stretched to fit my head. :(
3.0,I bought for my 5 year old because she loves this show on the kids app. Too big but she loves it and wears it anyway.
3.0,"Suit fits well and is as described, but the seams are a little sloppy, which makes them not lay perfectly flat. I guess you get what you pay for, but otherwise this suit is great and can be worn for activities such as paddle boarding, snorkeling, kayaking without moving around and showing too much."
3.0,Bulky clasp. I removed the uncalibrated thermometer. I'll wear it when camping and such.
3.0,"I SO wanted this to work - quality was great and it would've fit great if I weren't so busty :( the cups aren't super supportive so it kind of smushes everything together. And the hole in the top expands quite a bit, so between the smushing and the hole up top, it looks like you have a second butt crack. If you're below a D cup (or don't kind the butt crack look) then it really is great. Otherwise, look elsewhere :("
3.0,Fits a little snug big rim
3.0,"Cute boot, seems to be the real thing. BUT, they are well over an entire size too big."
3.0,You will see in one photo I have pinched and area of sock... that is all empty space... so if you have thin ankles and wide toes this may work you you... but not a good fit for me...
3.0,"I love this swim suite but it's so so small. I usually wear a small but I couldn't even get it on so I returned it and got a large but it was also WAY to small. No, I'm not large. I'm in good shape bit this is made for very small people."
3.0,Beautiful sweater but very small. Order at least 1-2 sizes larger. Will have to return mine.
3.0,"I bought a medium because someone said they were about my size, was tight. I wear a 36D bra, and got the medium it was a bit tight and uncomfortable.<br />I got the large and I wish it sat on my ass but it like shows the bump. If your a curvy woman in your hips and butt idk if this will be for you<br /><br />5'4-5'5 135-140 lbs and size D boobs."
3.0,too small for my face other wise nice.
3.0,Good item but not what I needed.  Thank you.
3.0,Got a M but the top is a little tight across the bust. I'm 36c hope this helps
3.0,These look like a great product but they are huge! I got them for my 1 year old and they will definitely not fit her till she is probably close to 4-5 years old! I’m not returning g them because we will use them eventually and they are super cute! But definitely for older kids!
3.0,"If a huge fan of the questar flow. The model previous to this was one of the most comfy shoes I've tried. Got this shoe on sale for $21 so decided to try it out. It runs a little bigger in size than the previous model. Putting that aside, it is not very comfortable and fits kind of weird."
3.0,still brought it to make it small
3.0,"This brand had another style I liked even more because the other did not have the plastic stays.  I appreciate the value overall, and that they handle being washed in the washing machine.  I don't usually put them in the dryer, but they have been fine with occasional dryer time.  I do not like the plastic ""stays"" on the sides.  They don't stay flat, but rather bunch up, making the bra look bulky. It feels slightly uncomfortable.  However,  I do like the bra because the rest of it is fabric without wires and still holds its form well."
3.0,Not the quality item advertised.  Useable but middle of the road workmanship and materials.
3.0,Smaller than expected.  I’d have to lose 20 pounds to fit
3.0,"Fits well, as others said the creme color is a bit se though & thin material but it’s not bad. I wore for Halloween but I’d totally wear to a ren fest."
3.0,"The goggles are great, but the clasps don't last. I have 8 pair with various tints, and the clasps on 4 of those pair have broke. Am hoping the manufacturer will send me replacement clasps, but haven't received a response to my request yet."
3.0,"It’s ok, not a big fan. It’s only been two months and color started fading.  My wrist sweat more with this on and can become uncomfortable.  I had to throw it way and order a new one.  Suggest to pay extra for one that will last."
3.0,Nice looking watch. The clasp won't close so I'll have to take it to my local watch repair shop to get the clasp fixed.
3.0,"Fits fine, but began unraveling after only two wears. Wouldn't recommend as a daily wear"
3.0,the color was right this time
3.0,"Cheap in quality but fine for the price. I love the bottoms for coverage, but they do roll up when swimming. The top is HUGE. I ordered a small and the bottoms fit like a medium, and the top like an XL. I couldn't use the top at all. The print is really cute."
3.0,"I wanted to try a 'proof of concept' that flip up sunglasses will work on the golf course. On calm days it works fine. On windy days, the lens-frame connection is a bit too lightweight and the lenses are flipping around."
3.0,Very easy to put in.  Wish it was more closed to look more like a closed loop.
3.0,The fit of this is nothing like any of the photos. It's plenty big around but it's soooo short. Crop top is generous. More like unlined bralette
3.0,"Size differs from each manufacturer, difficult geting the right size."
3.0,"Nice design , but fit a little loose"
3.0,I love the look and utility of this watch. I've had SGW1000 for a number of years. My wife has been after me to get a new one. So I bought this one. Everything felt great until I started having stinging pain every now and then. I realized that the strap traps wrist hair. I must mention I don't have a lot of hair on my wrist. Much less than an avg guy. But this watch keeps hurting. I gave it around a week to see if it gets better. But it was a constant pain. I am so disappointed as I really like the watch. I could try another strap but I decided to return and and now buying another model to try.<br /><br />I didn't have it long enough to checkout other features. It looks really good! Rose with a thorn!
3.0,So these pants are pretty cool but the sizing is definitely off. A 44 waist fits like a 40 waist. I sent them back and received a refund without any issues.
3.0,The medium runs large
3.0,Fits cute. Really cute
3.0,My husband loves these but they already have a hole in them near the zipper...
3.0,Just what I needed.  The only thing is I think I might have been able to get a better price if I would have done a little more investigation.
3.0,Very thin and cheap. Not worth the money
3.0,The arm holes are too tight
3.0,Looks exactly like the picture. However the post on back is a little short. Not a good choice if you have thick ears.
3.0,"much smaller everywhere but the waist-the waist is huge, and does not stay up"
3.0,"See picture, hopefully will help understand what I am talking about. We had to make some adjustments!! We really like them overall but the ear strap is sewed to the back strap, that goes around your head.<br /> I must say not cool, not cool at all! It was pulling my ear down very uncomfortable. So we removed the stitches and sewed it where it would move freely. I shouldn’t have to buy something that has to alter but oh well I didn’t wanna send it back I like the design just that one part I did not!!!! We is my boyfriend and I, but he is the one who fixed the straps. I purchased them as a gift for him, for work."
3.0,"Cute comfy outfit, runs a little big though"
3.0,"I'm 5'4, 130 lbs. 36C The review said the dress runs small in size, so I bought L and it was still a little tight around the shoulder/bust area. The dress is definitely too short for me to wear without any leggings or shorts inside. The dress is very thin and it's see through so I don't like it because of that"
3.0,the top is too big i had to adjust the top but then the bottom part fits perfectly.
3.0,"I liked the jewelry, although they can ALWAYS  do  improvements in the packaging.<br />In the previous reviews that I read, there was a box provided to each ordered jewelry, NOT this one, it was placed on an ordinary black carton with a very ordinary plastic cover to go with it.<br />Packaging is important, so for us to patronized again your product, this is an area for improvement.<br />Thank you..."
3.0,"I WANT to love this wallet. I had been eyeing it for weeks and finally bought it. My problem is that the orientation of how it opens is not how I expected. If you are left handed it will be perfect! But if not, it is kind of annoying. Maybe it is just me, but the orientation of how it opens feels backwards. When I open it how it feels natural, it is upside down. I also love that it holds so many cards, but it doesn't close well if you utilize all the space, which is also very annoying. I like enough to keep it, but be warned."
3.0,Cute but looks a little cheat. Smaller than pictures show
3.0,Cute outfit. Material seems comfortable. The downside is its for “chubby” baby boy and the bow tie is loose compared to the collar.
3.0,They’re ok. The problem is they don’t fit well over my eye glasses.
3.0,"Very cute! Just an inexpensive, fun  watch to use. You can’t be very rough with it because the magnet won’t hold, but it serves it’s purpose. Worth the price because the time piece works :)"
3.0,After wearing for 4 hours or more it's uncomfortable.
3.0,zipper is not super strong
3.0,Material was thick
3.0,"The watch arrived very quickly, so props to the seller and quick shipping (4 days from Japan).  The movement has been extremely accurate and the watch itself is nice enough for a $326 watch.  I bought it for wear while my Omega Seamaster 300 is at the service center for several weeks getting a full service.  I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the bracelet and the hollow end links.  I bought a separate bracelet with solid endlinks from Strapcode, but it does not fit this new ""Ray III"".  I'm sure that others looking for a watch in this price range would agree that they would gladly pay an extra $40 to $50 for a quality bracelet with solid end links.  I absolutely cannot stand the squeaks and rattles that this cheap bracelet makes!"
3.0,It holds all my credit cars which is nice. The only bad thing is I order a black one and got a navy blue instead.
3.0,I ordered an XL which is my typical preferred size in top. The length is not nearly long enough and it is way too tight. I am busty and 5'7.
3.0,"I almost kept this, but the quality isn't the best and it reminds me of a church dress. It's pretty tho..."
3.0,The ordering size runs small the side strips cut it your skin very uncomfortable
3.0,Cute swimsuit. Terrible on me
3.0,Cute and well knitted but sizing is of off bc the hat is a bit small for my 4 YO.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:ab1b80b2180f8e07c871859942859a45]] Has yellow discoloring but I'm gonna dye it purple so
3.0,Fits small. For both the adult and the child. My 6 year couldn’t wear the 6-7 and she is always pretty true to age/size. I would definitely size up all around
3.0,Its a birthday present for my niece.
3.0,Extremely rough on the surface
3.0,I absolutely loved this watch band but I only wore it twice and one of the gems fell out. I kept wearing it and a week later one of the strands separated from the base. So disappointed !
3.0,"It fit fine but was not very flattering. The material was just okay but in felt like the top white part was too sheer. Also, it felt like I got a wedgie everytime I bent over. :("
3.0,"I ordered an XL. I'm 175 lbs 5'5&#34;, wear a 12-14 and am a C cup. The bottoms fit excellent but the top is too big. My goodies would be falling out the second I hoped in the pool. Quality seems good so not a bad buy for the price I just wish both pieces fit."
3.0,Comfort is alright. Not sure if I have the right size - will have to explore more......
3.0,Thick material. Size up one size. The white color is see through unless you wear nude undergarments. This is NOT high waisted! Returning because it is too small and not high-waisted like it is advertised.
3.0,"I bought this shirt in order to have something that I could easily nurse/pump in. It meets that goal very well. I ordered a large, since that was what the sizing chart recommended, but it is huge (I would normally order a medium). I don't mind since I just had a baby and it hides things. But the real problem is that when I use it for nursing, it gets stuck in my bra leading to multiple wardrobe malfunctions. Maybe wear a camisole under it."
3.0,"I ordered the black and grey version in 5X, and normally wear an XL or 2X in US sizes (5'3&#34;, 200lb). I was looking for a longer length zip-up jacket due to my large bust (32JJ, or 50&#34; at fullest point) since a larger bust tends to eat up vertical space in tops and leaves them feeling super short in the front.<br /><br />The fit for me is barely okay. On the good side, the sleeves are a good length though maybe a bit narrow in the bicep for me, and I can zip the jacket up alright. But... what's with the dual zippers? Like I get that the cross over of the fabric needed to be secured on the inside, but the interior zipper is identical in material and pull to the exterior one, and shows through the fabric since it runs along the right breast while the exterior zipper runs along the left. Morevoer, why does the interior zipper only go to about waist length and then stop? You literally have to zip both of these if you zip either of them, so the fashion-over-function-factor is strong with this jacket.<br /><br />The pockets are also really weirdly placed. Way off around my sides rather than sitting on the front. This is probably a relic of really poor pattern scaling, as someone who was narrower in profile but wider from the front would probably find them well placed. But for a pretty typical round-shaped person in this size range, my hands are resting basically on the small of my back with my hands in these pockets.<br /><br />Another indicator of poor pattern scaling is the neckhole, which is humongous in this size. I hate when stuff touches my neck, so the v-neck on this was actually one of the reasons I purchased. But in this size the plackets of this jacket cross pretty much at the bridge of my bra. If I wasn't wearing a shirt underneath, I'd call it inappropriately low cut for a super casual office setting in a progressive/liberal/nudity-legal part of the world. Put another way, the top of the zipper only goes to just below the fullest point of my bust, so... in cold weather this will need a few scarves, to say the least.<br /><br />I don't know if I'd recommend this jacket to other women - plus size women - similar in shape to myself (larger belly and bust, smaller hips and thighs). It's particularly straight cut through the upper half so I don't get a lot of waist definition from my bust and am a little bit compressed, which I'm used to. On the lower half though the pockets are right along the &#34;flare out&#34; for hip shaping, whereas the banded bottom sits right below my belly and on my narrow hips; this makes the pockets stick out funny and makes my hips appear &#34;lumpy&#34;, all while accentuating my front belly roll. Why? Because this sucker is LONG. The wide banded bottom hugs the underside of my butt cheeks.<br /><br />TL;DR: I was looking for a longer sweatshirt with a lower neckline, but the 5X size of this jacket has more than 5x the length and 5x the neck hole because of cheaply scaled patterns during manufacturing. Beware of funny pockets if you have narrow hips, a short waist, or more than just a little tummy chub."
3.0,"I had read the reviews about how long the dress was and was hopeful that it would fit. The skirt is plenty long, but the bodice is too short for a tall woman, I'm 5'10. Otherwise it seems like a good dress for the price."
3.0,"this is a mass produced hat that is made in china, the band is total crap and I removed it and replaces it with a real one. It was glued and sewed on, a bit of a hassle to remove but worth it.<br /><br />I bought this and the scala hat at the same time. Both of those hats were made in the same factory IMO, I say this due to both hats had the same band sewed and glued in the same places, along with tag markings.  This hat has a leather sweat band and a satin liner in it.<br /><br />I do like this hat it is it is classier looking than a ball cap or a skull cap."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" , wear a size 12- 14 and a 38D. I ordered the XL and it was tight on me. The lace on top is very soft and stretchy, but the satin part just felt like I needed more room to be comfortable. I like that it covered my arms since it's winter time but definitely need a wrap just in case it's cool inside since it's very airy.  I ended up returning it but think it is a very pretty dress and great for any fun party."
3.0,Glasses stetch and become loose after a few uses. For the money and the brand expected much better quality
3.0,Would have preferred a green cloth wristband.
3.0,"For a compression shirt, the material is way too thin.  I usually where a small, and  I could have used an extra small.  Three shirts for $21 though is a bargain."
3.0,"Coat was very beautiful, style and color but the size chart is too misleading I think because I ordered the size I wear and it was too snug especially in the area."
3.0,"Now my favorite glasses! Originally I thought they were bulkier than ideal, but I LOVE them!"
3.0,"You have to buy a size bigger. I am size 12, and these are just too tight."
3.0,works as a good gift idea
3.0,This is going to break quickly because the holes are to rip together into a larger hole.
3.0,"Maybe it would work for taller people? It was unnecessarily HUGE and I had a serious case of side-boob. Since I'm not Peter Griffin, I decided to send it back."
3.0,Color not bright and faded quickly.
3.0,"Color was lighter than I expected.  More bluish than violet/lavendar.  Flowy, yet clingy in stomach area.  I can pair with LLR leggings, but don't love the fit!"
3.0,"Lots of compliments.  However the winder  on the sides fell off of both of them.  Great look and idea, but a poor job on the mechanics.  Wish they would have lasted.😕"
3.0,"It fits well, but the colors are not very good. Its a great suit for the price and I will plan on wearing this when Im playing with the kids on the beach."
3.0,I purchased these for Halloween teal pumpkin treats. These are sturdy and colorful. I’m disappointed though that there are more seasonal prints than I had expected. Half of them are Christmas themed.  They were well packaged and inexpensive for the amount of trick or treaters we get but I’m not sure I want to give out any holiday things not related to the Halloween.
3.0,The cap depth is pretty short for th width of the band. It looks pretty awkward on.
3.0,"I love this bikini and thought it was gorgeous when I opened it, but it doesn't fit me in the slightest. My measurements: 34-28-40. I wear a 34b bra and small dress and size 8 jeans. My booty is usually the issue, but this time it was both. My top was extremely loose and couldn't be tightened with the straps without looking weird and my bottom was so tight I could barely breathe...."
3.0,"Nice, but too small for my taste."
3.0,They were okay
3.0,I liked the style.  My husband did too but the gun metal started<br />to wear off in about 2 weeks and has a black spot.  He is wearing the black one now.
3.0,Extremely tiny and difficult to work with!
3.0,"Moderate compression, I'm a distance runner, I loved the color (Pink) but the toe are was terrible. It was disproportionately large, this is not fun when you try to run, even walking you can feel the extra fabric against your skin. I was disappointing at the moment I opened the bag and noticed the toe area. Please fix this!<br />I don't leave negative feedback, but these socks are not good for runners."
3.0,Got it and one of the posts won't release.
3.0,"The product was ok, for the price. They are kinda on the small arms size but I was able to stretch it out a little without ripping them. The material isn't quite what I was expecting either. But they did give me the sexy look I was going after so I'm happy."
3.0,"Gem is dull very dull the color just isn't there, but perfect size and seems sturdy."
3.0,I like how they look but really haven't used them yet.
3.0,really cute ! everyone is complimenting me. BUT i had to wear hitop shoes because they’re kind of short. and i’m 5’2 120lbs
3.0,Fits ok. Poor quality for design. Looks cheap/blurry
3.0,"I loved this when I received it 2.5 months ago, great color so I can find it, love the 2 colors on the pull tags, fits both pairs of glasses, soft leather, but I can't give it more than 3 stars because just yesterday one of the hooks holding the pull tag totally broke off which makes it very difficult to open and close that side. Am guessing it is just a flaw in that hook because the other hook is holding fine. Unfortunately it's past the return window so I can't return it and I need one case for 2 glasses so I just ordered another double eyeglass holder (for $21 less) - wish I had ordered that one first."
3.0,"yes, this one was waaaay too long for me as I am 5'3&#34;."
3.0,"Feel ok, but makes this annoying squeaking sound."
3.0,"Unfortunately I received these a day too late. (had to cut nose ring out the night before) but I like these. They are quite small, so when I repierce it I won't have to worry about these sticking my septum. they are very cute too!"
3.0,"This product work best for skinny arms.<br />My upper arm is not that skinny so It wouldn't have looked as pretty as it looks.<br />But if it didn't fit the way you like it, you could always used it as a bracelet.<br /><br />When you get the product, the bracelet is not stretch out as shown in the picture. but it is stretchable to adjust you arm."
3.0,Feet slide out a bit. Runs a little small.
3.0,"Way to small. I am bigger in bust, I ordered a size up and I couldn't even get it buttoned!  I ordered a shirt similar in style and same size in  the Lee brand and it fit perfectly in bust and a little to lose everywhere else. I did love the style and material."
3.0,I loved the picture and there were no reviews so I took a chance.  I sent it back.  I was ok with it being a bit thinner then it looks but if you want the fit like the model you need to size up 1 or two sizes.  I wear l/xl and got xl and there was no extra room it just fit.  I was long but not baggy like the picture which I wanted for weekends.  I sent it back
3.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry., chains seem a bit short and you have to wear them higher than normal"
3.0,"Young LA stuff is great, this one though the waist band rides up above the waist, I was constantly pulling it down. I have bought some of the other sweatshirts and they fit better."
3.0,"Great looking and very comfortable, unfortunately not well made. As soon as I opened the package and saw the construction on top of the toe area I knew where these would fail but I thought they would last longer then a month. So sad to see so many poor manufacturers in retail."
3.0,The fabric actually feels really nice and its double layered. The colors seem pretty accurate as well. However the sizing is not consistent. All 3 of them are different sizes both in width and height.  Also the bow is GLUED on. For the price they are okay. Cute designs though.
3.0,"Item is very oddly made. For a 3x, it would fit a male with broad shoulders. . .not a 3x woman. Gave it away!  Disappointed."
3.0,"Bought this carrying case for my travel straightening iron.  The travel case is bigger than expected. A very nice case, just wish it would have been smaller to take up less room in travel bag."
3.0,"Its fine, just doesn't have the middle pocket like the 3rd picture shows. The back of the purse, the zipper is above the pocket instead of the side of it."
3.0,Well I like the set but the necklace arrived broken. I attempted to fix it but it didn't last. Other than that it is pretty.
3.0,It runs a bit small for the size. I bought an xl to be safe but around my boobs it was too tight
3.0,"Thin material and short arms for a 5 8&#34; medium build, but good for light rain and super cute!"
3.0,I washed before I wore and it started to fade immediately
3.0,"My son wore the jacket twice and not for very long either. Well the zipper broke off! And to top it off he was stuck in his jacket and I had to pull it off with the zipper still up and since it was smaller than expected for the size it was hard to get it past his head. I am very upset and don’t have the time to be returning it. I bought it thinking it’s a polo jacket it’s well made, well it seems like a knock off to me with the poor quality. DONT BUY.<br /><br />Well they refunded me my money without me asking, that was very nice of them. Thank you for that."
3.0,Its pretty but runs small
3.0,It’s a decent skirt but way too big. I ordered a medium which is my normal sizing and i had to pin it for it to fit properly.
3.0,I wanted this to be great. It’s thin and soft however the waist tie came damaged. I’m 5’3 and 135lbs and even the large was small.
3.0,Too tight up top
3.0,"Fabric okay, Design would be great if it was designed for a 5’ 10” woman and not made for a short Asian person.  Suppose to be a Tunic. No way."
3.0,Suit runs at least one size small for tall girls. My daughter is a women's medium 5'8&#34; 130lbs and she could barely get the medium suit on as it was too short in the body.  Suit seems great quality just runs small.
3.0,I was expecting a softer material. This one is a not as comfy feeling as others I've tried. It works though!
3.0,"I have ton of Nike baseball caps, much to my wife's annoyance. Of them all, my original plain blue featherlight is the favorite. Sadly, it has faded pretty badly, so I looked for a replacement. It looks like Nike no longer make the same model I bought before, but this seemed to be a good substitute. At least it bears the colors of Wycombe Wanderers, my local soccer team.<br />I like the cap, but the ""one size fits all"" isn't accurate. Mine does fit - barely, but the Velcro band is let out pretty much as far is it can go. My hat size is 7 3/8, so if you are similarly ""big headed"" you might want to choose another model. I have never had a sizing problem with my other Nike baseball caps, so perhaps this is a one-off for this item."
3.0,"The shoes are great, but I did return them since they are heavy because of the platform and there is not much support for your ankles. Wish I could wear them, but don't feel like rolling my ankle."
3.0,Disappointed. It was Too small to even try. This is only good for people who are already tiny and don't need this.
3.0,"A fan of Benyar. Always nice looking watches and reliable. This one arrived with a dead battery. :( But for what you'd pay for similar, not a bad bargain."
3.0,"They are comfortable -- they are NOT easy-on, easy off"
3.0,A decent pair of sunglasses.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my BF and he absolutely loved it! It broke within a month. But he loved it! If they could fix the sturdiness of it, it would be perfect!"
3.0,Too short..
3.0,Nice item. Little more rustic than I expected it to be though.
3.0,"I liked the design, but the main material is probably mainly nylon, not cotton as described."
3.0,Boxed well for gifting but the single wish is hard to see.
3.0,"Good design allows flexibility of use - with hood or without, poncho style to easily put on and take off.<br />The material was nice and thin and felt smooth against the skin but it was hard to wear in full sun because it lacked breathability - in spite of the openness of the arms. In all fairness, I'm not sure if it's any less breathable than other sun products.  It's good to wear when there is a slight breeze."
3.0,"These were alright, but I wasn't entirely pleased to discover that they hang at kind of a weird angle because of the way the wolves are shaped."
3.0,"I LOVE this dress, but unfortunately it's too big in the top.  Also, the lining in the back falls down, so it's hard to find a bra that would work."
3.0,"Not  a bad skirt, just that it has so much stretch that you need to down size/"
3.0,"Not exactly what I wanted. Very gold and cheep, but I got what I payed for."
3.0,These were composed of much thinner fabric than I had hoped.
3.0,"it was cute, but there was no stretch to it. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"looks like quality workmanship, just too small for the husband"
3.0,"The fit was good, but material was quite cheap and see through. Also quite short. Sadly was not right for the occasion I needed so I returned it. However, for the price not a bad little dress."
3.0,"The dye is not stable.  Some of it came off.  Also, the belt should really be labeled as shorter than advertised.  I put my ordered 42&#34; belt on a pair of 40&#34; jeans and could barely get it to go to the very first hole, when it easily should have gone to the middle hole (3rd hole).  Hoped for better."
3.0,"I haven't worn these yet, but plan to when I lose those last pounds.  This is more like a size small.  But there is quite a bit of supportive stretch to it that I can wear them.<br />The one time I tried them on the zipper pinched me.  I think having some underneath layer will be necessary because it did hurt. I believe I will like these once I've lost the extra weight."
3.0,It was pretty cute but not as nice as pictured.  Wasn’t as flattering on my bum as other dresses.
3.0,"Very cute and trendy but, as should be expected with the price, the metal is very cheap. Turned my ears lobes black pretty quickly."
3.0,If your new to stretching and stuff don't get them because they don't have the sizes written down and it Dosent even come with a pair of 6g it only has one earring and there are 3 earrings that are  4g
3.0,"This strap is OK. I does resemble the Omega strap and fit fine in my watch. I had an issue getting the pins in as the holes where small. The design of the strap is what made me return it. It didnt form to my wrist very well and where the strap meets the watch stood out causing a elevated looked to the strap. I put it on a 46mm Omega Planet Ocean ceramic and It was very handsom when not on my wrist. I had to return the strap because of the tight pins and odd look it had when worn. I have a 7&#34; wrist so not very large. Maybe if you had a 8&#34; wrist this would fit as the contored shape would form fit better.<br />Feel was decently smooth and soft, overall seemed to be good quality rubber."
3.0,It’s cute but the white embroidery is not tacked on very good.
3.0,Fabric is really heavy and pulls down the thin top.
3.0,Loved the lining. This is too short and too small. Very dissatisfied.
3.0,The tank was well made but was way too short especially in the front to work out in.
3.0,Beautiful dress fits somewhat small
3.0,"Nice enough, but about a foot too long"
3.0,The skirt is fine but the top is too big.
3.0,"Too small, if you need a big bag then this is not the one."
3.0,"He shorts are true to color and design, which is so springy! Unfortunately, these won’t be worn often, as despite the crotch and legs fitting well (and a bit loose, which is what I wanted) the elastic in the waist is very tight. It ruins these shorts for me."
3.0,"Tummy control band doesn't help my tummy, but it is comfortable."
3.0,"It isn't over sized, but it's still super cute and comfy"
3.0,"Didn't like how it the shape made my figure look. Also, material felt heavy."
3.0,"I wear a 20 and purchased a 2x based on reviews, but it was too small. I was able to pull it up way above my waist and make it work for what I needed. It’s a beautiful red color and is nice grab fabric.  Make sure to wash before wear. The red bled on my white leggings and shirt."
3.0,"Belt buckle fell off and apart after a few months, decent belt"
3.0,"Not at all like the picture. It's more of an actual tote bag with color to it. I like the bag itself, but I'm glad I got it for 20 bucks because it's not worth the 60 original."
3.0,"They coller was tighter than I expected. Was hoping it allow for a more ""off the shoulder"" look but it really doesn't. Cozy sweater though and great color. Probably wouldn't purchase again though."
3.0,"Unfortunately, doesn't work with a mask - or at least my mask. It works better after freshly cleaning but it's an arduous process to stop and clean glasses every time you mask up."
3.0,"I have ordered many pair of this particular pair of readers. I like the glare protection and crisp lens. However, this last pair came loose two days after the return option ended. I can't wear them in this condition."
3.0,Order a larger size than you need. Very pretty though
3.0,"The shoes are SUPER CUTE and my 3 year old daughter absolutely loves them. However, a couple hours after playing with them, the light pink shoes had its flower fall off. Not just fall off, but come apart completely. I can glue another flower on but it would have been nice to have them stay together longer than a couple hours. To be fair, the other shoes have been fine so far."
3.0,"Cheap, nose fell off first day."
3.0,"The feel is absolutely fabulous, and they are really beautiful, but they are a little tighter than I thought they should be for the range these fit. I am a size 16/18, so I figured there would be some additional give in these, but it's pretty limited even at my size. It's not cutting off circulation or anything, but it wasn't as stretchy as I would have liked."
3.0,I loved the bamboo wood but I didn't like the lenses at all! I see screens as purple colour. cheap lenses but I love the frame though.
3.0,The metal was a little rusty.  Had to sand it down to remove the rust. It is a great tool.
3.0,"It was a little below Amazon and my standards. I probably should have sent back but leaving town for wedding at the time. Material reminds me of thicker sheet. At least you can’t see through. Haven’t worn, but seemed like it washed up ok. I was hoping it would come out a bit softer,"
3.0,Writing is a bit too high up on head.
3.0,This wasn't for the person.  The clasp is difficult to close because it's small.  The wing won't stay upright.  not what the person wanted.
3.0,"Fit great and is very heavy! The wool is itchy, but holds a nice shape"
3.0,"Nice design, but flawed stitching. Makes the cap look lopsided due to stitching error."
3.0,"Cute simple pair of earrings. They’re a little cheap.  Good for every day use, but not really formal wear.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- rose gold is pretty. And so is the opal<br />- it’s simple, can wear it daily<br /><br />Cons:<br />- it’s cheap.  The description sets the expectation though (don’t wear while spraying hair spray or taking a shower, etc.)<br />- opal isn’t too sparkly"
3.0,The sleeves were very tight so I had to cut them along the seam and restitch them. Otherwise I thought the costume was fine. I ordered too close to Halloween to return the product but managed to make do.
3.0,These are okay.  They darken but  do not seem to brighten anything.
3.0,I don't think the top will hold up.  Very thin will always be wrinkled
3.0,Was my daughters size but somehow they ran a bit too small
3.0,looks sporty under a see through gym shirt and I like that aspect however I wouldn't go for a run in it. I wouldn't consider it high impact for my 40 C.
3.0,A little to small .
3.0,Small but handy travel purse
3.0,"The glasses case is well made and will hold two smaller sized pairs of glasses, it will not hold a pair of sunglasses and another pair of glasses.  The latter is the reason I gave three stars- my intended use was for regular and sunglasses in one place.  The pattern is as shown."
3.0,"i returned, way too large"
3.0,Love the look. Cant wear it for long periods of time though bcuz the ends mark ur lip...making it sore. I sore mine from early afternoon until late evening.
3.0,I mean I'll keep it a bit translucent but can wear with a cute bra.
3.0,"The only ring out of the bunch that actually does anything is the multiple ring one. The others don't spin freely, feels like something is grinding and stopping them from spinning. They are definitely cute."
3.0,I usually don’t leave any review but I wanted to mention that even though it didn’t work out for me in the end the seller had constant communication and feedback and took care of the problem like a professional.<br /><br />I purchased a small and had a hard pulling it over my hips. I think if you’re not 100lbs and around 5-5”1-2 it won’t fit
3.0,[[VIDEOID:1f705fdb29415b90aa62062b970cde25]] Nice outfit but a little big in the torso area
3.0,I will be returning it due to size was way to small ...
3.0,"it's a weird fit for me.  they are so cute and soft, but i prefer a slip on slipper, these you pull on."
3.0,Too short for the average person. This is better suited for a petite torso. It also shrunk after one wash.<br />I'm 5ft 7ins
3.0,"Although a nice watch, the band is way too small for even a petite female. It probably will fit a child or teenager, however, not an adult's wrist."
3.0,"broke pretty fast, but a nice design"
3.0,Very flat and one-dimensional. Would not buy again.
3.0,Love the way it fits my hips. Just a bit small. I recommend ordering a size up or two for a better fit. I like mine to fit right with my curves so next time one size up. Everyone loved it!
3.0,Doesn't fit right. Feels like it's to small. My glasses still get fogged up when using it.
3.0,"Keep in mind that the 2.5&#34; size if very large.  Think Elton John 1970's size.  That might be okay if you're planning to use these on stage, but they probably are not going to look right day-to-day. 2017.  Even the 2.25&#34; is probably too large.  And the bridge size of the 1.8&#34; version might be a little too small for many heads since it results in a PD that is pretty low.  -- The glasses themselves are pretty good though.  -- A brown version would be more to my liking though."
3.0,My scale didn't come with the complementary battery.  After buying a battery (half the price of the scale.... ugh) the scale works great!
3.0,This is nice.... Harvey but it looks nice.
3.0,Love love love this. Great  looking Accessory and very useful.  Would’ve given five stars if it had come with extra magnet backs.  After only a week of use the back fell off  and was lost.
3.0,"Fast shipping ' but actually smaller than I expected,"
3.0,"This is a nice well0made swimsuit. I am a plus size woman and ordered a size larger than I normally wear, it fits but is still too tight for comfort."
3.0,"The picture shows tinted visors, but they are actually reflective.  In the picture you can definitely see through them from the front side, but the actual ones are mirrored so you cannot see through them from the front, only the back.  I needed tinted, not mirrored."
3.0,"Cute but I tried to order as big of a size as I thought I needed to and it's pretty tight still, can't really wear it. :/"
3.0,Too much going on for my taste. Eh .. its ok.
3.0,They are nice but I should have offered one size up.
3.0,"It is lovely and nicely crafted. From previous reviews, I knew it was a large scarf and not a shawl but the picture is a little deceiving around the neckline. That would be my only negative."
3.0,The quality of the product is good but it does run smaller than the other 2 the XXL size was still to tight for me and the skirt felt more a medium size than a XXL size the top barely fits and the skirt didn't zip all the way. If your of the bigger chest size getting the I don't suggest this. I also purchased the Male version and that runs larger by alot.
3.0,"Not sure if it is me or the dress.  I am 57 years old and expected this to look better on me.  I usually wear a size 6-8 in pants/dresses.  I have a small to medium frame and I am in fairly good shape-exercise regularly/eat right, etc.  I ordered a small and it rides a bit high on my waist-sets right up under my bustline.  Not worth returning for cost so I plan on just keeping it."
3.0,I would give it more stars but because the chain is way off on the color than the charm. The chain is not what it looks like in the pictures they provide. The charm is nice and heavy though. Overall the charm is nice and big
3.0,"The legs on these pants were much wider than I expected.  Outside of the wide legs, they were a nice pair of pants."
3.0,This was for my wife.  I like the way it looks but my wife doesn't really like it.  In time she may change her mind.
3.0,"Not what I expected. The tights fit well and of course have the Luna look like the picture, but it had some extra stuff above the ankle (a crescent moon with the two cats sitting on it, a little smaller than a tennis ball in size) on both legs. It was a pain to scrape them off, thankfully the tights didn't rip."
3.0,"Seems like a good quality shirt and print, but it is made with a THICK, stretchy material that absolutely CLINGS to your body. I would say go 2-3 sizes up if you can when ordering. Not flattering in the least if you ordered your original size. Otherwise, nice quality shirt?!?! lol"
3.0,"It's exactly what I want from a pair of shades- cheap, decently made, and some personality.<br /><br />UPDATE: after the second pair broke after a month, I'm removing stars. The joints/pivots are very brittle and break easily."
3.0,Well the picture shows two framed signs. This is not the case. There is no frame it is just posters. I thought it was one framed picture. You will receive a tube with two rolled up posters.
3.0,Cute dress on the model not so much in real life. Cheap material and too large. Almost a tee shirt material. Returned
3.0,I would order a size up as these fit really tight. I am an XL in rebook and got a 2XL and they are very tight
3.0,"It looks good but it's pretty short, probably designed for a narrow tie. It doesn't hold to a shirt well either but I serves the purpose. Longer and stronger spring would make it 5 stars."
3.0,Does not really rest on the bridge of the nose. This is definitely costume gear. Any movement of the head will cause it to slip off.
3.0,"length is great, waist comfort is fine, with only issue in crotch area is being way too tight. with prolonged use causing chafing & rash"
3.0,"I don't like this one as much as my other Olive and pique hat, this one is taller. Otherwise it is ok."
3.0,This is cute and works pretty well at holding scent but the chain broke in very short order so it's now unwearable unless I have it repaired.
3.0,Nice and soft and stretchy BUT if you have a bigger butt or belly it eats up the length quick. So now it's very very short
3.0,"I actually tried to stop this order because it felt sneaky. I was looking for Oofos and this was placed in the search. When I figured it out it was too late to cancel.  They seem fine. A bit tight, but will probably stretch somewhat. The length seems a bit long.  If I could have canceled I would have, though these aren't what I wanted, I'll keep them because I don't want to have to spend money to return."
3.0,Too big for me but fits my husband perfectly. I’m a normal sized woman with a normal sized face.
3.0,"Cute enough, but runs small"
3.0,"I didn't know how small the product was going to be, doesn't fit my face at all, feels like it's for a child. It still looks cool though just won't be using it for what I had in mind."
3.0,I like the fit.  The grips are fantastic!  I wear slipper socks all the time and these have the best grip on a floor I've ever experienced.  My only hesitation is that they are very delicate.  I wash them on gentle and they are still starting to get holes (I ordered them around XMas and its been 2 months).
3.0,My son did not get to use it so I can’t comment on how well it held up but it looked like it was constructed pretty well. We had to size down because it was way too big.
3.0,"The quality is not good. However, it is a costume and I am wearing once - so it will work"
3.0,"This pack of underwear arrived nicely rolled up and in a clear plastic case. They are decent quality with an extra nice waist band. Not being tagless, there is an annoying tag to remove. I thought the legs were usually short but not uncomfortable to wear. The fabric seems of decent quality as does the workmanship.<br /><br />For me, the problem is the sizing. I have been wearing an XL for many years. Even though the tags say XL, they are more like a large, but just barely a large and are simply too small for me."
3.0,Fits a little strange and material feels a little cheap.  Worked for a costume.
3.0,"Good looking belt, but ratchet doesn't stay locked. I bought this belt to replace one I have had for over a year. My old belt was flawless, just a little dull on the leather....may go back to it."
3.0,"This is better than any others that I’ve found but the sizing is still not right. It fits better than the others I’ve tried, enough so that my watch can detect most things, but it’s still too loose especially if I’m moving my arms at all, which is always. It’s not even stretched out by my wrist and my wrists aren’t THAT small. I was hoping for a snug fit, this is just passable for me."
3.0,"Extremely thin, item stretches out throughout the day and you have to dry it to shrink it back into shape. Not the best quality but for the price it’s a ok deal."
3.0,runs small and colors faded when washed.  like the material.
3.0,Figure as many also stated is not of good quality to see. Many people as well as myself cannot actually make out what it is.
3.0,"The matetial is thin, but worth it for the price. I do like it. Its definitely for the summer time."
3.0,"I did not like it, it was to small for me<br />It look good."
3.0,"I like the material, didn't look see thro but it rolls under the gut and wont stay in place im 5'2 lb175 and got the large. Dont know if I got it too small but everything else is ok its juat the rolling under the gut that i dont like<br />Also in the image the model has the pants higher on the waist, for me they barley went over the belly button and in short<br /><br />I personally think<br />Fengbay High Waist Yoga Pants, Pocket Yoga Pants Tummy Control Workout Running 4 Way Stretch Yoga Leggings<br />Are better, they roll down less"
3.0,I'm too chubby for this dress but it looks good on my tall thin sister.
3.0,I probably should have purchased a more expensive shoe. I don't think this shoe will last very long.
3.0,I gave it to my roommate she like it with sign ily.
3.0,Works & fits good. Would give it 5 stars but the print isn’t very clear
3.0,"Dress style nice, material not so much"
3.0,"Size was good and it was super cute for the price, but it could use some more snaps in the legs.  The large gaps between the leg snaps left big open gaps which could have easily been fixed by adding a few more snaps in between."
3.0,I bought these for postpartum to help with the tummy situation... They are a liiiittle too tight a week after baby so I'll be waiting 2 or 3 more weeks to try them again!
3.0,Cute pattern great for light wear unfortunately I think it’s slightly flimsy and the bill is to thin. My daughter keeps her things neat and nice but this only held up for a few wears until I deemed it a play hat for backyard use only.
3.0,Great product...well made
3.0,"If you order this knowing that you are only going to get a few uses out of it, you will be happy with  your order.  If you have a gut, order it larger."
3.0,"I love the color and the crisscross front. But this runs small and is very thin material. I like a top loose fitting. This one is way to clingy for me. Doesn't hang well, that maybe because of the thin material."
3.0,Quality is good but they are way too big for my 5 year old. These are adult sizes. Even a little big on me.
3.0,They run about one size to small and a strap broke in a week. Otherwise they felt really cushy
3.0,Came with lines in the print.
3.0,"I ordered a large because to fit in the bust. So usually there is plenty of room in the rest, but this ran small. It fits ok but not real lose. I haven't washed it yet, but I think I may need to hand wash. The material seems a bit fragile."
3.0,"This sweatshirt is thin, and more of a synthetic fabric than I was expecting. The colors are vibrant, the printing is centered and clear.<br />It runs very small, though. I normally wear an XL/2x and ordered as the chart advised, but I can't even get it on. The shirt fits my eleven year old daughter well though - she gets compliments on it all the time."
3.0,slightly larger than I thought. The color strap started coming apart tge 1st day. Quality not that great.
3.0,"Felt more like plastic, live the detail. Wish it would of came with a tool to fill vials. Overpriced and a long time to ship."
3.0,"I was expected better quality. Bit i think that for the price its just ok. The earmuffs do not adjust so be aware, and they are a little uncomfortable because after 30 minutoa or so they slide from your ears, so you need to keep adjusting them"
3.0,"Es de peso muy ligero.<br />En cuanto a comodidad únicamente lo utilizaría en casa y por momentos por cuidado de la Luz azul (tv, computadora, teléfono).<br />En cuanto a calidad no lo recomiendo para personas que quieran usarlo permanente, tampoco para agregar fórmula para leer o ver mejor."
3.0,My foot. 7aa.  7 Sperry. Seems a bit too tight...  99% of the  the time find shoes too loose.....
3.0,It runs a little small.  But it's sooooo pretty
3.0,"I like the shirt. Fit to size, looks good. It not High quality linen material. But for the price it’s fair.  I was expecting a higher quality, but realized, what I paid and I shouldn’t complain."
3.0,Very yellow tinge to it.
3.0,They did not fit well. They slip down your calf
3.0,It’s good no wash label?
3.0,"The bust area is not as shown if you have a larger bust. The waist on me was right below my bust and more of an empire cut. It will be fine with a belt, but was hoping for a longer more flattering waistline."
3.0,its fine its still cool
3.0,Extremely cheap material all around the neck and all edges sting the skin
3.0,These are so SMALL.But they are Cute.
3.0,So cute and the size was perfect but I did have some issues with them sliding off of my ear lobe.
3.0,"So I've been working out in this top for about a month, and I really wished that they had build some cups into this top! I like the top, but I still have to wear a sports bra (I'm a 38D cup) to get the support that I need. I liked it initially because I can wear my high waisted leggings and it would match most stuff. I also liked the back opening because I get hot quickly. but because I have to wear a sports bra, I still end up covered. If you are smaller on top, this top will definitely be a benefit for you."
3.0,A bit higher side for the price.
3.0,The holes on either side of the silver part are hard to get on and off. Sits funny on my wrist also. Looks pretty and the picture is accurate.
3.0,my only real problem was the clasp-it was too small to handle
3.0,Top is great. Bottom is much bigger and the buttons &#34;hang&#34; funny. But my granddaughter loves it and so does her Mom and everyone else who sees her in it...
3.0,Nice watch looks good but very small watch altogether more like a lady's watch.
3.0,Fit is great but i hate the fabric. Its lime a stripper polyester not a nice cotton. Shiny like latex almost.
3.0,Now I gotta find a full body slip to wear with just this dress 😕
3.0,Not antique in appearance as I expected
3.0,"These are very cute but they barely shade your eyes from the sun. If anything, the mirror effect makes the sunlight even brighter. Really defeats the whole purpose of sunglasses.."
3.0,Too large. Hard to get out of back pocket.
3.0,"Very cute, but runs large. I had to get it taken in on the sides."
3.0,The side pieces that goes to your mouth wont stay in the proper shape.  Ended up Hot Gluing some wire to the inside so they would keep shape.  Overall it looks ok.  The Forehead strap feels a little uncomfortable like its cutting into my forehead but really its not terrible.<br /><br />Just 1 size no adjusting.  So hope if fits ya.
3.0,"Fit fine in through my tongue but added a lot of pressure to my tongue top to bottom. Pinched pretty bad, ended up just taking it out until I got home. Left pretty good marks on my tongue. But the half disk balls are good for me to repurpose on a different stem."
3.0,Not authentic but doable. The real jersey is adidas. There was some kooy tag I have no idea what it is. Still keeping it because his real authentic real madrid jersey they dont make anymore
3.0,"When I first received my sunglasses, I was really excited to try them on as it was a replacement to another pair of sunglasses that broke and it was similar in design but fraction of the price but as soon as I opened to package, it stuck!  I mean the stinch really strong that even though I aired it out for several days it wouldn't go away until a month later.  I finally where it on a daily bases but what is this made out of that makes it smell sooo bad???"
3.0,"Very short and tight, especially in the back. Not flattering on me."
3.0,Not quite as snug as I like my workout pants to be
3.0,"Super thin.  I almost forgot that they actually can make chains this fine.  It's really thin.  Doesn't work for my pendants as they are too heavy, but if you have a delicate something or other it might be perfect.  You can't beat the price, so it's worth a shot."
3.0,This is a lot shorter than I expected. I am 5'1&#34; and it comes mid thigh. I will be giving to a younger person.
3.0,It's very pretty but the chain on it is kinda cheap. Other than that pretty
3.0,This was a nice basic top to complement some trousers I purchased. It’s a good buy for the price.  The material is a smooth spandex like feel.
3.0,"Grade: B<br /><br />I really wanted a pair of Pureboost for a while and when I found they made a skate shoe, I had to get it. Had high expectations for Adidas but these fell short in both appearance and quality.<br /><br />The Boost aspect is super comfortable and provides a serious kick to your step. The material both looks and feels like a sock and holds tight to your foot with each step. The problem lies with the construction of the sole of the shoe. It took one miss step kicking a curb and the grey tread in the front peeled right off exposing white underneath. This is very apparent now when you look at the shoe. There's no way these would hold up skateboarding whatsoever.<br /><br />TLDR: Attractive shoes with a comfortable step but won't last for daily use or skating."
3.0,Cute but cheap looking. Good for the price.
3.0,I should have ordered two sizes up! It runs small
3.0,Love the beads but it broke the first time I tried to put it on
3.0,"A little big but not to bad , quality of material seems lacking though. The white thread on the inside pulls through the red side for no reason. Not real happy"
3.0,They are way smaller than I thought. Only one pair would fit my ears
3.0,They're pretty but thvery snall.  I have 7 inch wrists and they're tight.
3.0,"Two pins did not come as expected . However, Bangood dealt with this problem excellently."
3.0,"I normally wear a size large in shorts like this.  I had to return the large and get an extra-large however, it is still a little tight.  They are very cute and the material is soft but make sure you order at least 1 size up, maybe 2."
3.0,The upper part of the back we very uncomfortable. Around the chest rolled.
3.0,"The picture doesn't show it, but there is peachy tones in the bracelet."
3.0,"These slippers aren't nearly as sturdy as they appear in pictures. They're warm, soft & comfy but they won't last long ~ & after only two weeks I'm feeling the fluffy foot-bed wimp out & start to bunch up. Someone asked if the turned-down ankle cuff can be turned up; the answer is that the back cuff can be turned up against your ankle, but the front is tacked down & won't turn up. Last, I chose my size carefully & they fit beautifully at first. But in two weeks they've stretched & flopped to the point that they're far too large & I have to wear big socks (or give them to my husband). Keep this in mind & maybe get a size smaller than you think you need."
3.0,"I ordered my size, but it was too big and looked frumpy when I put it on."
3.0,"These earrings are pretty but they're not quite as pictured.<br /><br />First, there's less density of the little crystals than the pictures show - in real life, there're more gaps between the crystals and fewer than are shown in the earrings in the pictures.<br /><br />But the biggest issue for me is that about 1/3 of the crystals have that iridescent coating that makes the crystals look all rainbow-y when the light hits them - definitely not as shown in the pictures. This makes them look a lot cheaper than they otherwise would. I'm not returning them bc it's not worth it for the cost but I won't be wearing them for the event I had planned."
3.0,"I think that this company is now offering a &#34;busty&#34; sizing for their bras, which probably would have worked better for my double XL, but I have been satisfied with the softness of this product and continue to use despite some escaping/squishing out of my breasts....."
3.0,"Pretty dress, pattern is bright but not over powering. I have it 3 stars because (1) the size was off and (2) it is extremely short.<br /><br />If your goal is comfortable and carefree, unless you are about 5’5, 5’6, your butt will be out. Not even boyshorts would make it “safe” for someone of my 5’9 height. As to the size, I ordered a large and although it went on, I couldn’t zip it.<br /><br />Again cute dress."
3.0,"I love everything about this vest other than the fact that the LEDs are too bright. You wouldn’t think that would be a problem for a visibility product, but the top bulbs shine almost directly into my eyes and it is very unpleasant. Short of covering them with electrical tape (a short-term solution), I don’t know how to fix it."
3.0,"Lightweight Gen I ECWCS jacket.  Fits somewhat smaller than expected.  Waterproof.  Nylon lining but it provides no real insulation.  Decent pseudo-multicam-style camouflage pattern.  OK raincoat that can be packed in a fairly small space.  Plan to use it for camping, hiking and commuting.  The relatively low price is the best thing about this, but you won't look stupid wearing it, so long as it fits -- if you usually wear a Large, this X-Large should be fine; if you usually wear an X-Large, this will fit but you probably won't be able to layer much beneath it.  Good velcro on the cuffs, allowing secure closure."
3.0,Not very well made but for what I needed...........they worked great.
3.0,"When I first saw this colorful necklace I thought that's it!! That's what I've been looking for in a statement necklace and anticipated it's arrival, When I opened the box it was dazzling, however very overwhelming, it is very large and very heavy, hence I had to return. Some words like gaudy ostentatious, and garish also came to mind but I won't go there, I can't pull it off but I am sure some ladies with a certain type of flair could do it and get away with it. Not for me, but I will miss the beautiful colors."
3.0,"I got this dress because I loved the style but it does run small. I wear a 16 top and an 18/20 bottom and I got it &#34;on&#34; but couldn't even get the corset cover piece to cover one side to the other. SO, with that said, unless you are smaller busted I wouldn't recommend this."
3.0,Too small for me but good came on time
3.0,Like all belly button rings. cheap quality. was cute for about a few weeks and then the top part you screw on got out of line with the bottom jewel. hard to explain but save your money.
3.0,"The necklace is very pretty.  The color of the topaz is lighter than I expected and the setting is a little underwhelming.  The value is good, though."
3.0,"I purchased because it said it was wide at 60&#34; but in fact is only 56&#34;. Too thin and see through  for the curtains I intended it for, but over all  is nice , pretty fabric"
3.0,"This shirt is cute, but definitely smaller than it appears and much shorter. I'll still wear it, but I wouldn't have bought it if I were to try it on at the store."
3.0,Not snug enough but you do sweat
3.0,nicely made earrings. however they are advertised as clip on earrings and they are regular earrings. Take note before purchasing.
3.0,Too thin of materials requires thermals to be warn if you don't want to be out in your underwear.
3.0,These fit great in the length. But the toe area is way too wide. Wish that they would make some narrow sizes.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this tshirt.  I got the sloth running team.  I always wear a xl top unless it is Asian size.  I am 55, carry my weight in my stomach and hips, 145 lbs.  This shirt is disappointing.  The top fits strange in the shoulders and arms, is tight in the stomach, and the picture on the front is huge."
3.0,Super short! If you’re over 5ft 6” you’ll struggle
3.0,had to buy a very flat screwdriver just to change the bands back and forth..a little annoying
3.0,Sizes are way smaller than what they are online. I really needed this product to fit to for work.
3.0,"I just love everything ""almost"" everything about these belts. The colors are vibrant. The size is perfect. I love the way they latch by interlocking in the front. Stylish look. The only complaint is they are slightly flimsy. Well, not slightly, they are very cheaply made... as in dollar store type material. But...they are really cute. I don't expect them to hold up for a long time. For the price they should be made out of better material."
3.0,after having a few months the blue tint is coming off the lens is very delicate. however I am disappointed in the blue tint coming off. other than that one complaint they're nice glasses and I get lots of compliments.
3.0,These don't go down as far on your foot as the picture shows. It really just covered the very top by your toes.
3.0,"The material seems like very good quality. The 3 stars is more for description, there's no adjustable band inside like it says."
3.0,Product is fine but the $1.59 price tag attached to the cover clearly indicates I was grossly overcharged.
3.0,"Meh. The color and design is nice, but on my 5'7&#34;, 138 lb. frame, it just makes me look kind of dumpy. I think it might work for really willowy, tall, thin women."
3.0,The arms of the dress just wouldn't fit. Also after cutting them off I tried wearing the dress 1ce and it wouldn't stop sliding up ma bum had to go back home and take it off.
3.0,I used it to reshape my hats. The result wasn’t that I expected.
3.0,One belt was fine correct size (black) the other was small I need to return it after the holidays.
3.0,"Necklace is very pretty. The chain is a little thick for the size of the cross in my opinion. Also the chain does not have a loop on the end to put the hook into to clasp it, so it basically hooks into a chain link. It is a little hard to hook. Also the edges are sharp and a little rough. If you have a cleavage it tends to get caught there and the sharp edges are uncomfortable. Hopefully, if I wear it more, it will smooth out some. But for the price, it is a nice looking necklace and I don't regret buying it nor would I want to return it."
3.0,Nice dress loved the color and the cut but was too big.
3.0,skinnier than I thought they'd be after washing
3.0,LOVED this bag but the straps and shape of the bag were awkward. The straps were great as a backpack but when used as a crossbody the bag was just to large and the strap was in a weird position. It wasn’t as functional as I would have hoped. Awesome bag just not for my daily needs.
3.0,Disappointed in the lining. It is cheap crinkling material. other wise it looks great.
3.0,this is AMAZING thick material. i usally wear a large. in womens and a medium in mens. i got this in the mail tofay and was surpised at the quality. it is very nice. i know the wasit tranior is suppoed to be tight but this is a little TOO tight. it squeezes me. i would defnitly order a size up. but i guess im going to be even skinner now hahah
3.0,It's pretty and low key. Had to stretch it pretty open to fit my hole but it was worth it.
3.0,It is not what it appears in the picture the stone was way too flat. in the picture the stone side shave with corners not buried flat
3.0,"Have not had a chance to wear it yet, but it appears to be well made. I probably will order another one."
3.0,"This a cute dress, but the sizing runs small. I am returning it."
3.0,This ring is beautiful but it is too small if you order order a ring size bigger than your normal size.
3.0,I ordered 2/3T for my 3 yr old. It's small. I'd say it's really 2T. I really liked it though
3.0,"Wish it had been a little larger. Was only slightly larger than a quarter, so I'm glad it was for a teen with better vision! :D"
3.0,"Large keys were the size I was expecting small size to be. Small ones much much smaller than I thought they would be. I order these to put up on a Harry Potter themed Christmas tree (and not a large one at that) but the small ones are so small there wasn’t any point trying to put those up. The other ones are extremely hard to see.<br />A lot of the Wings came bent at odd angles too.<br />Moral of the story is you get what you pay for, and these were the cheapest I found."
3.0,"I was so happy after the first application; then after it dried it had a little give so I I applied mor and it felt pretty solid. I wore my hat to church and by the end of the day, one side was snooping. Yes it does work but not that well. I’m still looking for something with endurance."
3.0,"The craftmanship is good.  Just as pictured, however the ring was a bit large. I had ordered a size 7  for my ring finger. The ring kept moving around, which made it a bit annoying. I was expecting the ring to be a bit heavier then it was. However for the price, once again, you get what you've paid for!"
3.0,need adjustment band
3.0,"Received a different color, but still liked it."
3.0,This product size is incorrect.  The size is actually 1 or 2 sizes smaller than the label says.
3.0,"The bottoms fit okay, it's not really high-wasted as I was hoping. It barely covered my belly-button and I was hoping it would go over it. The top is very cute, but for someone who is an A cup, it doesn't fit very well. Cups are not adjustable, so I couldn't use them. I had to buy a separate top, wish we could buy different size tops and bottoms. For the price, it was more hassle to return."
3.0,I love the look and practicality of these sandals but the sizing is off. Size 7/8 is way too big and size 5/6 way too small. A 6/7 would be perfect why doesn’t it exist!
3.0,No better than less expensive stuff as far as I can tell.
3.0,"Cute, but way too big. Sizing runs very large. Returned."
3.0,"too short, waist fits perfect."
3.0,Not so great with the spin
3.0,It didn’t come with split on the sides it’s not the shirt on the picture.
3.0,I love the look of this mask!! It is beautiful but very heavy for the face. It came without 2 stones!! They are big stones to be missing too. I wanted to be able to wear this mask so bad. It doesnt form aound the face either.
3.0,They are very comfortable but slip down in back when walking. I ordered small and still too loose.
3.0,"First-my sister loved the dress and plans on ordering her size. I however, went by the sizing chart and it was off. The dress has no give so it was snug around the waist and breast area. I might size up and see how that one fits."
3.0,Not what I expected but ok
3.0,"Very cute, and well made. Only 3 stars bc the top offers no real shape or support for &#34;the ladies&#34;. Gives you one giant long shapped boob."
3.0,"The pendant is cute, engraving is good. Size is as expected (picture next to short side of a gift card for reference)  However as another reviewer noted, there is no ring on the end of the chain to hook the clasp onto.  Makes it very difficult to connect."
3.0,the raiders never made the playoffs so this is the only thing that came out of that.  if you are a raider nation fan this will be a good addition to your closet
3.0,"Meh, ok I guess.  Constantly coming loose and needing to re-tighten too often."
3.0,Design....not as good as I thought....kinda on the small side as well
3.0,It looks good but doesn't fit much. Not even my bottle of 600ml water fits in here. They are ok if you're not carrying anything other than wallet and phone.
3.0,"I like the color of these and they fit my son great.  However, it's only been a couple of months and the toe of each shoe is already falling apart.  He does wear these almost every day to school and has recess every day so I know he's probably rough on them.  But, he's had other sneakers that have gotten the same amount of wear and tear on them but have held up much better and/or longer.  Already bought him another pair of sneakers today and went with a different brand (Fila)."
3.0,"Red 8.5<br />Boots fit nice and comfy!!  Unfortunately, each boot looked as though they belonged to another pair. One boot toe was badly scraped with damage to<br />Leather. Someone made a terrible attempt at repair. Quality control, if there is such a Dept.,should have seen this damage. I believe these are not seconds, but, maybe defective write offs. These were sold be 6PM.com through Amazon.<br />Beware as this pair WILL be recycled and sold again by them. 3 stars for comfort and fit."
3.0,"It seem to be good quality but as soon as it was opened and unfolded the gem falls off.  No biggie, but I mean when you buy something you don't want or expect for that to happen."
3.0,Polyester material itches couldn’t wear and smelled like strong laundry detergent nice color thought
3.0,slips
3.0,"The gloves arrived and the student is using them, although the wire brush has worn a hole through one of the fingers. The student didn't seem to think it was because the gloves were cheap."
3.0,"Cute and formal skirt. Worked well as part of a wedding outfit.<br />Length was a little too long, had to roll at the waist and cover with the fabric attachment. Elastic became bunched and there is now a small hole at the waist line"
3.0,Ended up returning. It runs a little big in my opinion. And not the most flattering leggings I’ve had.
3.0,"Love the fit, honestly my favorite brand of leggings. However lavender grey is the exact same color as violet storm. Not the grey pair that is depicted in the photo."
3.0,"The light is not very good.  This isn't usually a problem for me because I use it mainly when I am in well illuminated areas.  The buttons stick out quite a bit so when I flex my hand I sometimes accidentally switch the watch from am/pm to 24 hour mode.  This annoys me somewhat.  Meh, the watch is ok for the price.  In retrospect, I might have got something a little nicer.  But this may have it's uses."
3.0,"Although this mask is beautiful and very comfortable to wear, I was disappointed because the taller side wouldn’t stay up. It kept falling forward all night, so I had to keep adjusting it :("
3.0,"The zorro type hate is not what is in the pictures but it works for my needs. The hate actually came with a big Z on the front, which I ripped off. I ordered this hay because it wasn't supposed to have a z. Also the final picture that shows the tip in the top of th hat is what I got instead of the rest of the pictures with the rounded top."
3.0,Short could of been longer in length. Bought for 8 yr old size slim to wear under dresses for church.
3.0,I liked the bodice area (design) and lacy 3/4 sleeves very much but it didn't fit right on me.  I'm 5 feet so it (length-wise) does pass my knees a bit but I didn't mind that as much as the material.  It was on the thin side and has a plastic/polyester feel.  I would recommend with some hesitation as I returned it.
3.0,This dress is very comfortable but very short.  I am 5'8&#34; and could not wear this as a dress.
3.0,Fits a bit off
3.0,"Not a true red as I thought it would be, a bit brighter so it didn't match my dress.  The sides don't line up quite right... so if you only need this for a casual cover, it's acceptable."
3.0,Jacket was a bit too large. Size down.
3.0,"Not my favorite. This is more of a costume piece, which may be okay for some things, but not what I was looking for.  the adjustable ring size and material felt cheap to me."
3.0,It wasn't bad but the material was just not attractive. It was stiffer then anticipated but the fit was fine. It wasn't anything to brag about.
3.0,"I ordered the red, although I'm usually not a big fan of red but I liked how in the picture it looked like a darker red. But... When I received it, it was more bright, kinda leaning towards pink. :( so I will be returning it."
3.0,"I liked this case a lot when I recieved it but it’s been only a month now, since I have it and it’s broke. It’s not closing anymore, very disappointed. I had my previous case for two years. I am giving it three stars only because it’s not expensive."
3.0,I now have a blue stone ring to wear out for special occasions. Its not a everyday ring but it's pretty!
3.0,Great quality for the price however it did not pass the squat test. I bent over in front of my mirror and my black underwear was visible. Best to use when you’re doing low impact exercises or just wear as leggings. Really comfortable but definitely not gym appropriate.
3.0,"I love the design of these sunglasses, but Im a little bit disappointed because they lenses/frames are not as big as I thought they would be... But then again... its probably just me and my fat face lol. They are stunning though. I will still wear them, the fit is great and very comfortable.I just wish the lenses were a few centimeters bigger on all sides."
3.0,"Ordered this as it’s the same brand as my work shirts.<br />Ordered the same color as I figured I could where it on laundry days.<br />Unfortunately, it’s a tad tighter then my work shirts."
3.0,Doesn't hold its shape well
3.0,Very comfortable! Pants fit perfectly but the jacket is extremely too small which unfortunately lead me to return back the whole outfit :(
3.0,Pretty but not great quality. I ordered this by mistake and ended up returning it because it wasn't worth keeping.
3.0,"This was actually quite adorable, it was comfortable and Flowy. Due to reviews, I ordered a size up but the medium was extremely large. I was rather disappointed as the small and extra small was sold out. I returned it but may look into an extra small, unfortunately I had to go to Hawaii without it."
3.0,"Perfect fit, only complaint is that I wish the lenses were a little darker to protect my eyes a little more. If you don't have ultra sensitive eyes like I do, they are fantastic!"
3.0,"It looked nice however, it was constructed for someone who is short and not curvy. I am 5'7 and a curvy pear shape."
3.0,This shirts fits a links weird. The buttons don’t seem to line up with the loops above the pre-bottoned area. Soft and comfortable.$8
3.0,I went by the size chart and it fit small.  Also I had a hard time getting the collar to sit right without showing the seam near the neckline.  It would not be so bad except the seam looks like the inside seam because of the construction.
3.0,"There's nothing wrong with this, and the graphics are as cool as the pics, but the material is really thick (I prefer a lighter material) and the sizes run a bit small"
3.0,The cord down the sleeve is very stiff.
3.0,I liked the watch but the elevant's trunk was turned down and that's supposed to be bad luck so I've hesitated to wear it.
3.0,These was good for my Halloween costume. Just wish they wasn't like a highlighter color or neon orange and green. Wish the color was more like the photo as advertised.
3.0,They're just okay.
3.0,"The socks perform as you would expect, but they are so small that it's a struggle to put them on.  We ended up giving them to someone with a smaller foot."
3.0,Robe seems a little thin. A summer robe?
3.0,Beautiful dress. Feels great and fits really well except the upper arms. There is no give in the sleeve cuffs and I couldn't wear it for long periods of time.
3.0,Good quality. Did not tarnish
3.0,Quality of voice is not as clear as expected. Quality is not what I expected.  Does it work?  Yes.
3.0,it is ok for this price.material is much more coarse than you expected.
3.0,too shiny colors. not graceful at all. Shouting colors
3.0,"Not as vibrant in color as the pictures. Also, it only ties around the neck, which is not super comfortable. I will need to sew straps on in other places in order to wear it or it will just hang like a cape."
3.0,The quality is great! I have washed it several times and it still looks new and feels soft. The color is not the same advertised.
3.0,The waist trimmer is awesome!!!
3.0,"I love these earrings, but they arrived with a missing rhinestone and of all places it’s in the center of the earring."
3.0,"I have very fair skin and am sick of having sweat act as a conduit for sunscreen to get into my eyes and mouth. So, I decided that for working in the yard, I'd cover up with clothing instead of slathering up with sunscreen. I was looking for very lightweight pants that would be baggy enough that I'd be able to easily bend, squat and sit while pulling weeds, etc.  The size chart indicates that they run smaller than typical, American pants. So, I ordered up a size and they fit perfectly around the waist and through the rise. The length, on me is WAY shorter than what is pictured. With the pants sitting at my waist, (I'm female so that is probably a bit higher than most men would wear them) the hem of the legs is about 4 inches above the top of my foot. When seated, the hem is more like 6 to 8 inches above the top of my foot. I'm just shy of 5'9"" tall and most of my height is not in my legs. So, these pants seem quit a bit shorter than what is shown in the picture.<br /><br />The fabric quality is decent. On one pair, there is a weird spot that appears not to have taken the dye.<br /><br />The sewing quality is just OK. There are several spots where things roll in kind of a goofy way because the seams were not sewn properly. There were also lots of long threads left uncut that needed to be trimmed.<br /><br />Because I am wearing these pants to do messy work, I don't care that much about the shot legs, goofy seams, uncut threads or white patch where the fabric didn't take the dye. I just want something comfortable that will protect my skin from the sun. These pants are comfortable and have prevented even the slightest hint of pink from appearing after I have spent hours and hours toiling outside on sunny, spring days.<br /><br />When I sat down to write this review, I noticed that the price of these pants has nearly doubled since I purchased them. Given all the negatives that I mentioned above, these pants were barely worth what I paid for them. At double the price I paid, they are WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced. This quality of product is not worth any more than perhaps $15. So, if the price you are seeing is more than that, look elsewhere."
3.0,"While I love the colors of these skirts, one has paint stains on it. I am not opposed to recycled fabric, in fact I like the idea, but it should be in the advertising."
3.0,One of the pang was ripped :(
3.0,Expected better quality leather for the price
3.0,The band had a horrible scent that I couldn’t get rid of.  Also the plaid was only on one of the band sides. The other side was just a stripe.
3.0,"I wear an xl in everything & this dress was fitting a size too small. I could have worn it, but it was not flowy, I’d recommend going a size up."
3.0,My wife's review below.....<br /><br />I gave the tops 3 stars because they rise /roll up during your workout so you have to keep straightening it out every few minutes which is quite annoying and takes away from focusing on your workout.  They do wick away your sweat and the material is comfortable but the roll up issue is really annoying.
3.0,"TOO BIG AND HEAVY, ONLY RECEIVED HALF PRICE REFUND"
3.0,"Ordered up a size, large instead of medium as suggested, I am 5' 2"" and dress came above the knee before being washed, picture is a before washing picture. More of a shiny blue than a cotton look, pockets look cheap to me but it works."
3.0,Cute hat but runs big. My son has a large head for his age and the xs/s is still to big.
3.0,"The color was good but the size was to big , I returned the product for a refund. Other than size it was a nice looking bag . Thanks Gloria"
3.0,Ugh these are really short & ultra thin.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Update:  The company contacted me; they stated they were taking my comments into consideration for improving their product.  They sent me a complimentary pair of these pants which were longer and a little less thin feeling.  Good customer service.
3.0,"I really liked these pjs as they fit my chunky 9 month old baby. Unfortunately, they are barely a month old and the zipper has started splitting at the bottom. Generally I can fix it by unzipping and rezipping but having a broken zipper in the middle of the night is not ideal. Of course it was just past the return window when the problem started to crop up so I guess I will just deal with this pair until I can’t fix it at all. I do have another pair in a different pattern by this brand that hasn’t had this issue."
3.0,"When I got the dress, some of parts of it were falling off (like the part where they cut the holes at the bottom). It was like some of the holes just weren’t cut all the way through so I had to rip some of them the rest of the way off. I liked how the dress fit but the material was very itchy"
3.0,Bracelet came broken and obviously not of great quality-would not buy it again
3.0,"This top is cute if you are going for an 8 months pregnant look. That is not the look I wanted to achieve, so I returned it."
3.0,This skirt fit a little big on me but it was  comfortable and cute
3.0,Very cute. Wish it was a bit longer so you dont see where it ends and that it wraps all around. Other than that im enjoying it.
3.0,Screen print not what I expected and very short. If you hold your hands over your head your bra will show.
3.0,I bought to use for a thin necklace I have a hard time latching and it’s too bulky when handling.
3.0,Only so-so satisfaction....the pearls are strung tightly so the entire thing hangs awkwardly. But.....I suppose I should have taken the bulk of pearls into account when I ordered it.
3.0,They r great but are way to big for a women. So sad about that
3.0,The shoes is to light
3.0,It's to shirt wasted
3.0,"I have ordered this brand before and it was true to size, this dress was a bit larger but I love the fabric, I gave it to my mother and she love it."
3.0,Great Shirt but way too big
3.0,Is hard to take it off without dropping the hair on the person/floor
3.0,"The sleeves were too long. However, the hoody was the perfect size, so I decided to reduce the sleeve's size myself because on medium size probably his head wouldn't fit. My son loves it."
3.0,My husband never used because is to small
3.0,I like the look of these but the lens popped out before I even wore them once.
3.0,Overall the product seemed fine but after trying to attach to my glasses the threads started to come undone.
3.0,This product was huge. It wouldn't even stay on my hips. I usually run within a small to medium. I got a medium and it was huge I felt like an xs was in need. I would suggest to order your actually size on clothing and not go by the chart.
3.0,It's thinner and a little bit flimsier than I expected.
3.0,"I purchased a extra large, it fits but the aesthetic of it just does not work for me the brim is to short to really protect your face from the suns rays."
3.0,Color in the picture is not accurate. It’s much more peach then pink. But it’s still fabulous
3.0,Great idea but as other reviewers have noted there is a bit too much fabric so that they do show a bit when wearing with pumps.
3.0,One pair broke when I taking it out the package.. I glued the post back on.. it was bent but i straighten it with pliers.. we will see how that works.. they are very cute.. will update after wearing
3.0,So I thought I ordered an XL but I received a Large. Since I am in the process of losing weight I am going to hold onto it. It is flattering even if it is a little tight right now. I would say it is true to size. And the material is soft.
3.0,Ordered the dark brown and received the light brown. Other then that very nice wallet. No issues yet
3.0,Nice looking in pic but the size was off. Nice seller but never buy item without a return policy.
3.0,"An affordable option, but somewhat cheap feeling."
3.0,Very pretty necklace and anklet. I really liked them but I only gave it 3 stars because it tarnished after the first time wearing it.
3.0,"It's cute overall. I find the elastic a little tight and the drawcord is only for decoration.<br />But for the price, this is not bad."
3.0,"The material is lot different than I thought, its more of a satin silk kind, no tag inside whatsoever on how to wash/dry or even a size! It is kinda long and Im an average height woman. Other than those few flaws it fits the correct way in the waist line."
3.0,"Most aprons repell water somewhat,  this one doesnt. It’s very cute and I wear it when I’m cooking but can’t wear it anytime I am using water for anything as I get my clothes wet."
3.0,"This fits me like a dress (5'2&#34;). I am keeping it because I can wear it to bed, but it is NOT a shirt."
3.0,Smaller than it appears
3.0,"Swim suit is really cute. However the cut is totally wrong and the suit is short. The cut for the bust is low and covers really oddly. The lower part of the suit is loose on me and fits weird.<br />Luckily i have swim shorts and im going to wear them over the suit.<br />But if i didn't have the shorts, I would have returned it."
3.0,"The color and style are given more justice in pictures. The blue isn't as bright and materials look very cheap. The smell is a bit displeasing but I had no problem with the zipper like others mentioned. I'm just scared of it scratching my phone screen when entering and exiting the large department. Otherwise, fits my Galaxy S4 with a Commuter Otterbox case and still has space! Great if you own a lot of cards :)"
3.0,"These are fairly decent socks.  The low cut design makes them easy to wear and on my Women's size 12 feet, they work well.  They aren't the highest quality so I'm not sure how long they will hold up to regular use.  They wash pretty well although there was shrinking in the dryer, even though I washed and dried them at medium temperatures.  The nice navy color is neutral so I'm able to wear them with several types of casual outfits.  I'm interested to see how these work and wear with ankle boots this fall.  I usually have issues with ladies socks being too short or too wide, if they are a larger size, but these Men's socks work really well for me."
3.0,Fit like ray-ban wayfarer but lens isn't very clear
3.0,"Comfy, but not super durable. I wear these to cover my tattoos at work and they don’t last longer than a few weeks"
3.0,The sweater wasn't what I expected. It's a bit small even though I ordered a size up but the material is nice and soft. The image is okay but kinda smaller then shown in the picture. And the side sleeves are more at the back of the arm rather then the side... Idk how I feel about it. I wouldn't order it again but I don't feel the need to return it becuase it wasn't horrible...
3.0,"I ordered this and two other vests of different colors as a gift for a friend who's officiating a wedding this weekend. His chest is 52"" and his waist is 44"". To be on the ""safe side"" I ordered XXL where, according to your size chart, the vests should fit just right to a bit loose. HOWEVER, they're all too tight and they don't come in XXXL. The size chart needs serious adjusting..!!!"
3.0,"Liked speedy delivery of Prime. Green & black color goes perfectly with the color of the waterproof Lifeproof Fre case I have for my Galaxy S9Plus phone. Haven't used it yet but plan to use it when I go swimming indoors, now that it's cold here & also when I go down to Fla. & to Europe. Gave only 3 stars as some of the stitching has some lose threads hanging & the black plastic tabs at each side of the wrist float feel rough & I hope won't be uncomfortable in use nor unravel. Time will tell..."
3.0,I felt they were a little heavy for our 3mo. old infant although it said that they were appropriate for that age.
3.0,"They are cute as heck. I knew I didn’t want all of them, but one of the ones I got didn’t come with the back connector piece for the crocs. It was one of the ones I was looking forward to. Not worth returning. The rest of the “jibbitz” I got were awesome and worth the money."
3.0,"These are really cute and even have subtle contouring, but I could see every bit of cellulite through them :( They have no compression whatsoever for me"
3.0,They were great but green was a color I specifically needed and there was NO green in the package.
3.0,"The top is too small for me but the bottom fits, I am like a 40 DD so  not too surprised I can however use the bottom with other tops I already have so it is still nice. The top also has not type of support or wiring if you need that this may not work for you. The bottoms are made well and seem to stay in place I like the style and color I am still trying to hide some left over baby weight but hate one pice so this was a great compromised. As I lose more weight I think I will like this more and more. Again I really love the retro design<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in order to conduct and honest review of the Retro printed two piece bathing suit"
3.0,Sizing WAY off!
3.0,"Looks great love the style but it's not water resistant, in simple wear like washing my hands it's started to tarnish from the inside and shows through the face plate. Soo sad."
3.0,"These are cute but the risk of this is its a variety of colors and you don't know what. I received pink, purple, orange and black. My daughter loves it while playing tea party but the color kind of rough when friends come to play. They fight for the girly colors."
3.0,Fits OK and smell is acceptable.
3.0,"Nice swimsuit but top where the knot is does not tie right. The straps are way too long and skinny for one knot and when I try different knots or bow or wrapping it, never looks right. Color is nice and bottom fits great."
3.0,"Finding hoop earrings with backs like these is near impossible anymore so I was thrilled to find these. They are just okay, thicker hoop than I was hoping for, but they are wearable. I was also hoping the silver was more shiny. These seem to have a bit of a dull color to them."
3.0,"Cute but had to return, too big in the chest for me, there was a strange color defect on the top front, an area was faded. Would buy again if the fit was right"
3.0,"Runs super small. I wear a size 4 and this is tighter than I hoped it would be. It may work, we shall see."
3.0,A littler tight I would recommend to buy a size larger. Other wise it's Nice and light.
3.0,Doesn’t fit  like the picture. Very small at the beast area
3.0,"Fits tight! Couple months in and almost all the H is gone, started peeling off instantly. Super disappointed, especially for the price!"
3.0,Peals were already falling off before it even arrived. As it was a present and I had the ability to glue back on it still got gifted but very disappointed in the quality.  The foundation necklace was nice though.
3.0,The shirt was a good material but the sizes was small
3.0,not knit fabric
3.0,"These yoga pants are OK, not great. The waist doesn't fit snug enough. This could be because I have a fairly small waist, but I really don't think that's the issue. I got a small and the fit in the legs but I find that I was constantly pulling them up because the waist was a little too big. They get the job done though, but they won't be my go to yoga pants."
3.0,Dress is very nice and flowy but a bit to tight on the bust area.
3.0,"This shirt is so cute, so I was very disappointed with the fit when it arrived. I sized up and it fit fine across the chest and waist but it was shorter than I would've liked it to be for working out. The material is nice and thick and I love the moons on the back but unfortunately this wasn’t the right fit for me so I chose to return it."
3.0,The bottom material is very rough not soft at all and you must iron it.
3.0,So nice to find a foldable kids umbrella. Would be safer if the ends had those plastic balls on them.
3.0,"Very pretty, but not plus size.  3x is maybe size 1x"
3.0,Sleeves are a little tighter than I would have liked
3.0,They get the job done I ordered a 42 mm I think they run a little small it seems to fit exactly the same as my 40 m m did and they're pretty narrow so the really tight fit so I'm sure I'll be losing the O-ring to it
3.0,"It is nice but the it is a lot darker pink and nothing like the light pink in their photo. It also fits more like a SMALL than the medium it says it is.  But I will just keep it, because I hate having to do returns."
3.0,"The material is very thin, has to wear a tank and slip underneath because it’s very see-through"
3.0,"I love these sandals, however, this is my 2nd pair, still trying to find a fit.  I am a size 8, but had to order a 7 in the Reefs.  The reason being that the straps that hold you foot are tooooooooo  wide!  It's hard to walk with flip flops that your toes have to hold in place, otherwise they fall.<br />I purchase my first pair at the store and they were incredibly soft, but the strap was toooo wide. So now I ordered the 7 and the strap is still tooooooo wide!~  I hope the manufacturer Reef reads all our comments and makes a strap for normal feet. It should be at least an inch less."
3.0,Very soft but run a little small.
3.0,Beautiful but broke in 2 weeks
3.0,Product Positives: Package includes four caps and four wig caps at a reasonable price.<br /><br />Product Negatives: Caps do not stay in place well. Those with longer hair using a wig cap will have to readjust.
3.0,I’m returning it. Based on reviews I ordered a large instead of my normal medium but it was too big. It also looked frumpy on me and fabric was too stiff and billowed out on all the wrong places. Maybe if the fabric would soften with wash/wear it would be better? Brick red is definitely a rust color.
3.0,"They are a tight fit, so if your face is not slim the glasses will be a bit tight. Great style though..."
3.0,"These were a good value. However, each package contained a broken broach. I was able to glue the pin to the back of the broach on most of the broken pins."
3.0,"Nothing like the picture. It is a lot shorter than the picture. It is very thin, but it is still an OK shirt."
3.0,"Well made but tight and very constricting, caused leg swelling in older people (one man and then also in a woman with smaller feet, so had to give away).  Return process cumbersome involving having to provide address again, so we just gave them away.  May be fine for young people doing yoga.  Did not work for older people in my household."
3.0,"I would suggest ordering a size up in this bra.  This bra is super cute but definitely cuts into your ribs if you order your normal size.  For reference I have a chicken size ribcage, i’m a 5’2” lady with a 34B bra size and small was so small I had a hard time getting into it."
3.0,very short cut and oddly has the tags on the outside. didnt mind too much just cut off the tags. my son says they are comfy but they are extremely short cut on him he will outgrow them fast
3.0,The product is great. We did not read the description well and did not realize it was a women size and not youth. But the product itself is fine
3.0,"I had a severe allergic reaction to the band stud, it burnt a perfect circle hole in my wrist. But the band was extremely comfortable"
3.0,"these are not substantial, they certainly are feminine. With washing, they wrinkle...I would not order again."
3.0,Great color but the lenses were too thin to fit in the rims properly and they wobble and shake around. The company was very gracious when I contacted them about it. This 3 stars
3.0,"Not too cheap in quality but don't expect to be able to see very well in them. Great to wear when it is really sunny and when you aren't going to move around a lot.<br /><br />Vision with them is so bad, I almost hit on a larger chick."
3.0,"These are good quality. They would look great on someone, but not me.  It looked awkward in the hips."
3.0,"This is a nice, well-made jacket but the color was described as ""ivory"" but it's actually the color in the picture - more beige/tan.  Initially thought the color was off in the picture due to it sometimes being hard to get a true color on a computer.  Still searching for a winter white.  Will be returning this."
3.0,too short for my torso (I'm 5'7&#34;) but seems well-made.
3.0,Picture makes it look better than it really is but it's still a cute design. The lace is cheap and unfinished. Once trimmed its great.
3.0,It felt very thin/cheap
3.0,They fade very fast and ride down while I walk.<br />So disappointed
3.0,"My wife loved these until she tried to put them on. They are easily a half size smaller than labeled. Oh well, that’s life and then you... I guess you buy a little larger."
3.0,Loved the colors and the fit. The negative was my profession causes me to wash ny hands often/use hand sanitizer so the colors/design started to fade.
3.0,"More cream than it looks in the photo, also pretty small; fits like a US size small."
3.0,color looks fake
3.0,"I received this as a gift. First off, this band is cute. I love the colors and how fun it is. It comes as just the band, no frame, so either you'll need to buy a frame to go with it or just replace the pins every time. (I bought a frame so I didn't have to mess with the pins each time.)<br /><br />There are two cons for me: 1) it's very stiff, which makes it a little tough to get on and off. 2) It's pretty large and I have small wrists. For it to be tight for a workout, I have to cinch it to the last hole; for every day wear I put it to the 2nd or 3rd hole (2nd hole is too tight at times for daily wear, 3rd hole is pretty loose). There was no option for a smaller band, that I can see."
3.0,"Very good unbreakable and vision clear sunglasses for a child. The only warning and the reason for the low review status is that the rubber on the sides could come off so be sure they are tight and you keep an eye out if they come off. If they do, it won't be a comfort issue but rather a potential hazard since it is pointy and sharp. We had one where it came off, but we returned it and purchased a new one and haven't had an issue with the new one. If the rubber is tight and doesn't seem like it will come off, you will be very happy with the purchase."
3.0,"I love the comfort and style, but the noise is too much. It seems to be the Ortho insert making the noise. I'm going to try to replace it with something quieter."
3.0,Measurement tips inaccurate.
3.0,"What they fail to tell you about is the slit in the back of dress that goes all the way up to your a-hole.  Seriously, I am 5'6&#34; at 145 lbs and do not have a very big butt or hips.  Just to make sure I wasn't out of my mind I had my daughter who is 5'3&#34; at 130 lbs try it on and it did the same thing. A-hole out!"
3.0,The item is priced well but is not as comfortable as others I have tested.  I would recommend looking at other alternatives.
3.0,"me encanta esta marca es la preferida de mi hijo vino con detalle en la costura, por lo que seria conveniente revisar los despachos"
3.0,"They work fine, but they're heavier than others I've had in the past."
3.0,"I’m happy with the purchase with what I need them for, for the price. They are thin, stretchy, form fitting. I use them at the gym. A little tighter and thinner than ideal. I ended up cutting the bottom 4 inches off because it was too long- it could almost work as a minidress!"
3.0,Shipping was fast but product was missing a nail on one of the gloves and three of the nails were glued on the side of the finger tips.
3.0,This top is super super cute but it runs TWO SIZES TOO SMALL! I normally wear an XXL but and XXL in this top felt like a L...BUY TWO SIZES UP!!!
3.0,LOVED TOP BUT<br />VERY SMALL HAD TO RETURN
3.0,"This is a cute dress, looks as pictured however i am a size 20 and the 4xl was too small, it can wrap but the bottom is wide open when sitting, i might wear it as a kimono or beach cover up but cannot wear as a dress."
3.0,"Mmhm doubt I’ll wear it unless I hav long sleeves under, it’s an itchy material. The complete opposite of soft and comfortable."
3.0,There nice if you have big nipples. I don't so the bar is to long.
3.0,"I was expecting it to fit better, will not be buying again"
3.0,Get what you pay for.  Cute but don't last long.
3.0,"The Terry robe fits more like a 2x...Really big for a large...I like the fabric and the style very much, but it could fit a little better..."
3.0,"Although I like the glasses, i had them a couple weeks and last weekend I already scratched the lens (I don't even remember doing anything that would have caused it) and it now has a line running down it. Very annoying, wish I could get an exchange."
3.0,Crei qué era más acogedor para el frio y es una tela delgada. Sinceramente no me gusto. Sorry.
3.0,Wish I had bought mthe dress in a larger and longer size....but thanks!!
3.0,"The watch is OK.  I have a Casio Pathfinder that I love, and figured I would buy a Pro Trek as a back up.  The ProTrek is bulkier which is fine, i'd prefer it to be sleeker, but I can deal with it.  What was really disappointing the the cheap band that comes with it.  At the end of the band there is a raised area that prevents you from removing it from your wrist.  I was 5 seconds away from getting scissors to cut it off since band was such a pain to get off.  I really had to apply alot of pressure to remove it, and I dont think I will keep the watch as its such a pain to remove.  The rest of the features are similar to the Pathfinder and are ok.  I prefer the time in the center in bigger size which makes it easy to read.  The 'backlight' is not the true backlight that I had on the pathfinder, its more of a side light.  Not what I was expecting.  Overall I was disappointed with this purchase."
3.0,I Love the way the way this watch band looks.  I wish it was a little bigger.  I have to put it on the last notch.
3.0,It is kind of okay and It wasn't like in the picture and the golden hanger is looks like cheap and I returned back.
3.0,"Very soft gloves that fits my hands perfectly, although I wasn't too satisfied with the &#34;touchsceen&#34; feature, it didn't work well (you really had to press hard) and over time, it didn't respond to touch at all. But as gloves to keep your hands warm, these are really nice."
3.0,Not very warm and screen touch is not perfect. So so gloves for winter and phone usage.
3.0,I have a bigger chest and this dress did not fit that at all
3.0,I really love these leggings but the material is WAY too thin. When I bend over in them you can see everything through them. I bought these to work out in and now I can't because you can see my legs and the color panties I'm wearing underneath.
3.0,Only good for someone very skinny ( the. Extended length material rides up) and no cup support.
3.0,"I get tons of compliments on this when I wear it.  I love the length of the chain, and the quality is surprisingly good for the price (I paid around $10).  I would recommend it, but I probably wouldn't give it as a gift.  It's a bit chintzy for that."
3.0,Like the look of these glasses but they are too wide for my face and fall off. Cant wear them
3.0,"Was missing a nose rubber piece, have to take to optometry guy."
3.0,"The color was a pictured, but the sleeves were longer than shown and the dress was longer than shown in the picture (to my ankles)"
3.0,"I fell in love with the vibrant colors from the picture and the end product didn't disappoint. The material is lightweight though so don't plan on wearing it in cold winter weather. Also, I do not recommend this product if you're in a situation where you might find yourself needing to wash the garment frequently (like if you have small, sticky fingered children) because after the first wash it was noticeably faded and several washes later (yes I actually followed the instructions to the letter on washing it) its still a cute pink sweater but not the vibrant hot pink tye-dye that I had planned to have embroidered with a fun 30something birthday saying."
3.0,"I ordered an XL even though the suggested size for me was an L-I like some extra room in sweatpants. So glad I got the XL because they BARELY fit. The butt portion of these sweatpants is not for someone with junk in your trunk.<br /><br />Are they ok? Sure. Is it decent for like $13? Yeah, but I wouldn’t order again."
3.0,"This is a really cute and trendy layering piece. I would have given this more stars, but the fabric is incredibly thin and the belt has a raw edge to it. It is overpriced for what it is, its definitely a $10-$15 item."
3.0,"Im 5'2 @160 lbs with D cups and bought a large, because it said fits as expected, and it totally fits. So cute, love the women's cut, its super flattering. Wish they had more patterned T's that I liked."
3.0,Cute dress but extra straps are way too long. Good in theory not so much in execution. Wouldn’t but again
3.0,material wear out too soon
3.0,description said hinged and you have to bend the  loop to wear them
3.0,Tiny..  Cheap.  Cant expect much for the price
3.0,"generic, will work for work"
3.0,"As pictured, if you have small wrist it fits well with a little stretch. Would be slightly to small for a larger wrist, cutting of circulation."
3.0,"I got a really good deal on these flip flops, unfortunately they hurt the top of my feet when walking in them. I really want to like them because they look nice, but there is something about the edges of the top part of the shoe that cause an uncomfortable pressure when walking."
3.0,Started peeling after only wearing them once. They were cute but would not buy again
3.0,Beutiful piece unfortunately came damege so couldn't use it
3.0,"doesn't work as well as the one that came with the unit.  I also don't like the cone entry, you get too much clamping too far away from the base which is where it should be tight.  end up looking like a baseball bat"
3.0,Smaller than I expected.  At least it is American Made.
3.0,Loved the color and everything about it but it fits weird at the collar. Worth the price!!!
3.0,"The hearts on the tutu skirt come off during the first time worn…<br /><br />It’s adorable, but if it can only be worn once, it’s not worth it!"
3.0,Seemed like very nice comfortable slippers but were too long and too wide
3.0,Kinda cheaply made and maybe knock off Gudetama mercy tbh but they’re pretty cute and warm
3.0,"Good enough quality for the price. My size 7 had a little knick in it and that's the size I needed. The 6 is a bit too tight, but overall a decent ring."
3.0,"Great watch, however the Rose gold plating is very thin and it started to show wear after about four days of use, I have the same watch in white metal and it is doing very well and one of my favorite watches."
3.0,So sad about this one. Bust was not as described. About an inch off. Hoping to find someone to fix the issue because it's beautiful.
3.0,"These fit very big, way to big for my kids."
3.0,"It was just the kurti, no churidhar or leggings included. The kurti was good though."
3.0,Very pretty blouse. The colors were vibrant. However the seaming along the top was my  coming apart when I received it. The blouse was pretty large and didn’t fit as expected. But I made it work and decided to keep it. Did get compliments while wearing it so I guess that was good.
3.0,I bought these for my daughter but they were too small.  The sizing was difficult to figure out. I kept them for myself since I have smaller feet.
3.0,"The purse is fine; however, the description is misleading.  It says it is 7&#34; wide and it is at the bottom of the purse.  The opening is not 7&#34;. I ordered it so that I could get my I Phone 6 Plus in it.  It is difficult to get the phone in it, since the opening is not 7&#34;."
3.0,The belt is great but the buckle is the weak link. The buckle hit the floor and the latch pin came apart and now I have a paperweight.
3.0,Super soft.. good for wear under other clothing.. NOT COMPRESSION
3.0,the part that you stuck in your ear bends very easily
3.0,"I ordered a M (I'm 5'7, 150lbs) and it is very thin and very form fitting. It looks more like an undershirt than a work out tank."
3.0,"Husband liked the boot but it was too short. He normally wears a size 9 and that's what I bought but his toes hit the end of the shoe. He said his heel was slipping a bit, even though the boot wasn't long enough, so we couldn't go to a larger size. I returned it to Amazon. They make returns SO easy!!"
3.0,I love the style of this shirt but I wish it was a little bit longer (I am 5'11 so finding longer shirts is a struggle for me). The sleeves are nice and long though and they have thumb holes; which I didn't know before purchase and was pleasently suprised about!<br />The front pocket is crooked... I didn't realize it when I purchased but I think it's a cute addition.
3.0,"A shorter bar than I was expecting and the balls are a little bigger than normal, but overall super cute."
3.0,"These are cute and I think I will wear them but they are kinda crafty looking, like you would buy them at a craft fair and the color is much more blue than green."
3.0,If you put these shirts in the dryer they shrink down 1-2 sizes the first set I got not no longer fits
3.0,"They looked and felt nice but I could tell that they were too big for me, so I didn't try them on.I'm returning g them today"
3.0,I ordered the one with gold but was sent the opposite smh still is a nice earring. I dont hate it but i also dont love it.
3.0,"Cute, but NOT a dress. More of a long shirt."
3.0,"I really wanted to love these but they didn’t fit. They will go together but then are wayyyy too far apart and look fake (Yes, I know they ARE fake, but more fake). After a couple minutes, they really hurt your nose too. I’m still giving 3 stars because they look nice and can manipulate a little to look better."
3.0,"The shirt runs small.  It is really beautiful shirt.  Being it is cotton, not sure how it will be after washed."
3.0,A little big.. Hoping it will shrink in the wash lol.. I still wear it though.
3.0,"This dress is very cute, but very thin and see through."
3.0,This dress does not fit as expected.  I wear a medium.  The bottom fits great but the top feels like it is two sizes smaller.  My bust is not huge.  I wear a medium top and bottom.
3.0,My daughter loves it. Size up!
3.0,it was too long for neck size
3.0,"I’ll start by saying I thought the material would be better quality. I’m torn, because the print is cute and the zipper is cute but the material just looks cheap. I don’t dislike it, but I don’t love it either. For the price though, it’s not bad. I usually wear a M/L but bought an XL and it fits good so it does run a little small"
3.0,LOVE THE DESIGHN BUT TO SMALL AT THE SHOULDERS THANK YOU
3.0,"I like it…but it’s just too long for me. The piece where it connects to the key ring is about an inch too long, as are the legs. I wanted something more compact and not flailing around in the wind when I ride. It’s whipping around like a whacky inflatable arm flailing tubeman."
3.0,The bottom of the shirt flares out and it is not as long as I would like. Otherwise the quality of very good!
3.0,I think the title sums it up.  For $20 I wasn't expecting to much.  It created a lot of lint and loose strings the first time I washed it.  Overall it'll serve it's purpose.  OH just FYI it's shorter than it looks in the picture.  I am 5'3&#34; and it doesn't come all the way down to my ankles.  Lower calf I'd say.
3.0,I love the color and style but way too small! I’m usually float between 8.5-9. I bought the 9 and I think size 9.5-10 would be just right. Bummed because overall I really like these! 😕
3.0,I wear a 3xl normally but I wanted something nice and big and comfy so I got a 5XL and it fit just like a 3xl so that sucked.
3.0,It fits ok but I didn’t receive the belt unfortunately. I do love the color though.
3.0,Nice picture but no sizing on the product seemed odd to me and caused me to order something that was too small.
3.0,"These ended up being WAY smaller than I expected. I was planning on giving them away to my friends who play league, but that isn't happening. Still, a nice piece of memorabilia to line the shelves of my cave.<br /><br />P.S. I didn't expect much for the price, was trying to clear the rest of my gift card. Wouldn't really recommend."
3.0,Soft and comfy however difficult to put a filter inside because they were too big and mask ran a bit small
3.0,Didn’t even fit my teenage daughters head well. Needs to be made bigger.
3.0,"I wish there was an option to mix sizes because I'm pretty bottom heavy, so the bottom fit fine but the top is huge. Cute though if you have the boobs to fill it."
3.0,Product is fine. Glasses feel cheap- like those free promo sunglasses people hand out. Definitely have bought better sunglasses for the price. Saving grace is it comes with a decent case.
3.0,This arrived last night with a broken bead.  I'll be returning it - not sure yet if I'm getting a replacement or not.  I wanted a rosary for my son to last his entire lifetime.  I'm not confident that this one will work for that long.
3.0,you can't see through it! What's the point of a mask that you can't see through. I'm planning to return it.
3.0,"I found the idea of being able to add several pictures in this unique pendent appealing and the price seemed more than fair. I ordered two, one silver and one rose gold. When they arrived SIX WEEKS LATER I was disappointed to say the least.They were very cheap looking and the silver one wouldn't even stay closed. I have asked to return this one. I gave the other one to my daughter. She said she liked it."
3.0,"Pretty dress.  The empire waste, which is fitted, was much too small.  The dress is lined and is very heavy.  Don't consider it in warner weather."
3.0,"Looks like the photo. They’re a bit scratchy and thick in fabric, they also shed a lot. But cute!"
3.0,"These run narrow.  I am always an 8.5 in Madden Girl, but I couldn't get my foot in these.  They fit my friend who's usually a 7.5/8 perfectly.  Other than that, they're gorgeous.  I will be ordering again, just need a size up this time."
3.0,It just fits weird. It not like pictured. It looks like a mess tied up in the front versus the pic. Great material but just didn’t work for me.
3.0,The top was too large and the bottom was too small. The strings that wrap were a strange length and would end up on my front side when wrapping. it was very cute just the size difference was too much for me. I'm a 6 size jean wearer and c cup top.
3.0,"I like the colour and how it stays attached to my glasses; however, I have long hair and the silicon material sticks to my hair just like a rubber band would. I will only use this holder strap when I wear my hair up in a pony tail."
3.0,Poor quality. And dress is different from how it looks in the picture.
3.0,Putting it on luggage the first time was very hard.  I hope I don't have trouble with TSA.
3.0,This worked really good for my son. It's not hot for him at he is in summer school. It does have a problem trying to fold down with the filter in them. This is not a good idea for my girls. It kept falling down with her hair down. I tired putting their hair up and it still made it too slick to stay up.
3.0,I really like the print but the top is a bit tight and the bottom a bit loose..strange fit but will work for a short period of time
3.0,"Loved them, until I lost one of them the first time I wore it. I just went shopping but must have done something that make it fall out. Very sad, but not going to buy them again.I'd probably loose it again. I am active I suppose. I usually wear hook type earrings that don't fall out."
3.0,"Love this set, so much fun and a great price! Only bummer was the butterfly earring set was so squished one was an oval and the hinge clasp didn’t work :("
3.0,"If you have sensitive skin, this top may be uncomfortably scratchy in the neckline. Perhaps I need to wash it with softener ten times. Otherwise it is of acceptable quality."
3.0,"The fit was loose,, which i thought would be an asset,, but it just felt like pajamas or a nightgown. Also the color was wrong.. a yellow-green."
3.0,Very cute the top was too tight.
3.0,"I had to return because the XL size was too small for me. I was able to put the blouse on, but it didn't look puffy/flowly like it does in the picture."
3.0,"I got it in a 2 xl and was pissed AT FIRST because it looked really tiny, but it is really comfortable to sleep in and it fits tight on my body. I recieved it very fast (it shipped from california to tampa florida) and I purchased 2 of them for the price of 15.00. Good deal, I like them, will just have to hand wash them and do not dry them because they have metal hooks in the front for the attachment."
3.0,Too tight! But it is a beautiful dress! The top part fit ok but the part my tummy was not flattering at all.  I knew it would probably be too tight since I did take my measurements but I was hoping I would be wrong.
3.0,They are okay would like them a little longer.
3.0,"I ordered these and they arrived quickly using my Amazon Prime account.  The sunglasses are decent quality made of nicer plastic for the price.  I was a bit surprised these were a bit smaller than I expected.  They still fit, but they're a bit snug. Also keep in mind these are polarized sunglasses.  I have been having a bit of trouble seeing the dash of my car at times while wearing these as the polarization effect is in full force with these.  I think they're okay overall.  I've had many pair of sunglasses that are better, but many that are worse."
3.0,"I ordered a small one but received a XXL. The color is cute and fabric feels soft, would like to try but too large"
3.0,"the item is great; but I bought it about 2 weeks ago, and the bracelet part already broke off of it... so now its just a wallet without the wrist part, makes me a little upset, and if your iphone has a case on it, it will make the wallet hard to close"
3.0,"Very pretty,but I didn't realize it's not a break away laynard.For safety in workplace,I need one that will breakaway when resident grabs it."
3.0,Cute top but huge! Sadly I will be returning!
3.0,Wickaway material easy with no pockets
3.0,Starting to peel after 4 or 5 washes
3.0,"It works to protect the watch , but moisture gets under it . I had it about 3wks I do have a lot of scratches on the plastic cover so I am glad I brought something to protect watch . I will buy another when it gets to the point I can't see through the scratches."
3.0,Didn’t like the way it fits and the shoulder straps are way too wide
3.0,The stone is very pretty the chain is very cheap. Looks used. Does not match the pretty pendant.
3.0,The material is good but there are many products with a better materials
3.0,"The print I recieved has blue tones that do not appear in the original artwork as if whatever printer that was used was running low on certain inks. Also, yes it is a tad blurry, probably as a result of the sourced image's resolution not being the highest. Which by itself would not be a super big problem, but with the aforementioned printing error it does push it into being mediocre. The paper stock is at least of a decent enough quality."
3.0,Would be better if they were longer
3.0,"This bralette does not have wiring or any other uncomfortable issues. I was mostly looking for something comfortable to sleep in so this fit the bill for that. This bralette was just an ok quality and I'm not sure that it would last a long time. I do think that it would look very nice under a top with the lace peeking out like a camisole, however, I would not recommend for women larger than a 36C."
3.0,"I thought it would be tighter around the neck area, but the opening is so large I am not sure if I will keep the dress.  I was hoping for the opening to fit more comfortable around the neck.  Disappointed because I like the dress."
3.0,"I am 34"" around the bust, and a B cup. My breasts are flatter and wider. These were good for the flat and wide aspect. That's about it. I ordered a 36B and the band was too tight, but cups fit well. Then a 38B, where the band was just right, but the cups gaped and my breasts could only half fill them. These were a miss for me."
3.0,they tend to slip off the heel but they get the job done if that doesnt bother  you
3.0,The cowl neck is awful.  It doesn’t lay as pictured.  It’s just loose and floppy.  It rolls up.  The rest of the shirt is great and beautiful.
3.0,looks real nice but not sure if its real leather.....stiching on bag seems like will tear apart.....will rate this over a long term period........great looking tho
3.0,"Theyre nice, and extremely confortable and very nice, but one of them did get bent on both sides (one more then the other). I dont know if it was when it was packaged or when it was shipped, but it got caught in the folds of one of the openings and was bent. Hopefully its an easy fix, but who knows.<br />Update: easy to bend, which is concerning, and i wasnt able to bend it back straight, it now looks like trying to draw a straight line with no guide."
3.0,IT is comfortable. THe sleeves are a bit tight
3.0,I’ve had these a week and already have a hole in the thigh.
3.0,"These fit nicely and are super warm and cozy, BUT, 2 of the 4 got holes in the toe area on the first couple hours of wear. The other 2 seem to be holding up. Love the designs."
3.0,It's alright..
3.0,bit too see-through but I can add a camisole under and it's fine.
3.0,"Let me start by saying the bag itself is great. Nice quality, stitching is perfect, color is great, definitely brand new with tags attached. My 3 out of 5 stars comes because of packaging. I ordered this with international shipping to be delivered in Thailand and they only used a simple plastic amazon bag!! The purse was crushed. The picture I’ve included shows the way the bag looks (deformed) and this picture is with it stuffed to try to bring its shape back. I’m totally disappointed because I feel like it should have been shipped in a box to prevent it from being flattened. I paid quite a bit for shipping expenses the least they could have done was use proper packaging to ensure the quality of the bag isn’t lowered from being crushed."
3.0,You get what you pay for and these were cheaply built.
3.0,This band made my smart watch look real. The silver started to change color after 3 weeks of constant wearing.
3.0,"For 13 $, whatever. But you should state that it is in fact a barrett rather than an actual &#34;crown.&#34;"
3.0,A little larger than I wanted but it's working out OK.
3.0,"It's pretty and as described but the very first day I wore it the bottom gem fell off. It's alright, but be very gentle with it I guess."
3.0,"This was a really cute dress but barely covered my butt and rode up when i moved anywhere. I got the black without the tie, which was a lot tighter, and the navy with the tie which was my fav. Returned both.<br /><br />I got XL for both- I am 5'7'', 36/38D, 33 waist and 43 hips."
3.0,"Don't know why I bought it for, But whatever it would be put to good use ."
3.0,Makes your upper body look HUGE... and the color is not as vibrant as I expected.
3.0,Doesn't stay up so well
3.0,Love it but the zip sticks everytime I either try to open it or closw it
3.0,"These leggings are butter soft. They fit great, I just wish they were tighter around the tummy for support."
3.0,I sweat through these easily and they don't show enough cleavage.
3.0,Ball comes flat!
3.0,"too small, XL is like a small"
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this Actloe camo print pullover. It seems to fit accurately, however, it is somewhat stiff. I expected it to be cozy and soft, but the fabric is rather coarse. The colors are nice blue hues, though. There is a seam that runs the length of the middle of this pullover’s back, which is rather unusual. This could be irritating and annoying to some women, though. The long sleeves have a solid-color ribbing at the cuffs. There is also a solid color ribbing at the bottom of the pullover. This top is versatile, because it is fairly lightweight and could be worn through an assortment of seasons. It seems to be durable and well-made. Sadly, you have to hand wash and hang dry this top."
3.0,Bought these so I could wear pants tucked in on rainy days.  Doesn't work.
3.0,Love the Colors but its a little to small for me
3.0,Had to return because my wife didn't like it & didn't fut
3.0,Me gusto .lo recomiendo
3.0,it's cute but the chain is very weak so it broke. I can still wear it but it's very difficult to hook it on and it easily snaps off. I'm sad that it broke so easily but it's really cute I can't bear to throw it away.
3.0,it fits perfect material feels a little cheap but its okay still like it still comfortable
3.0,No variety.
3.0,Pros : they are nice looking<br />Cons: they are thin<br />They are stiff<br />You cannot sit down because they immediately pop off your pants because they have no stretch/give
3.0,"this s*** was everything i wanted but the only problem is that it was way too small. it did fit but it look like a little girls shirt. I will purchase this again in a bigger size. Besides this being too small, i am happy  with my purchase. the material is really soft and it looks like an authentic tommy shirt.<br />** i did receive this at a discounted price for my honest opinion but by no means did this influence my review"
3.0,"I bought two of these about a year about. I love them, they're light and fashionable. The only reason I am giving it three stars is because the recent one I ordered came in the wrong color. I ordered a dark gray and ended up with a purple hat. It's not a huge deal, I just wish I'd gotten the color i originally ordered."
3.0,"Very cute earrings.<br />Flimsy but cute.<br />Were too big for my liking (My fault).<br />But the reason I plan to return is the... &#34;stem?&#34; Of the earring. It's not centered so they &#34;hang&#34; as opposed to being... well centered lol.<br /><br />Idk, personal issue.<br />Not for me."
3.0,The item was great except it was too small. I gave it to my niece and she loves it.
3.0,"made of quality fabric, but runs small in size"
3.0,Didn’t look like what it expected
3.0,I do love how the earrings look on.  Delivery was excellent.  thank you much appreciated.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift, the romper is very cute. However, one of the buttons were broken."
3.0,Size is perfect and quality seems good. I just wish that it open more.  However it held my laptop a pair of shoes enough outfits for a weekend and toiletries. Of course I used a space saver bag for my clothes 👍
3.0,"This is a really pretty rose gold color and fits fine, but the balls on the end are way too big for my liking."
3.0,"These are good looking shoes for sure, but the comfort is level is questionable. I cannot wear it for the whole day, by the end of the day my sole hurts. I have always loved Puma for its comfort, I own 2 other pairs which are super awesome, but not this one. Another negative is the length of the shoelaces, it way too short IMO."
3.0,the bib goes up to high on the stomach impossible to take a leak easily without undoing.
3.0,I have long legs so...they do not come up to my knees. They are warm enough but they will not stay up on my legs so they are going to be used as socks not as non-skid slippers.
3.0,"it's a pretty bracelet but if you look closely the eyes are not painted right they look weird, but besides that the bracelet is nice and looks good."
3.0,I love the product it’s just my flowers fell off already …
3.0,"too wide for my watch, was nice quality."
3.0,"It is ok, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Very pretty also very delicate might be a one time use Item
3.0,I loved this but they broke
3.0,The product was OK however if you wish to return it they seem to give you a hard time with given your refund.
3.0,"Loved how the material felt, but stride was somewhat short. Also, after 1 wash (and laid flat to dry) the black part looked like it had been washed 50 times already. So, sadly, this was only worn once because of that fact."
3.0,this hat was a cheap and last minute purchase. it did the job for my costume but the front part of the cap would not stay up and was not sturdy.
3.0,Loved the color. Liked the lining. Would have liked it better if the lining didn’t show under the upper body when lifting up the bell sleeves.
3.0,tight-fit
3.0,It runs quite large when I order the small size.  I have to return it. Sorry.
3.0,"Lacking a bit in quality, but my son loved them."
3.0,"El diseño es bonito solo que la piel no tiene una sensación al tacto que parezca realmente piel. Además, creo que por el precio de la bolsa debería al menos traer una bolsa para guardarla del polvo, pero no fue así."
3.0,"I measured myself multiple times and ordered based on what it said my size was and when it arrived it was wayyyy to small. I give it 3 stars because they were quick to offer a refund for the product and it did arrive on time, was the right color, and good quality. Just sad it didn’t fit"
3.0,"Material is a little scratchy and it's very thin. Its also a typical Chinese sizing issues.<br />Size 5/6 needs an extra large, lol."
3.0,pretty skirt but too small
3.0,"I love the shorts, there are two things that need improvement. The string is super long in XL, and the waist stretch bad folds over (yes I’m heavier) and begins to be a little too tight leaving markings."
3.0,"How ironic to receive reusable bags in a non-reusable cellophane bag! Could they have been packaged in recycled paper, for instance?"
3.0,This product did not come with the mesh at the sides as it is in the picture but the material is good!
3.0,Had to return this wallet because it was too pointy in the middle once the cards are placed inside. Although it looks sturdy but the way it was designed was not good.
3.0,Colors are darker than they appear in the photos.
3.0,"It’s cute but the straps are so long, they have to be taken in at least a couple inches"
3.0,"Just what I was looking for. Cheap sunglasses. These are sort of like very cheap reading glasses with a flat piece of tinted plastic, thin, for lenses. $12 seems a little bit highly priced."
3.0,"I'm 5'11 and 130lbs and got a Medium (should have gotten a small)<br /><br />This dress is really cute, but it runs large in the body while the arms are very slim. I'm probably going to return it for a small."
3.0,didn't have much padding at all. Returned it.
3.0,"Ok- this is one  of those items that looks really trendy and cool in the picture. But somehow when I got it and I put it on, it was just weird. The fabric was fine, it fit me fine, it was well put together… But I felt like I was wearing a costume from rogue one Star Wars.  It hung very strangely, and it just didn’t look right. I will leave it in my closet and probably wear it for some kind of Halloween costume at some point. It is not something that I would wear on an every day basis because it has a rather peculiar line and the asymmetrical hem is boxy and unflattering."
3.0,"Bags are a good size and you get a good number of them for the price. However, multiple zippers had issues and it was difficult to zipper them open and closed. Created a hassle to open and close the bags."
3.0,"Good case, but doesn't​ fit most aviators."
3.0,Wrong color sent. Fits fine and decent quality
3.0,It is ok. But it is a little bit small than I thought
3.0,"While these are pretty earrings, they are much smaller than the photos would lead one to believe. Also, the blue stone in the star dangle is a very faint color and does not stand out well — it really just blends in with the silver of the earrings. The worst thing, though, is that it’s quite difficult to get the clasp to close well. It took me five minutes of fiddling to get the clasp back in place so that I didn’t have to worry about losing the earring. Cute, but practical? Not too sure."
3.0,"No me agrado que una de las piezas no posee la talla solicitada, la etiqueta dice XL pero es más pequeñs"
3.0,"Love the top, but it's too fitted in the waist. Had to give it to one of my friends because it was too much trouble to return...took almost a month to receive it."
3.0,"Let me get this out of the way, these glasses , at least, the pair I received, are not polarized. I checked them with the circular polarizer from my camera kit.<br /><br />Since they're cheap glasses I had pretty low expectations for these glasses, which they met. They feel cheap, and their advertised features werent there - however, they fit well and survived a week of hiking in the woods as my only pair of sunglasses. The glasses survived well enough, however after about two hours of wearing them they would give me a horrible headache. I'm not really sure why; I've never had a problem with inexpensive glasses in the past.<br /><br />I ended up giving these to my fiance who has been wearing them regularly without any issues. If it wasn't for the teeny-tiny headache issue I would have kept them around because they're on trend with what the cool kids are wearing these days.<br /><br />For the price I'd snag a pair and see how they work out for you. They're an awful lot cheaper than a pair of Oakley Frogskins."
3.0,"It's nice enough, but I will have to have the hemline shortened as I prefer the hemline to come just below my knees."
3.0,These are really thin so don’t keep you warm which is the reason you bought them. Also they are a bit big (for a woman). You get what you pay for...
3.0,"It’s an ok hoodie. Fabric feels cheap. Was hoping for soft. Didn’t get it. Other than that? It’s a decent, inexpensive piece."
3.0,It is a little too slinky for me.. I like cotton nighties best.
3.0,pilling a bit after about 6 months. otherwise good.
3.0,Giving three stars because it's more suede than leather.  I was thinking it would be actual leather that can be wiped off or worn in the winter/rainy days.  Not crazy about the suede look!  Guess  Leatherette means suede.<br /><br />I'll update the review as time goes on and I get to wear them more.<br /><br />&#34;I received this product in exchange for an honest review&#34;.
3.0,Arrived a little deformed. Made cheap. Could of been packaged better. Came in a bag smashed. You get what you pay for.
3.0,I don't know who they were sizing for the arm holes. They are huge. I can wear a tank top under it and it works but if I did not want to then it does not. It's otherwise comfy. I kept the two dark colors and returned the lighter color. The lighter color was very thin and therefore see through.
3.0,The bracelet is not the well made.  It looks somewhat cheap.  We will see how long it holds up.....Not worth more than what I paid for it.  That is for sure.
3.0,"Bought for my sisters wedding on the beach. First pair broke the moment she tried them on (fixable broke, but still broke). We were glad we had bought the 4 pack so hopefully one of them will last for her wedding in a week."
3.0,"This top was pretty, but it was way too long.  This top was so long that it looked like a dress.  I sent it back."
3.0,"Well-made and true to size, but I really dislike the fabric. I was hoping for something soft and cozy, but it remained stiff and scratchy after multiple washes. If I wore a shirt underneath it it'd be fine, but I purchased it to be a lounge/pajama sweater, so it just doesn't suit my purposes."
3.0,"A little small under the arm. Mine came without a size tag and a large spot on it, but laundered out. The shipping bag was damaged and completely covered in large black dirty marks so I am assuming, spot was result from shipping, not seller. Took longer to arrive than stated at time of purchase. I do not know what size I have, but it fits small. I suggest buying a size larger anyway. Overall, I love the dress. Very comfy looking."
3.0,"Expected a slightly bigger fit like a blazer, the size chart is off by a bit. I'm not able to wear it but my gf will enjoy it"
3.0,I bought these before. And not sure if it’s the metal clasp vs plastic but they don’t hold tight. I am constantly adjusting it. They are cool patterns & that’s my only complaint
3.0,I don't know why it is called fleece! The material is incredibly thin so don't buy this thinking it will keep your child warm. It's more like a long sleeve shirt then a sweatshirt. Other then that it arrived on time and in great condition.
3.0,Nice fabric and product is as described. However they run short for me. I am 5'5 and they were above the anckle
3.0,Very cute necklace but you can’t wear it often. I wore it for 3 days straight and it broke in half and the pearls broke off
3.0,Color was off. More on a pale peach color.
3.0,they're super cute but the rubber band keeps coming off while I'm sleeping or changing shirts and it's a bit annoying....
3.0,"In order to scrunch up the sides to make these past length wearable, the string at the bottom is like a foot long & I have no idea what to do with the pull strings on the side so they don't hang down & trip me. The product came with no instructions about how to work with the side strings."
3.0,"Fits great, but It's see through!  My daughter had to wear shorts under it."
3.0,Very short short was expecting them to be a little longer in the larger size although they fit in the waist and legs.
3.0,The quality is good when it comes to the frames. The hinges are actually best than your average glasses. They pivot outward but also allow for extra give if your head is bigger/wider than most. The reason I returned them is that the lens part or face of the frames are oversized and I have a large head.
3.0,"Nice shorts, but a little shorter than I was expecting. Basically, I was hoping for the original M01 shorts, sans those front pockets. If aftco made these shorts with a little more room and maybe an inch longer, they'd have the perfect pair of shorts. It's the supplex nylon material that these and the M01 shorts are made of that I love. Also, some more colors would be nice and might distract from an almost 1980's high school football coach's shorts look (the length)."
3.0,"The front looks exactly like the picture, but parts of the other characters are cut out.  The back of the dress is similar to the front, with Poppy on it, but I have ""Trolls 2 World Tour"" in a complete different language."
3.0,"This goes a  but on the large side. But It looks very fashionable and im always getting compliments on it. As a person with a pixie cut, I lost a lot of hair heat, this really warmed my head."
3.0,"These socks are not cozy. They are thin and run on the small side. I wear a size 7m. I Don’t think anyone above a size 8 ladies could fit these socks. They’re just ok, but will be ok with slippers on or in the sofa. There’s no grip or raised print on the words."
3.0,My husband liked it and it reasonably well made but the size was much smaller then expected.
3.0,The box was too big!
3.0,Like the design but it is made poorly. There were pieces of thread hanging.
3.0,Good price and cute but unfinished ends snag my clothes. I actually gave my brother a hug and it snagged the suit coat he was wearing. I felt horrible. I took the 2 I purchased apart and used them for crafts.
3.0,The padding shifts around. There is also a very thin liner over the padding that came off in the wash.
3.0,So disappointed!! NOT 20mm and no instructions
3.0,"Good product, good quality, small make.<br />They BARELY fit my size 9 children and are comparable with the size 8s they had nearly grown out of.  They won't get much use from them before they outgrow them.  If I was in a store and tried them on I would have bought the next size up or not got them at all but given they were ordered and delivered and I can't find any at all in the shops being out of season we will make do till the winter stock starts coming in.  Not an utter disaster but not as good as I hoped and given they were on the dear side for what they were I was a little disappointed.  Very cute though."
3.0,I liked that it covers the intended area but it had flaws in material and it was thin.
3.0,The dress did not come with a button as expected. I believe it came off in transit or something of that sorts. I was unable to exchange it before my even since it was out of stock so I safety pinned it together and it worked fine. After one wash it shrank severely and is now too short to wear. It is a shame because it is very cute and perfect the first time I put it on.
3.0,"Design is pretty, sleek, and girly which I love.  The band is just a little too tight and cannot be adjusted,  I do not wear it all the time."
3.0,Order a size larger. The style runs a little small.
3.0,"My workplace provides M/L Bella canvas masks that fit perfectly on me. However when I ordered the same size here, they were too big. Now I know it’s because it shrinks in the wash. The small size really only fits kids or teens up to 16 I’d say."
3.0,"Ordered the size I wear. When I got them the shoes are too small. Gave them to my daughter, she likes them"
3.0,"The shape is cute and the posts are VERY long, but the stone is in no way pink. I'm actually pretty disappointed. It's white pearl/opal kind of color which is nice if that's what was expected.  But I got these thinking they were pink a pink stone in the elephants ear."
3.0,"This seems like a very well constructed shirt. It's a little heavier than I anticipated and at 5' 4"" it is long enough to just cover my crotch which is a perfect length for keeping me warm. But it is scratchy. I know there are fine merino wool products out there are are less irritating and was really expecting more from SmartWool. I have a real hourglass figure and would have to buy a larger size that is less flattering to fit my chest and hips."
3.0,"I used these to hook to a carabiner on my belt loop. One to hold two small items and one to hold a car key and a few others. Both are warped at this point. Snagging on anything permanently warped them both in a way that wouldn't happen to a usual ring so that hits on two points. The first is that the design is fairly prone to snags. The second is that, when stressed, the metal can't deform overly much and then return to its original shape."
3.0,I purchased 2 of these. I don't know why this one is so big.
3.0,I like these socks I wish the fit was more consistent.  Sometimes the pairs will stay on well and then the next pair will slip down at the end of the day.
3.0,The material is ok and its very short in width than what id expect for a shawl. Its half the width of my other shawls. I use these for wrapping my hair mostly and its not wide enough for that.
3.0,Shrunk 2 sizes after 1 wash
3.0,This band is similar to a rolex band. It fine and doesn't look cheap at all.
3.0,It’s a lot boxier and bigger than it looks in the picture. I thought it was going to have little more structure.
3.0,The skirt is huge but the sleeves in the shirt are weird
3.0,"Ordered the pink long sleeve. I didn't expect much from a cheap dress on Amazon, however it is not a v neck--more of a scoop neck."
3.0,The rings could be perfect if it comes with the cabochons.
3.0,"I wanted to love these. They are genuine silk and appear to be nice quality, but the sizing is off. My waist is 30""-31"", so I ordered my normal size (large); I could barely get these on. No way would they fit comfortably on anyone over 28""-29"". I sent these back and will be ordering the XL (possibly even the XXL for comfort)."
3.0,I have this dress in stripes and it's a dream. But this one has a costume-like sheen on it I wish it didn't have.
3.0,"Don't care for the ban on sewed on the sleeve.  I will tuck under when I wear.  Also do not care much for the black trim, I may take to a tailor and ha it removed.  Like the leopard chiffon fabric."
3.0,I'm 5'4 at 150lbs so thought the large would be roomy but they are snug. The label only says hand wash and for that much material it would take too long to dry. I like them but I'm ordering an XL for a more comfortable fit & the possible shrinkage when I wash them.
3.0,"The pants have a soft texture, medium thickness, and large fit. For reference, I'm 5 feet tall and 100 lbs; I drown in the XS pants. The pant legs double or triple my leg's size. The waist was for a 27 to 33 inch waist, although there is a drawstring. The pant's inseam is 30-31 inches, for someone 5 feet 2 inches tall to 5 feet 4 inches tall. Overall, the XS pants may be a better fit for a person with 120-160 lbs, 27-33 inch waist, 5'2""-5'4"" height. It is a poor fit on a petite person like me and so I return immediately. I'm grateful to order via Amazon Prime with free returns, instead of ordering directly from Fair Indigo, losing time waiting for the merchandise to arrive, losing time returning it and getting a refund minus the $6 shipping cost. I wish Fair Indigo would offer clothes for petite women or for children."
3.0,Fits smaller than expected. I am usually an XL which generally leaves me breathing room. This fits more like a Large and is a tad snug around the mid section.
3.0,Not true to fit runs big but good quality
3.0,Loved these! But one fell of and lost it. Ordering again and buying extra backing so they won’t fall off
3.0,"Nice dress. The length is above the knee. I'm 5'6 tall. Its a little too short for me. It's a little big at the top portion of the dress. In the back it closes with interwoven ribbons instead of a zipper. I would have preferred a zipper. The ribbons are off white, which I gather is to match the off white under the blue lace. This dress needs a little work. But it's a nice idea of a dress."
3.0,"I love the glasses, however ,  the glasses, bag, and case, all smell like smoke !  I am trying  to  air them out more but if not I will be returning  them."
3.0,The charm is very nice and readable however the chain is not so durable.
3.0,"The fit of these is good. The sizing is pretty accurate. The material is light weight and comfortable against the skin. The waist band is too thin and doesn't feel like it will stay in place long. I haven't had any problems with the waist band slipping, but I just don't have any confidence in it. The construction is fine. I just find these to be okay."
3.0,i bought light champagne to match with bride who will wear ivory dress. The dress was darker.. much darker than the picture. i will return the dress.
3.0,Runs a little small but still not bad
3.0,"Look cute, they are a hard cheaper plastic but they are cute and serve their purpose!"
3.0,These pants are ok. Probably more suited for someone smaller/thinner. I feel like they are just too tight for me compared to other brands. They seem to be made well. Just skin tight and hard to get on and a too tight when you sit. The pockets are great though. They are deep and hold a phone nicely. Probably more so than other brands.
3.0,"Cute dress, well sewn but tailored a little odd. Size chart does not match bust size of dress. I had to pull the seams on the sides so it would fit."
3.0,they were really tight but i really like them
3.0,It was large and really no shape to them. It was long on me so I had 3 inches cut off.
3.0,I’m 5’3” I way 190. I purchased the xl and they fit perfect. My iPhone 11 Pro fits in the pocket completely. Only problem is they aren’t fleece lined. The title says fleece lined but apparently some aren’t. I bought the pink ones. If you don’t care about the fleece these are great leggings. If you want fleece avoid these or read very carefully cause apparently  there is only like 4 colors that are fleece lined.<br /><br />To the seller...you really shouldn’t  mix fleece lined with non fleece lined and title it “fleece lined”
3.0,Snagged easily after first wear - I wore it to the office. Beautiful garment but you have to be very careful with it.
3.0,"So very beautifully designed, but i believe it should have been the word aqua not agau..... i just now realized this months later hahaha"
3.0,Material feels kinda heavy and pills .
3.0,"Updating this review after one week of wearing.  Still love the look, but the plain ones will not stay closed.  They just will not click closed and I am very frustrated.  I may have to return them.  But, I love the ones with the stones.<br /><br />Just received them yesterday so I don't know how they will hold up, but they look great and I love how they hug the ear and are small and delicate looking, not big and chunky."
3.0,"The pictures really made this watch look classy, and it is. However, there are a few things going on that you don’t see till you strap it on. The first thing is the bulky leather strap. It’s thin in width and looks great with the size of the crystal on top but when you turn to the side you see the extra bulk of the strap when buckled. This might not bother some, but if you love ultra thin watches, the band thickness is as important to the look as the case. I think this is why most minimalist watches use mesh bands instead of leather. However, the leather band is what attracted me to this watch. Also, the calendar date on the dial is bright white, while the rest in all black, making the watch look like it has a spec of debris on it. Honestly, I think this watch would be best served with a darker color calendar date( even if it’s harder to see) or just leave it off completely. Outside of those issues that bother me, this watch is nice and a great value. Hope this helps."
3.0,I wanted this to hold a child's sunglasses but they are too large- they are regular sized (but came up in my search for kids sunglasses case)
3.0,works ok a little scratchy against skin
3.0,Somewhat clingy..will probably need to go a size up for room.
3.0,It's a very pretty dress BUT I ordered the size she wore and it is to big to were the back will be completely closed up. It wasn't as long as I expected it to be. I was wanting floor length not ankle.
3.0,I got the pink color thinking it was a bright and lighter pink... When it came it was more of a dusty pink making it look more salmony than the picture:(
3.0,Decent quality. Smaller than the original Oakley. Shipping was a little slow
3.0,Love the top. But .. has an elastic at the bottom that it didn't say in the description.. which isn't too bad...but the neckline doesn't really allow for falling off the shoulder..too narrow an opening.. still deciding if I'm keeping it...update...sent it back...
3.0,It's ok for price. Doesnt look real cheap its ok
3.0,"Very cute shirt with bright colors, but it was a little stiff."
3.0,Like the style and the way they fit my face.  Only reason for the three stars is because they fogged up within 20 minutes of the first use.  I have some anti fog spray but supposedly wasn't supposed to need it.  More pros than cons for me though.  Still like them.
3.0,"Average tank top.  Good color, but a little snug."
3.0,The hood was too short to go over my head - like it was sewn for someone with no neck. I wear a large so bought a XXL but it was still a little snug - I would have kept it though except for the hood being too short :(
3.0,It's ok. A bit fragile and the Sri Tantra engraved is not very detailed. But feels good to wear it and have the sri yantra on me all the time.
3.0,"fine for the gym. A bit flimsy, but very soft"
3.0,"I'm a guy of moderately above average size (six foot tall and stocky), and find the band length ungenerous (have to let the band almost all the way out). Also, the band plastic seems cheaper than other Casios (dryer looking/feeling and less supple). The watch body is a little small (although the numerals/letters are decent sized). The back light is horrible (all the light is concentrated on the left side, have to look at the display at a pronounced angle to see anything). I wore it for a day; my much better FE10 arrived the same day; won't be wearing this one much (if ever). Finally, this watch arrived in packaging (including a thick owners manual) for a very different (solar powered no less) Casio watch; the seller didn't even bother to mount the watch to the stand, just putting it to one side of the stand in a plastic bag. Dear Reseller: please throw away your empty garbage boxes yourself."
3.0,"The long owl watch pendents that I ordered from Amazon are very cute and have a vintage look to them. The chain is nice and heavy as well as the pendent itself, not cheap looking at all. However, BOTH pendents have dead batteries! I have ordered 5 other watch related items all with working batteries. Bummed."
3.0,I bought this for my 92-year old Mother who is often cold.  It is not bad but could be a little heavier.
3.0,Really liked these but the metal isn’t true stainless steal because after a week they began to hurt my ears
3.0,I really liked this...it is super cute. Flowers are a tad bit big but the deal breaker was the area where the post and flower were attached (soddered??) caused irritation to my tragus.
3.0,"I liked this suit but the top is too small,  bottoms fit fine. Top is probably fine for smaller breasted women but I am a 36 C & could not zip it up. If you want to wear it un-zipped, it would work. Had to return it because a larger size would have been way to big on bottom."
3.0,I would not buy this again
3.0,"Came quickly.  Fit well. However,  during my dance, beads came off. This was the first time I wore it, dance in it."
3.0,"Items arrived nicely and were boxed much like jewelry. The gray and black one have had no problems and are very comfortable. The silver one, on the other hand, is just painted silver and after one day of just wearing it around the office, the paint started wearing off and making the ring very unsightly. So if you are considering any of the KeepFit silicone rings, I would shy away from the metallic looking ones."
3.0,The clasp repeatedly comes open on 1 side or the other. Spent the day reattaching it.
3.0,"I love the length and wood look & feel. But it wasn't as blue as the picture at all. I will keep it because I like them, but they are a dark navy and I expected more of royal dark blue."
3.0,"3 stars for comfort, but at first I thought I got a kids size.  I'm a 5'3"" 105lb female and ordered a small. It just fit. Not real roomy, and barely covers my rear. I have a couple of Baja hoodies in size small, and they all have the loose and baggy fit that these are meant to have. Thought these were unisex, but no way would this fit a guy. I'm keeping it cause it's still okay comfort wise. If it shrinks when laundered, then I'll be out of luck. Would I order again? Probably not."
3.0,"The print on this light weight scarf it lovely, however it is done in a raised rubbery material that is on top of the scarf. It doesn’t go through the matieral so only one side shows the true colo, & the texture is odd. It feels like a version of the tread on non-slip socks."
3.0,"I liked the material, it felt almost like denim. But when I went by the sizing chart, I ordered a large instead of a medium. The large was very loose around the chest and waist area. Thank God there was a place to tie it like a corset in the back! But if I felt like going through the stress of returning the item, I would have purchased a medium instead. For me, the item was larger than expected. But it was still a cute dress!"
3.0,I am not sure if this is one size fits all ... I am 5'5 and weigh 135 lbs and I dont see this fitting anyone else bigger then my size.
3.0,"Though this was a cute pair and based off on Miyazaki's film, they just looked cheap upon arrival. I wouldn't mind buying a pair that didn't have off color patterns."
3.0,"Way too small. The &#34;knees&#34; like 5&#34; lower, and i'm 5'2&#34;. Didn't want to go through returning hassle, so im wearing them lime long socks."
3.0,Pretty. But a little big. And made my ears itch a bit.
3.0,Breaks easily but it's cute.
3.0,Doesn’t look like the picture..smaller and shorter than I thought it would be. A good beach cover up dress.
3.0,"To be perfectly honest, the quality of this item is good and you will love it if you are a fan of vintage washed style as well a fan of Tiger Woods. However, this hat is definitely not from ETW (Tiger’s company) so Amazon should make sure it’s not a counterfeit. That’s why I gave it a three star (could be 5 if it’s legit)."
3.0,"It bunched up really awkward in the back of the dress. The material is thin, you must wear something underneath. The pattern was nice."
3.0,more of a novelty than a serious watch
3.0,I love the pants and they are so comfy but I noticed there was a hole in the crotch of the pants 😢
3.0,"Really cute but I ordered my normal boot size and they're way too big, slip off feet big. Might return :/"
3.0,Runs big and color is much different than the picture
3.0,"I am a size 18 and put this on and the arms were baggy and loose(and I have big arms), it was weird ..the top was too short and not made for girls with big belly's and big boobs! Returned but it was nice material. Only if it was more fitted I would have kept it!"
3.0,This is MUCH smaller than it says it is.
3.0,"It's nice, but it really shrinks in the wash. I wanted to use it as a dress, but it shrunk so much that I can't anymore."
3.0,"There are no handles, and there is no mention that handles are extra or even what type of handle needs to be purchased along with the items"
3.0,"I like this dress, but it’s not at all what I expected. It fits a little large and is longer than in the photo. It didn’t give me the sexy silhouette that the photo shows. It’s a very stretchy material and with the rusching on the side, this looks much like a maternity dress. It’s very comfortable and is cute, but is better suited as a casual basic dress than one for a night out, although it is short.<br /><br />Update: after wearing it twice, it has a hole midway down from pulling it down so often. It’s short but somehow also rides up on me, making it too short as I wear it. Had to change my 4 starts to 3 stars."
3.0,"Too form fitting for my standards, but otherwise is a nice product."
3.0,"This bra fits well, and support is good, but there is stitching completely around the chestband that cuts into the skin and is rather uncomfortable."
3.0,love ... love... love it ....its looks so cute with summer outfits
3.0,"Cardboard soles with flimsy foam insoles over them.<br /><br />Let that sink in. These boots would be good for cosplaying or light wear around the office or outside, but I wore them on a four day larp and DESTROYED them. The insoles and soles disintegrated. They have no padding or support other than a flimsy piece of foam over literal cardboard, it's so thin you'll feel every pebble on the sidewalk. I'm going to be making my own replacement soles but I would recommend against getting these if you don't want to have to do a lot of work to keep them wearable.<br /><br />On the upside, they look really nice and are comfortable if you only wear them inside or around a city. I've received a lot of complements about them, and do plan on keeping them, even with their myriad issues."
3.0,The pants were too tight on my thighs but fit everywhere else and ripped the first time I wore them. Love the shirt !!!
3.0,"My wife loves this, but she has had it a couple of months and is already showing signs of wear. The stitching is coming loose an the little snap flap thing and one of the loops for the strap broke off."
3.0,"Because of how these are sewn, they really don't show much of the design nor look like the photos in the listing. They're small on my face, so I don't think they'd work anywhere much talking is required. They also smell incredibly disgusting out of the package, like bad body odor. I'm hoping that is taken care of by a run through the washing machine. Would not purchase these again."
3.0,"I feel like they were tight in the wrong places. The fabric is not like &#34;jeans: at all. The fabric is soft and comfortable. The fit is off.<br />other than that, they are fine."
3.0,They are not the same as what I ordered.  They are grey and black. There isn't any copper color to them that is why I did order them.  However they are lightweight.  Also said they would be sent in a Pammy J protective box and they doi not. More than likely I will request a refund. Still thinking about possibly gifting instead of keeping for myself.
3.0,"These pants are comfortable but the legs are a little short.  I am 5'6"" and weigh 132 lbs.  I ordered a medium.  These came barely to the top of my ankles.  Having a cuff, I would have thought they would have added a little more length avoiding them from riding up when you sit."
3.0,Lovely dress but was disappointed that the dress  was spandex
3.0,"The item arrived on time, and as described.  The only problem is that after the first wearing, there are now broken threads.  It makes me wonder how long these will last."
3.0,Cute shirt however the size runs small. My daughter is 10 and usually wears 12-14 children’s size.  This just fit and washed -did NOT dry and it still shrunk.  Donation bag it went
3.0,"These arrived very fast. Read all the reviews, and expected missing gems and scratches. They indeed had a few missing gems and star was chipped and off positioned. I'm not mad because I expected it. They are nice to block some sun."
3.0,I like everything about this jacket except for the zipper which might be a deal breaker. It not only has the active part on the left like a woman's (wind flap is also on left which is correct for a man's jacket) also it is made of plastic which would be OK if it was of good quality and worked smoothly but it does not. It sticks  every few inches and has to be coaxed all the way up (goes down OK) Still deciding whether to send it back or not.
3.0,Arrived late!  Are cute but too long fit in leg (Goes above the knee). Compression support is very minimal.
3.0,"It isn't quite windbreaker light weight, but really would not provide much more than a fashion statement as for as coats are concerned. The fit is fine and makes for a good cover. The length runs between mid thigh and knee on my wife (5'6""), it would be a little tight buttoned, but I doubt she will ever button it as that is not how these things are worn (she says, as I have little sense in women's fashions &lt;g>). She would have liked the green to be a tad darker, it tends toward an emerald green.<br /><br />The washing instructions are gentle wash in cold water and line dry so I have to expect shrinkage or limited durability if you tumble dry."
3.0,Neck and pendant don’t have the same color and the claps on the necklace came faded and it’s suppose to be stainless steel. It doesn’t look that nice the necklace looks super cheap but the pendant looks okay and shiny.
3.0,Their ok nice
3.0,Good quality but it’s not made for longevity.
3.0,Very pretty  - looks better on me tucked in.
3.0,"Not a fan of fake distressing, but the sleeve detail of this dress caught me.  I'm 5'4"" size 10 and got the Medium.  Top fits well, sleeves do narrow at wrist, but with the overall volume of this dress, folding or pushing them up lessens the overwhelming size.  It has nice deep pockets. The medium weight denim fabric is more stiff than soft, and adds to the volume.  I'm on the fence as to whether to keep or return.  It's comfortable, but I feel lost in it.  Makes me look and feel enormous.  ... No longer on the fence - I have to return it."
3.0,"These are okay cheap sunglasses, but quite large. These would be fine for men, or if you have a larger head. I do like the navy blue color - it's unique, but not obnoxious. These work as spare sunglasses to keep in the car, or to take on a trip to the river - when you don't want to lose or break your good sunglasses. But, if you have a smaller head, they may not fit at all."
3.0,"These pants do not fit me as they do the model. I have a pretty much hourglass shape and bought the large. These are snug at the waist and so loose around my calves, then more fitted at the ankles. Maybe I'm too short (5'6)? If I wear the ankle holes pulled down under my heels, it looks a bit less bizarre."
3.0,I bought this for an upcoming costume event.  It’s really a great idea.  Unique and not just another generic necklace.  It showed up in a nice box but was already broken.  One of the chains was detached.  Kind of a let down considering I was planning on wearing it for an entire evening.  I doubt it’s going to hold up.
3.0,"This is pretty enough, but super super small. If you have any cleavage at all, I would steer clear of this."
3.0,"The pair I received had a manufacturing defect.  The locking mechanism on the adjustment clasp was actually installed backwards.  Using pliers, I corrected the problem but I feel that it was something that should not have been missed and passed on to a customer.  Once the clasp was corrected, the garters worked fine."
3.0,"These are well made, but heavy on the ear."
3.0,most of them have broken in my mouth. the stone or graphic on top comes off easily
3.0,"Somewhat too large. Bought a large. I wear size 10, 12 sometimes. Item is a flannel type material. Very 'linty'. Larger than expected.<br />Been wearing this for about 2 months now. Very comfy, despite the size. Washed several times and the color is still great. The 'lint'/shedding went away after a couple of washes. Great for winter weather."
3.0,Very cute shoes but at least 2 sizes too big!
3.0,It's plastic not metal.
3.0,"I ordered 2 different dresses, the same size 10, from the same HOMEYEE company. One dress fits very good. This grey  dress is nice, but doesn't match the specified size, too small, definitely not a size 10. Returned it."
3.0,"Too short! I'm 5'10&#34; and this dress skins the top of my ankles, otherwise the fit was good. I ordered an XL but returned because I like my dresses below my ankles."
3.0,"The watch works well & looks nice.  The necklace is very cheap looking as is the chain on the watch.  The ring is also cheaply made.  However, this was a purchase for a 13 year old who is very rough so not spending a lot of money was what we needed for this."
3.0,I bought my usual size and I couldn’t even pull them up. Probably needed to order 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,"The material is comfortable, the pattern is good (snow leopard) and I had no difficulty attaching the band to my watch. Unfortunately it is too large for my wrist, causing the watch to slide around too much. For reference, my wrist size is approximately 6 1/2 inches."
3.0,"It may just be me and where my eyes are in relation to the rest of my face, but these are hard to wear the bifocal transition makes it awkward unless I am either looking straight ahead or slightly up or directly down at a book or my phone. Any mid-level gaze is very blurry and extremely uncomfortable."
3.0,"The fit and style is great, the fabric feels nice... BUT they are 100% see-through. You pretty much have to wear a tiny thong or no undies at all, you can see everything. The seams have also already started to unravel in some places. I guess you get what you pay for. I gave this 3-stars bc of the smooth fabric. If it wasn't called a &#34;yoga&#34; pant it might work for lounging; definitely not for yoga or any other heavy workout."
3.0,"I'd have preferred silver to match the hardware on my purse. Bad enough I'll have to dye the handles red. Well, it is leather and well-backed with cloth. And a wonderful idea, offering such a replacement."
3.0,"it was defective, the shoulder strap is twisted I couldn't fit it"
3.0,The neck is weird on this. It's almost like it was cut wrong
3.0,"Color is on point.<br />Doesn't take well to iron, bangs get in the way and there is no defined hairline. Un-usable."
3.0,I am 5’10 about 136.  This was a little wide… and short.  Sleeves were short too.  It was ok…. Served it’s purpose but definitely not a favorite.
3.0,"Pros: Jewelry set had very cute packaging, sparkly costume jewelry<br /><br />Cons: too chunky for my taste, looks a little cheap quality"
3.0,"Overall, it's cute. I'm only 5'0 and it doesn't look ridiculously long on me like many sweaters do. I wish the neckline was made a little better. It's hand wash only which can be a pain. The fabric is surprisingly soft. I'm not sure if I'm the right person to wear this. The first time I wore it, I was told I looked like I was ready to go teach my first day of first grade. So take that as you will."
3.0,great band but it has the &#34;Barbie&#34; logo on it which I didn't know about.
3.0,"Inside color is white not red plaid. So you see white when it flips up.  Cheap, thin polyester. OK for costume, but not really as I'd expected."
3.0,Needs to have some sort of button to secure the liner sleeve to the shell sleeve.
3.0,"This was a part of a gift. It definitely wasn’t really well made. It served its purpose but, I most likely wouldn’t purchase this item again. You get what you paid for."
3.0,I like the shirt but the Elvis w/guitar fades really quick. It also shrinks more than other shirts so it doesn't last for long.
3.0,Girlfriend liked it however it seems to be thinner than 3mm for some reason. Other than that it gets the job done.
3.0,The material felt a lot cheeper than I imagined but it will work.
3.0,"THEY ARE SO CUTE, but they look like 00's or 0's can't fit them into 2's"
3.0,"One band broke after a couple weeks. The metal clasp disconnected from the band and exposed a sharp, rusted piece of metal."
3.0,Cute but very stiff and very shiny!! Looks like the pictures.
3.0,"NOT ATHLETIC APPAREL 😕 while these are very comfortable for yoga, I wouldn't normally wear them. Will probably end up being travel/lounge wear. Disappointed as they are more legging than athletic wear.<br /><br />Fits well, I didn't have any issues with waist or calf seams. The length is great."
3.0,This tshirt is narrow at the hips so it bunches up. It’s really obnoxious.
3.0,I ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas. Much to my and HIS dismay it does not come with a battery. And I cannot find the battery for it.
3.0,It was okay. I thought they would be a little thicker but still quite nice.
3.0,Material thin and see through. Not as nice as I expected.
3.0,very wrinkled and hard to come out
3.0,No me gusta la tela es muy finita
3.0,"Loved the style and fit, the material is just to thin and clingy. I’m in my 70s so it’s not my best look 😊"
3.0,"It's really flexible and felt a lot better then the steel one I had, but my skin did not react the it well and it got irritated so I had to remove it."
3.0,Material is soft & the print is very clear but it is much thinner than expected. Returned it because the stitching started coming undone in several places.
3.0,"The sweater is cute, but material is pretty cheap. The fleece part is much thinner than I expected."
3.0,Very pretty but the large fits like a small .
3.0,"Evidently I misunderstood the part about fitting children and adults.  That should have been my first clue. This is for a small child only.  I bought this to be a Cheshire Cat and ended up taking the headband apart to separate the ears and totally dismantled the tail.  For an adult, well, it just doesn't do it.  I split the tail and sewed it into one long tail.  Bought a striped tee and pulled the tail through a hole strategically placed in the back.  I attached the tail with a pin to my leggings.  As for a child using it, not sure how you'd attach the tail but a creative person would figure that out. The tail is bulky and curved as it should be for a Cheshire Cat but tricky to keep in place.  Hey, it was inexpensive and after a bit of sewing it worked. Just watch it when they say fits children through adults, my mistake."
3.0,I put them on the edge of my purse I put one on my keychain they break off easy so be gentle with them if you buy them
3.0,Much longer than I expected. The top was just not flattering. I'm 5'4&#34; and 135 lbs. This was just not a good fit. I returned.
3.0,"I like how these are supposed to look. However, when I put them on, the back part seems to face more forward. It’s hard to see the front of the earrings. I’ve tried putting them on the other way (backwards) and they actually seem to show better but still looks odd from certain angles, plus the clasp type closure isn’t the easiest tot work with. They are pretty though. 925 stamped sterling. I have since gotten a different pair of a different dangle style and it’s been working out much better for me."
3.0,"Kinda cool, but definitely not worth the price."
3.0,"Cute dress, but it's a little heavy. It was also very short. I am 5' 10.5&#34;"
3.0,They are flimsy and cheaply made.  There is a reflection inside the lens.
3.0,Cute watch but it is wider than I was expecting.
3.0,The purse was not as usable as the reviews stated. The zipper placement is odd. The leather look handle is a couple of inches too short and it’s obviously poor grade material. I would not buy again.
3.0,adhesive wears off immediately
3.0,Bought for a friend. Very pretty
3.0,These are WAY shorter than the FP shorts. Had to return. Even sized up
3.0,The front of these shoes are narrow and caused my daughter to have blisters.
3.0,It was okayyy
3.0,I love the style of this dress. It fits the upper body very well.  PROBLEM. The flare of the dress is down to my ankles making the dress 2 feet too long.  Plus the  stretchy nylon thread is coming loose in the front.  Very disappointed.
3.0,"The wood turnings were nice but the horn was cracked and splitting on the large end, it was cheap for a reason."
3.0,"This product is NOT linen as described. I wear a size 12 and ordered a large. The shirt was too small more like a size 8/10, had to give it to give it to a person that wears a size 6."
3.0,"They aren't bad. The cotton is nice and soft. But the lace can be annoying. I'm an XL and I purchased an XL and they just don't fit my butt right.<br />Not baby pouch friendly. My baby weight does not agree with these. The lace digs into my stomach a bit.<br />They aren't really that bad, but they are arent a good fit for me."
3.0,I Got A Large Because After Reading The Reviews They Said It Ran Small. I’m 5’5 & I Am 165 Lbs. A Medium Wouldve Been A Perfect Fit.
3.0,Aretes que tienen un buen lejos… pero de cerca parecen muy falsos. En mi caso no tolero más de un día este arete por el material que está hecho. Tiene buen precio y si tú oreja no es sensible al material económico es una buena opción!  (En mi foto se aprecia la gomita que está verde!
3.0,Really soft and nice dress. Only negative is it is pretty thin and see through. I ordered in black.
3.0,These are probably only nice on thin leg ladies. unless you like your fat pouring out where the stockings end 🙂
3.0,I ordered my actual size M and the dress is too loose.
3.0,"Kind of too roomy, Waist and length size fit well but through out the pants are big. but the pants are good quilty."
3.0,"I like the fit, width, and design. But the paisley rubbed off after just three days of normal wear on one of my rings. The design on the other rings didn’t even last that long because of how often I wash my hands and use hand sanitizer at work."
3.0,This shirt is soft and very pretty.  I gave three stars only because it is a very short torso shirt (not like the picture imply).  I do not have a big bust so that isn't the reason at all.  I had to give the shirt to my daughter.  I bought an extra large too.  The shirt is really pretty though.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest review.
3.0,"This bag can only hold your wallet, your phone , a pen, & some lip goss....The pic was a little misleading....I thought it was large....check the measurements....they're in cm. Its good when you don't want to carry you &#34;full&#34; purse."
3.0,Material is meshy and not a tight knit nylon like you'd see in department stores.
3.0,"neckline isn't very comfy, but nice dress."
3.0,"I ordered the pink. It was a sheer waffle type fabric. It would need something underneath to be worn in public. I went up a size according to the size chart given,  for an oversized fit, yet it was much too small. XL fits like a M in the body. The sleeves are very long. The seller went above and beyond in the return process."
3.0,Nice but not stretchy at all
3.0,There is a slit on the side of the shirt and it does go up pretty high
3.0,The quality could be some much better and the tailoring for the hodie is no great also the sizing for this hoodie is also garbage.
3.0,"Can you say, &#34;I'm a dork?&#34; If you actually wear these you won't have to, the world will say it for you. They look semi-normal in the ad, but when I took them out of the package and saw them for real, well they're big. They are also very yellow and strangely shaped, at least for human heads. They might work for intergalactic travelers though."
3.0,It keeps opening in my packet
3.0,"Received glasses in the mail and checked quality. A little annoyed with the fact these arrived warped. Set them down on a flat surface and they wobble around. They also do not sit on the face evenly. The do not, unfortunately fit my face well. They're too big or not angled enough to wrap around and flow with my face well. The lenses are very dark, which I prefer. Frame quality appears to be good. The eartips, starting from the temple, is made of plastic and may possibly be broken, but if there was anything to impact these enough to break that plastic, the frames would bend or lenses would pop out. They arrived well wrapped, lenses protected, and had a protective cloth bag, also with microfiber cleaning rag.<br /><br />In short, item arrived warped. They do not fit evenly on the face. They do seem to be built with quality though."
3.0,This wound up being too small for my daughter. But I was able to use it as a Christmas gift for a family member.
3.0,Appears to be well made but way too small! will be returning.
3.0,"It was very hard to find an accessory to match the color of a  magenta blouse that I had.  These earrings will do because, there is an hint of magenta color. The deep blue color can also work with magenta. I just wish the earrings were bigger but, this fine too."
3.0,Sleeves of hoodie shrunk extremely after I washed it
3.0,Cute shoes<br />*update*<br />The bow fell off after 8-10 wears
3.0,The straps don't last.
3.0,"The frames flex, which is nice because they are small!  Good for the kids."
3.0,"Larger than I thought, so they don't look as retro. Light weight, but at least they are inexpensive."
3.0,Over all I like it.
3.0,"very cute dress, fit as expected.  material is very thin so I don't expect this dress to last very long.  Ran it through a wash and the fabric must be removed from the dryer immediately or the wrinkles are a pain to iron out."
3.0,"Fits nicely, did not like the style as much as I thought I would. Material is kinda thin"
3.0,I ended up sending it back - not really what I expected
3.0,..wished it had more pockets..besides that. It’s nice.
3.0,Picture is nice but the fit is so off! Thighs are smaller but the waist is soooo big! Too big in fact. I had to give them away to a friend who can sew well.very disappointing
3.0,I ordered a large which is what I wear normally. Sometimes a medium.  This product runs very small! I would order 2 sizes larger than normal size.
3.0,"Luce bien, pero queda muy apretado, y el número corre pequeño."
3.0,Unable to us to large for my Versa
3.0,Love the color on me but fits kind of sung
3.0,"Pretty print and runs true to size. However, if you have any chest, this style may not work for you. I’m 5’2” and 105 lbs with 32DD chest. My boobs were spilling out!!"
3.0,Nice purse but the description is wrong.  It doesn’t have the two slip pockets which is disappointing. I’m learning you can’t rely on the descriptions to be accurate.
3.0,Runs small!  fabric looks a little cheap... and it runs a little too short
3.0,For the price these socks were a good buy. They are not uncomfortable. Beware they will shrink a lot at high temps though.
3.0,Roll down; there is no control top
3.0,"The boots themselves look nice, HOWEVER the strings were frayed and extremely dirty and look very obviously used or as if they had been run over by a car. I am going to buy new strings since I cannot even lace up the boots without putting tape around the string end, but its irritating because I shouldnt have to. The boots themselves are very cute."
3.0,It says high wast but it barely comes to my belly button. They are small...I ordered one size up and wish I did 2 sizes up. They are cute on and comfortable on the skin.
3.0,"Looks good, size runs small"
3.0,This heart in a bottle is pretty. My wife loved it.
3.0,Size is not as expected and seems the nanufacturer needs to align with international sizings. The stuff was also not good.
3.0,"They look cool and they are certainly conversation pieces for occasions like July 4th. But they are not what I would classify as &#34;large&#34; sunglasses and they certainly aren't the sort of shades you'll want to wear for their effectiveness. All in all, they are snug fitting on my big dome, but they are cool for the dough."
3.0,Runs small... But good quality
3.0,"Beautiful design but more of a flat pink color. Not anything close to what is pictured in color, which bummed me out bc i was looking for the magenta/purple hue not pink."
3.0,"I definitely have other better quality leather earrings, but paid more for them too.  I likely won't wear all from this package as a couple colors were not what I expected, and a couple just ""look cheap"" - HOWEVER, if you think you'll wear even 1 or 2 from this package of 8, then I recommend and it's worth it.  Great value for the price you pay!"
3.0,Smaller and thinner fabric than expected
3.0,"The emblem is VERY crooked. This was a gift for senior pictures and I’m disappointed in it. Otherwise, it seems fine."
3.0,It’s hit and miss with our cats..  Sometimes they use it.  Other times they walk by and lay elsewhere.
3.0,"My husband picked this out for Easter and to be honest, the quality could definitely improve.  The material is on the thinner side, so for us, price point does not match."
3.0,Good concept. Does the job but should be under $10.
3.0,"I'm super confused about these pants. I already own a pair that fit me great (same size), that I bought from Marshalls. I loved them so much that I decided to buy more Ci Sono pants on Amazon for work. For some reason, this pair has some really weird measurements. The legs are too small and the waist is very large. I am very confused because I bought the exact same size that I bought from the store! What the heck?! It's a drastic difference in sizing..."
3.0,"I love the look, but it broke the first time I wore it.  I tried to repair it, but it broke again and I lost the link.  I'm sad that I can't wear it anymore."
3.0,"Ordered a small. 5' 2&#34; , 125 lbs<br /><br />Tunic length is good.  Material quality is good.  It pulls up oddly on the front of the chest every time I move.  I will be returning it if possible."
3.0,"These gloves are nicely made, although I haven't worn them outside in really cold weather.  This is the third pair of lined leather touchscreen gloves I've purchased (review is by Dana, not Joseph, BTW).  I returned the previous pairs because although the size was good for my small/medium hands, the finger length was way too long - like more than a half inch too long.  This pair's finger length is still not ideal (a bit less than a half inch beyond the tip of my fingers) but I don't think I'd have enough comfort room in the hand/palm area in a smaller size.  Anyhow, if you don't have super short fingers the gloves will probably fit a small/medium hand well.  The touchscreen feature does work, but again, if my fingertips actually reached the end of the fingers of the gloves, I'm sure my accuracy using the touchscreen on my smartphone would be greatly improved."
3.0,"Dress and pattern came as expected, size fit as expected. The material is thick and slightly heavy, which is good because it is not see-through but can be hot on summer nights."
3.0,"It is really cute dress and fit very well except that it is a bit on the short side. That being the case the slit in the back made things very...breezy, if you know what I mean.  The quality isn’t top notch but for the price it’s really cute. I’m going to try it with leggings in the fall maybe that will work."
3.0,"I ordered normal size I wear, but slightly more narrow than other styles Easy Spirit offers."
3.0,"While it did seem to be pretty well made, it took some adjusting to get the mount lined up to work. If you are unlucky enough to not have much chin this might not work for you. The bottom jaw of the mask moves with your chin while talking. One side was cut differently than the other, allowing more natural skin to be seen. Might want to make up the lower part of your face and your neck for best appearance. Roomy for most sized heads."
3.0,"Work fine, wore for about 2 weeks before it broke, glad it was inexpensive and has backups, fun for 11 yr old"
3.0,Pretty earrings but the posts are way too big...  I have worn them just not often because I feel like they slide too much... maybe if you have really thick ears they would probably be fine.
3.0,"When I received the ring, the last crystal on the tail had fallen out. It was in the little plastic bag with the ring. I got some glue, a magnifier, tweezers and tooth picks. I was able to glue the little piece back in. It was a gift for my daughter.  It’s been a few weeks and she hasn’t said anything about it. All’s well that ends well….."
3.0,"Gray is NOT a heathered gray as pictured. The close-up images are more accurate. Pretty plain shirt, and not superb quality, but you get what you pay for. Fit as expected. I wear a L-XL and the XL is perfect."
3.0,I like the way it stops the sun glare when driving but it won’t stay in the up position
3.0,Not even sure I'll wear this one.
3.0,"Great design got it really fast but would love if it wasn't so narrow, was expecting a more chucky or thicker ring."
3.0,It s still nice get 1 Suze smaller
3.0,The shirt said L-13 and I ordered a 4T it’s kind of big for my child should of got a 3T.
3.0,Leaves marks on cheeks.
3.0,"Bought this for my wife, and she likes it. She has not had any allergic reaction to it, nor has it turned her toe green, so it seems to be made of pure Sterling silver. There​ was not, in fact, a cubic zirconia in the middle, as other reviewers have stated."
3.0,"Looks almost like the picture although the band is brighter than I expected. Keeps time but the setting button gets caught periodically and causes the watch to stop until I realize what has happened. Still, it is cute and the price is good."
3.0,"This fit way too small, and kind of looked like a mini dress on me.  I had to return it because I was looking for something that goes to knee length for work."
3.0,I would give this 5 stars if the rhinestone not start fell off the first time I wore it and the back of the brooch come off too. So disappointed.
3.0,"Great style & fit, but the black will scratch off real quick. They're cheap so buy them to have fun & wear once or twice!"
3.0,"I bought this tote to roll from car to office and back. It billed itself as large enough to carry a 15-inch laptop, which it does, but it's a chore to wedge the computer into the case. It's not an easy fit. Ideally this tote should be two inches wider and two or three inches deeper to hold all my office stuff. I can place my laptop, tablet and lunch bag in, but the tote is a little small to contain those items plus anything else (such as a notebook or small purse) and I sometimes have to leave it unzipped at the top and still carry something from my shoulder. The handle feels flimsy and the tote isn't bottom-heavy enough to handle fast turns well, but so far it's holding up. I didn't want to buy one of the giant rolling office totes, but the next best size, which is this tote, is a little small. And it's way too small to use as an overnight bag. It's more or less meeting my needs, but I'm still looking for a bag designed for car-to-office that isn't so big it makes me look like a traveling salesman with a sample case."
3.0,"I'm sorry to say this, but as a plus-sized woman, just pass on this one.<br /><br />It is reasonably close to size. The only nice thing I can say is that it has pockets in the top, super nice to tuck in a tissue.<br /><br />The basic design is nice, but because of the fabric used, it just clings in a VERY uncomplimentary way. Every bump, lump and roll is highlighted, and the top pulls over it. It is just ugly.<br /><br />So, still on the hunt for a top that won't highlight chubby parts and is still comfortable to wear."
3.0,"Product itself was fine, sizing is WAY off. Ordered an XL, fit more like a Med."
3.0,Not compression at all
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but size up . It didn't go with the colors of my new daughter in law's wedding, great if you are shaped like barbie. I usually wear a size 10 and even 14 was too small in the waist."
3.0,Good back pack but the anti theft ting makes it a real hastle whenever you need to get something out and put it away. If you are worried about theft it’s great.
3.0,"It is very small and the stones are not bright like the picture. Also, the clasp changed colors."
3.0,slightly uncomfortable to wear due to the points.
3.0,I have small legs (probably my best feature) and they just came very small. Probably more for a child if you want the full effect
3.0,"Fits well and the material is very soft. It is a tad bit longer than I expected though. Also, the black one is a bit see through and when I got it, there were a bunch of small pieces of thread all over it. I bought it in two colors (black and mauve) because I really liked the style and the reviews were good. I guess for the price I haven't lost much money on these"
3.0,Its too large for my face
3.0,The diamonds fell off with minimal movement.
3.0,Rings are very nice design. They are small did not fit all my finger sizes.
3.0,"They are beautiful, but for my ears, they are a bit heavy;  after I wear them for a while the weight makes my ear lubes hurt."
3.0,Watch the size chart size up .
3.0,Was cheap but you get what you pay for .
3.0,"I wanted to love these, and could forgive them for any one flaw - but it’s death by a thousand cuts on these.<br /><br />Good:<br />Warm hat!<br />Bluetooth hat!<br />Mostly work!<br /><br />Not-so-good:<br />“Please charging” all the time. Battery life plummeted after a few uses. It says “please charging” ina friendly voice a few times and then does.<br />Buttons impossible to use<br />Have to disassemble and remove everything to clean it ( can’t machine wash )<br />Hard to position speakers evenly, or comfortably<br />Have to turn to 11 to hear, then everyone can hear your music/book.<br />Can be a pain in the rear to pair<br /><br />That said, for a Bluetooth hat to wear around the house, it’s not *uncomfortable* and can beat wearing over-the-ears/earbuds, but not for long - pretty weak battery life is the biggest let down."
3.0,"Nice dress, but the size was too big. Had to return."
3.0,"My daughter is a true 2T and this won't fit her for much longer. It is good quality though - nice, thick material and the front is lined."
3.0,Cute but the color seems very yellow almost orange gold.
3.0,El buzo es muy grande y fea la tela
3.0,It was so cute in the picture but when it arrived the waffle type material was too much for me. I ordered the baby blue color. Might be nice in a darker color where the pattern does not stand out.
3.0,"This dress is way under sized !! Loved the dress good material , made well ,so disappointed it didn't fit"
3.0,"Very pretty, but very delicate! The bend  just putting the backs on."
3.0,The top part was good but the bottom was too big
3.0,I like the bracelet however the tag (the MOST IMPORTANT part) has become very scratched and probably soon be unreadable. I should have known to just stick with my tried and true regular vendor.
3.0,I ordered three of these pants in different colors/designs as I really liked the first ones (brown pinstriped). These fit smaller than the other two and are a bit shiny for me as opposed to the pinstriped counterparts.
3.0,Pro:<br />- Good looking<br />- Comfortable<br />- Touchscreen works<br />Con:<br />- Not warm enough for below 20F; my hands were freezing around 10-15F<br />- Strong leather smell
3.0,Love the meaning behind it. I find the piece is very thin wished it was a little thicker. Seems like it would bend easily.
3.0,Well for me is very small
3.0,"I mean these robs are yes soft and has the unicorn style pretty pink, but they do not soak the water after bath. I notice my girls are kind of feeling cold. I usually need to dry them with a better towel to really dry them."
3.0,"I bought this since it was better rated on Amazon than the equivalent Kiwi product, which I have used before.  I applied it to a pair of light tan deerskin slippers, and, as expected, it made the slippers several shades darker when applied.  However, unlike the Kiwi product, the color did not return to normal after the product dried.  So now I have a pair of slippers several shades darker than they were originally.  That's not a major problem for me, but others might not like the result."
3.0,The fabric is really soft; not necessarily ideal for working out but possibly yoga or just hanging around the house.
3.0,I bought this boot on sale for $39 and it is worth that price.  They are warm and lightweight but after only a few weeks of wear they are starting the lose their warmth in the toes and sole is already breaking down.  Final verdict is but if under $50 but pass if you expect them to hold up for a full season
3.0,I love the pendant but chain is not good at all
3.0,"very much liked , but two out of the five did not work."
3.0,It is so pretty. A little see through and I wish it was wider and not as long . I think clothing manufacturers think all women are 7 feet tall and skinny
3.0,Not at all soft and has a feeling of plastic. But fits comfortably
3.0,The face of the watch is very attractive but the band looks cheap and was more thin than expected.
3.0,Not thick or great quality but good enough to get the job done once.
3.0,they are low rise boxer/briefs. they ride up on me and i don't use them. : /
3.0,"When brand new these don't look cheap or fake like a lot of other sunglasses do, but they wear out fast... very fast. The lenses get worn out after two or three weeks and they look 'foggy' when you look through them as they get covered from thousands of little micro scratches. Eventually I left them out in my car during a hot summer day and the colored plastic film on the frame bubbled up essentially rendering them useless.<br /><br />These sunglasses would be perfect for a costume or as a trial to see if it is the right style for you, but don't expect them to out perform $5 worth of expectations."
3.0,"these earrings are very cute but when my daughter ( or any little girl) will play with them , they fall out and get lost."
3.0,"These gloves seemed like the perfect addition to my son's growing Spiderman collection.  Although my son is 5 the gloves are a bit too small for him and way too long.  Perhaps this product is better suited for a taller thinner child.  They would be a lot more fun if they fit.  Don't discount them on my word.  I would not purchase them again, however, it is a great addition to a child's Spiderman collection as long as they fit comfortably."
3.0,"Good value for the money, but it needed a lot of fiddling to fit it to a Casio MDV106-1A, I broke two springbars in the process. Both items are relatively inexpensive, so they complement each other well and you get a fairly good looking tool watch that can take a real beating"
3.0,Lights up well. But one of the 3 clips broke the first time I put it on.
3.0,"The shirt looks awesome, so I ordered a large, since that was what my Bronco's shirt I was wearing at the time was. This Large one is a tad too small, and way too tight around the neck. (Even the XL I ordered is tight around the neck)<br /><br />I glanced at the NFL shop return policy and saw 100% satisfaction guarenteed, and ""pre-paid return shipping"", so I figured I would lose the frt I paid to get it but would not have to pay frt to return. So I ordered an XL to see how it fit, and submitted a return auth for the LG, only to find out I have to pay frt afterall to return one. So now, it looks like I'm stuck paying 3 freight charges for just one shirt that fits! That equals almost the entire price a the shirt!"
3.0,Too heavy at 1 lb real plated gold chains are very light weight also the color is of the chain doesn't look gold but silver gold.
3.0,The dress is really cute  and the size seems to be right. The dress' straps are connected to the back with 2 very flimsy thin tiny plastic rings that already broke  upon arrival. I have to replace them with some metal rings I have. I would have given it 2 stars if it's not cute. The price is right. You get a cheap dress so can't complain.
3.0,I dislike the fact that the product ripped the second time I put it on. It was not durable to last at all. I bought it to hide away my stomach.
3.0,I love it. I got a bigger size thinking it will shrink but it didn't so it's a little big on me. But I love them.
3.0,The straight pants fitted fine & looked good. Thanks
3.0,Large is more like Medium.
3.0,and was a pain to fix.
3.0,"Item was too small for my project,  So I returned this item...r"
3.0,"Much thinner than I expected... like about as wide as a single strand of hair. I don't see this lasting long. Also, I ordered a 24&#34; but the one they sent measure closer to 22&#34;."
3.0,After a few washes they do not maintain their shape. A bit disappointed. My daughter likes the designs on them.
3.0,"When the weather is 31 and feels like 25, you feel the cold between the fingers."
3.0,"I have had these packing cubes for about three years now, and they’ve stood up okay. The seams on three of the bags have ripped out which makes them a bit harder to use. And the zipper on one bag ripped the third use. Definitely be careful and handle with care, you’re definitely getting what you pay for!"
3.0,"Thin and cheap material, but a cute play outfit for the price"
3.0,"Wonderful, but one of the beads came off when I put it around my neck."
3.0,"THE SKIRT WAS BEAUTIFUL, IT DID STATED THAT TO ORDER A SIZE UP FROM YOUR NORMAL SIZE, DUE TO RUNNING A BIT SMALL, I KEPT IT BECAUSE IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THE COLOR IS  AWESOME. I ORDERED THE X-LARGE, IT WAS A BIT SNUG BUT I WAS STILL ABLE TO BREATHE AND SIT. I WORE IT ALL THAT DAY AND HAD PLENTY OF COMPLIMENTS. JUST WACTCH YOUR SIZING, (THE SNUG FIT WAS ONLY IN THE WAIST BAND AREA). IT FLOWED BEAUTIFULLY WITH 5&#34; HEELS. THE WAIST BAND IS NOTHING A SEAMTRESS CAN NOT FIX, I LOVE THE SKIRT AND OREDING ANOTHER COLOR IN IT. I HAVE COUPLE FRIENDS THAT HAVE ORDERED THIS SKIRT AND HAD ORDERED THE OTHER COLORS ALSO."
3.0,Dress is just ok
3.0,"A lot smaller than expected. I wear a medium, ordered a large, but should have gotten an xl"
3.0,These earrings are huge but nice
3.0,"Fits well, but very thin material!"
3.0,The description is a men’s vest yet the zipper talon is typical of a woman’s zipper. The pockets are made of nylon that Tears easily.
3.0,Suspicious it's a knock off. Side pocket zipper is sticky. Hardware flimsy. Use everyday so we'll see how long it lasts.<br />Update. Returned
3.0,"I bought this for casual wear with flat sandals. I ended up ordering two. The first was heavier material and fit snugger. The second was less cottony, looser and not sewn as well. The seams pucker in spots---hoping they'll straighten out. Shouldn't have pushed my luck!"
3.0,Looks good. Keeps time well. But dial is NOT luminous as advertized.
3.0,"I was hoping for a higher quality and better fitting shirt to honor my mother by.  The shirt material is thin, a bit “boxy” and the ribbon is a bit off. I won’t be wearing it as I had hoped."
3.0,"Overall the dress and fabric is nice for a costume. The skirt is lined and the belt is adjustable. I ordered a Medium based on the size chart and the bust/waist fit is accurate compared to what's listed on the chart. But the skirt length and sleeves are short in an odd way. I'm only 5 ft 4 in tall and this was too short for me to wear, even with flats. If you had a black petticoat or something to wear underneath it might hide the weird length. But I'm returning this."
3.0,"It should be NO SHOW, but when I wear Toms shoes, top of the socks is showing a bit."
3.0,Same as the the other reviews with these socks maybe I got the wrong size just wasn't long enough
3.0,"Fits fine, but the underwires are flimsy and easily shift out of place"
3.0,"Viene muy reducido, tuve que ordenarlo dos veces y ni asi le quedo a mi niña. Es talla 5-6 y ordene 7-8 y esta demasiado pequeño. La calidad esta buena."
3.0,"Based on the reviews I read before I purchased the robe, it's what I expected. Not the quality of the Victoria's Secret robe I just retired that lasted 15 years, but it's becoming more difficult to find a quality cotton terry bathrobe. The texture is a little rough but it's obsorbant and that's what I was looking for. The sleeves are long enough for me, which is hard to find."
3.0,"Love the hat, just didn’t care for how it looked when it got dropped off. It was in a bag and completely smashed flat and had creases in it. I had to steam it to get them to come out."
3.0,Way smaller in person
3.0,This is cute but super heavy.
3.0,"It's nice, soft. Color is pretty."
3.0,It’s nice beanie just wish it fit my head
3.0,So-So
3.0,"The earrings are very beautiful, BUT they are VERY small. I read 20 mm (total size) and did not realize that the hooks are actually bigger than the moon symbol with the stone. Just the right size for a little girl."
3.0,Liner is no longer removable. Debris sticks to the liner and is all but impossible to remove. With my old Crocs I could remove and wash the liner. Great shoe intol they decided to glue in the sticky material liner.
3.0,"I use this model while training with the Olympic team back in the early 90s. Very easy to use as I recall and wanted one for jogging and hiking now. Only thing it will not even come close to fitting on my wrist. I'd say that if you are 5'11 or taller don't bother with this. Great watch, but tiny watch band."
3.0,"Its beautiful, but I have very small hands so I'm going to use it for a gift"
3.0,"the style is good and as described. However, I did not like the material of the shirt."
3.0,A little to small for my taste
3.0,"Ordered up a size, it barely fit. Order at least 2 sizes bigger."
3.0,Purchased for my son and he loved it.
3.0,These aren’t necessarily “compression” shirts. I’d recommend getting a larger size b/c the shirts ride up your waist when working out. They are nice & comfortable.
3.0,Definitely size down. I am 5’9” and usually wear a size 12 and could have easily gotten away with a medium.
3.0,I wanted to love this but it's just a little to short on the torso. I am 5'3 size 16-18  so I ordered a xxl. It fit everywhere else fine not tight on the legs or waist. It needs to be longer on the torso though. I could stretch it up & tie it but my breast are higher them where it is sewn for it to be.  I dont have a long torso I am mostly legs so....<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest review.
3.0,I order blue not turquoise
3.0,Should be more of real flesh color.
3.0,"I needed something to hang the fabric of my dress through and it looked cute for a short amount of time, but it would not have lasted all day. It arrived and the chain was already disconnected, but it was an easy fix. I wish the chain a a little stronger so I could wear it all day and know that I wouldn't be flashing the Comic con at some point in the day."
3.0,The design is good although strangely the skirt part is narrower than other M sized pencil skirts made by Miusol.
3.0,material on the thin side.
3.0,Can't put your cellphone in the purse with a case it has to be without one to fit. Not a fan
3.0,"So the pockets are completely inaccessable because of how the shorts were stitched on the skirt! Just wanted to say that. Ill still wear it because its incredibly comfortable, and i didn't buy it for the pockets themselves."
3.0,"pretty large shirt, bought for my 13 year old niece, but it's way too big....took a long long time to be shipped, but it looks awesome"
3.0,doesn't stay on the ears very well
3.0,It is long enough for my daughter but it is very tight.
3.0,Bought them for my kids for school and they do not like them and they are not comfortable to them.
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE the print of this band, the price is BEYOND great, and I usually don't have an issue with this type of band and have several in seemingly the same material, but man this one is really irritating to my wrist! I do have more sensitive skin than some people, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it, either way it is just not the most comfortable band for me! I love it so much though that I will still wear it on special occasions where I don't plan to wear my watch for more than a few hours, but definitely not an all day or overnight (for sleep tracking) band!"
3.0,This is a one size fits all as long as you wear size 9 or smaller.
3.0,The earrings hurt a little when u're wearing them. I think they are just super super thin. I'm ok with them.
3.0,I have this exact hoodie in black but the navy one doesn’t have the same stretch. Fits smaller than the black
3.0,"I loved the look, but the chain broke a week after receiving it."
3.0,"Price was great and it was sent quickly. The printing is much more fuzzy than I had expected (words can’t be read), but for a wall decor it’s lovely and easy!"
3.0,"Good cheap studs but tarnished quickly to a brassy color. Still looks okay but not gold. I just wanted something stylish for work that I didn't mind losing, very trendy and easy to keep spare pairs around to polish my look on the go."
3.0,"I love it, it's beautiful! BUT I ordered 2 sizes larger than I usually order and it was STILL too small. I re-ordered it in 3 sizes larger than I normally wear and I'm returning this one. I'm so grateful for free returns :)"
3.0,"I was okay, but it fit funny.  Like too loose in some spots and too tight in others.  I returned it."
3.0,"I loved the cuffs, they were just a little too thight on the wrist."
3.0,"Runs small, definitely order several sizes up. Very cute shirt, will work great with maxi skirts in summer."
3.0,"I love everything about this dress, except that the armbands are way too tight!😔"
3.0,"Loved the shirt, but fits small compared to their sweaters - which I LOVE!!"
3.0,"Very soft material. However sizing is off, the small is only about 23 inches long, much shorter than stated. The bust is 35 inches."
3.0,"The band is really great! Super cute and very comfortable. I can take it on and off with 1 hand. Exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />However, the frame is loose.<br />My blaze is does not snap in securely. It rattles around and comes out easily. Plus, the buttons don't work. It's also matte while the clips on the band are shiny. I have noticed this problem a lot with Blaze frames on Amazon.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars for the band but only 1 star for the frame. If you already have a good frame, it could be worth picking this up just for the band. But you'll need to buy the frame separately."
3.0,It was just to small around but everything else I loved.
3.0,It is a very pretty mask<br />I like that it has the adjustment ear pieces but it’s super fitting to your face. And not as easy to breath through then I imaged.
3.0,The fabric was nice and soft.  Unfortunately it was entirely too big.  The sleeves were also a little more poofy than I would have liked.
3.0,See more pictures on Instagram @Santrean.reviews<br /><br />Very beautiful rose gold dress! It was however extremely short I had to keep pulling it down because it rises bad. The fit was perfect.<br /><br />See more pictures on Instagram @Santrean.reviews
3.0,I bought these mask because they can hang around your neck. The problem with these mask is the design around the ears. After wear the mask for an hour my ear become sore because there is much material on the straps around ears. Fix this and you have a great product..
3.0,"Runs very small...I ordered an XL and it would fit maybe a 10.  Very nicely made.  However it is not like the picture which is also frustrating.  The whole front is the design, not both black and design.  Straps are very short."
3.0,The ridges in the shoe make it not comfortable
3.0,"This dress is absolutely adorable! I am so sad, though because it runs wayyyy small. My little sister typically wears mediums in clothing and we bought this dress in XL and it fits her perfectly."
3.0,Product did not stay on shoe after walking around in the grass.
3.0,"My shirt came with a bunch of loose threads all over it. The material feels okay, but I'm thinking it will likely unravel if I wash it too often."
3.0,Only complaint is the light sucks...
3.0,I got a big dome but kinda small
3.0,"Very Pretty but smaller than I expected and not rayon like I envision rayon to be.  It is more like spandex.  I would have been disappointed were it for myself however, this was a gift for my daughter and she is happy with it."
3.0,Hard to get on. But once on looks good
3.0,"I wanted these to be a replacement for gymshark and they just are not. They are not squat proof and they run small. If you have hips or a butt order a size up and if you're working out in them, just order gymshark."
3.0,Wrong color the black is a white pair but still cute
3.0,"The suit looks nice, but it stretches in water so it became too loose."
3.0,I’m normally a 2x so we did the 3x just to have extra room and it was way to small still but the fabric and description are spot on just order a few sizes up
3.0,"cheap material, too small on the waist, returned"
3.0,"Arrived in 4x6 nylon bag. Good for small packing spaces/camping. Thin material, but will suffice for gulf coast winter weather. Over priced for quality."
3.0,"This bag is super cute and very spacious. I love all the different compartments to sort my toiletry products. The fabric is robust, but I have had some issues with the zipper catching. It's a minor issue - the zipper still works - but I would hope that future manufactured bags would have a higher quality zipper that doesn't catch as users zip around the bottom curves of the bag."
3.0,One ring was fine the other had bubbling of the inner finish. Poor quality. I expected more of a licensed BBC product
3.0,"These pants aren't the best material, I wore them for about 2 hrs and already had little balls all over the sides. Not very happy with this purchase."
3.0,A lot smaller than expected. I normally wear a large but ordered XL it was still way small! I should have ordered either XXL or not at all. It can never be dried in a dryer.
3.0,"It was wider than my hat ban, but I was using it on a lady hat, which may have been the reason it was too wide."
3.0,"First of all, it holds everything in very nicely and it’s adorable. HOWEVER. The placement of the straps is just awful. I’m a runner and weight lifter, and I’m bugged nonstop by where the straps fall on my shoulder blades. It also runs a little small. But if you care more about being held in than strap comfort, this is a good-quality item."
3.0,Too small! Thought It would be bigger. Can’t really fit much in it. However great material and style
3.0,This is a nice necklace but there are fewer strands than depicted in the photo.
3.0,Perfect fit. Super cute. Only downfall is that when my son walks around the light will change or turn on.
3.0,Super cute but they broke :(
3.0,Not fit to size! Go up 1 to 2 sizes if ordering
3.0,"Very comfortable but not exactly what I imagined...hoped for a slight tapering into the knee are as pictured - for a more classic, sophisticated look. These are not tapered at all and seem a bit boxy as a result. These seem more matronly."
3.0,Stitching is coming apart. Cute but likely only get a few uses out of it.
3.0,"This is extremely thin and flimsy, as expected, it runs small, it shows every stomach roll and crevice Lol. The main problem why I hated it is because the overskirt is nothing like shown in the photo. It’s not a sheer flowy material, it’s a shiny, stiff, “Halloween” type taffeta material. Cheap looking, the quality isn’t there, and it just isn’t flattering for me unfortunately."
3.0,"Though the description doesn't include the ""feature"" of the American Dental Association logo on the back, it's added in as a freebie :)<br />The logo's in the pictures, but it wasn't labeled as the back of the grid-it so I didn't realize it was included. Still works fine, just kind of lame."
3.0,"Thin material, looks very appealing. Sleeves were a little shorter than expected."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5ee7f1c7fdd4a7cb5f94a6493d981296]] Love the pattern and dress.  I bought two of these dresses, different colors, and same size.  However, one fit like xl and one for like a medium."
3.0,"This is a smaller cropped top jacket then I thought it would be. Looks like it would sit right at the top of Jean's but it does not, it covers the boob area and that is about it. I was also hoping for more of a sweat shirt material, it's actually 100% polyester.  I normally wear a size small but ordered a medium and it looked like I was wearing a 5 year olds jacket. Expected one thing and got another, bummed about it...."
3.0,The top straps were a little loose but can't beat the price
3.0,didnt fit past my knees
3.0,"this product while it felt durable, and it did lift a ton, the cup sizes were unfortunately way too small.so maybe order a size or 2 up. i got a c cup and it looked and felt like it was meant for a smaller b cup. i needed this strapless bra for a wedding, and unfortunately did not have time to return it. this item comes with many different types a straps which is nice if it fit."
3.0,Cute socks but they do tend to slip off :(
3.0,"Keep in mind that these are basically long-underwear.  I bought these expecting them to be a heavier material to wear as outer cover during dove season when it's warm... I just miss-read, but just want to make sure other people don't make the same mistake :D."
3.0,"Arrived as seen, but the pin part broke off."
3.0,The item looked as described however it fell apart before I received it and still had hot glue on it
3.0,Quality of the material isn’t good. Size are extra small.
3.0,"It's definitely not a crazy high quality watch band. The clips that slide into the watch body come out of place a bit but the watch has never fallen off my arm or anything. Also the band is a little rugged around the hole I usually put the bar through but not more than any other leather watch I've ever owned. If you're looking for a cheap, nice-looking watch band, this is as good as you can get."
3.0,These were just okay for me. They were a little large for me but didn't look great on my husband either. They do the trick and are effective but they aren't my first choice pair of sunglasses.  I like the general style if they had a better fit for me. I like the lenses and coloration.
3.0,"I'm a 38C and ordered a large. Sadly, it was way too tight in the chest area; it technically fit but just barely and let's just say it wasn't as family-friendly as I'd hoped. The rest of the dress fit great though! Very flattering style and the material is very comfortable and light. A great dress for summer and I wish I could have kept it. I'd definitely recommend it if your chest is smaller."
3.0,"Fits great, stretchy neckline works for adjusting to what you’re wearing it with. Light breathable material. Held up well when washed/dried."
3.0,they're okay... get what you pay for with cheap eyewear - they are quite a bit larger than they look from the photos.
3.0,"200.00 wow, they had the same bracelet a day a go for 1415.00 like in the stores and now it says its no longer available and then the have the same for 200 more."
3.0,"Rather cheaply made, but I wasn't looking for 'fine' jewelry for my ankle summer wear, so this is awesome."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:2a0964259ded13487a0bdf89dce88882]] The stiching could use some improvement.
3.0,The neck was very tight and other area to loose.
3.0,The cups in the swimsuit are funky... every time I put on the swimsuit the cups fold. I then spend 10 minutes trying to fix them. The cups are then creased and it looks funky. If you just want a work out swimsuit it will do but defnetly is not cute to wear out
3.0,"The heart shape is really pretty, however you get what you pay for. Dont expect this to last a long time and dont wear it near water."
3.0,"This dress looks much more casual in person. Was looking for something more formal for a winter wedding, therefore I returned this. For was as described, just more like a cotton summer dress."
3.0,So tiny  My nose  piercing it  too far up to wear  these.  Not  sure if others will fit better.  Or  maybe I got the wrong  size.  they are  pretty  and  seem well made.  Good  price for getting 4 rings.  I have  to  figure out the  sizes  better when ordering on line.  I have tried one in  my cartledge  piercing  and it looks  good.  but  afraid I will loose it.<br />I did recieve these at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  These are nice  little rings.  I just  ordered the wrong size.
3.0,My daughter is a normal sized 9 year old and this was very tight on her. It's also very thin material compared to other gaiters I have seen. The print is very cute though.
3.0,"Do not wash this because it shrinks.  Otherwise, the garment is soft."
3.0,"It is a decent belt, kinda stylish."
3.0,"I really really wanted to like this and it is so close for me, I was about to keep it. But I don’t like the material and around the belly and pocket area it is very saggy."
3.0,I followed the fit guidelines for my hips and couldn't get them over my hips.  I need to reorder 2 sizes up..
3.0,A little stiff and a little tight in the bodice but looks pretty!
3.0,"I often wear polo shirts for casual wear, this one caught my eye because of the bright color and it is also priced for value. Usually these polyester shirts are comfortable and have good moisture wicking properties, this one falls a little short. It is 65% polyester, 35% rayon, thick material, not as comfortable as most other polo shirts I’ve tried, doesn’t wick moisture as well so feels a little stuffy on humid days. It fits well though, no loose threads, sewing is tight. No logo or branding on the left upper chest panel."
3.0,"I'm so disappointed. The shirt is very pretty and comfortable, and was a nice length. I washed it in cold water and partially dried it, and the length shrunk. It's wearable, but the way it puckered all over doesn't look like a nice shirt anymore. :-("
3.0,"Beautiful ring but very dull, I was expecting shiny silver."
3.0,It's not a bad band just not made for an active 7 year old. Had it a few months before the loop the band goes through broke.
3.0,The fabric of this night gown is very thin and light. The cup size runs very very very small making it an awkward fit for a person with larger breasts.
3.0,"gave it to my daughter , it is very very small"
3.0,The clasp broke the first time putting this on. It's very cute but poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Shoe is a good one but the light up part is very sporadic and child has to stomp hard to get them to come on.
3.0,They are so small that they get lost on your key chain.
3.0,Good fit. Nice quality. True to size.
3.0,"I did not love the material, it was a little bit shiny and I prefer a matte color. Other than that it was fine. I returned it."
3.0,"Looks nice so far. It’s kind of weird that the place where you “buckle” is off center. I guess it depends on your wrist size, but I’d say mine is average. However, my old one, had the “loop” attached to the face, so it is still weird nonetheless. Also, I hate how some of my shirts get snagged on the band."
3.0,White seemed dingy to me.
3.0,"Didn't really look great, returned"
3.0,"I ordered according to the measurements provided, and it fit true to size and was very comfortable.  The only issue is the color.  In the picture it appears as if the lace is the same color as the bottom skirt,  but its lighter.  There isnt as much rouching in the skirt as depicted in the picture either.  Because of the price and fit,  I may just keep it."
3.0,Cute but not long enough..not as soft as I like but perhaps with washing if t bff ey don't shrink.
3.0,"This bag is very sturdy. The colors are vibrant and look really nice. My only problem with this was how the zipper is very inset. The image with the dimensions would have you believe you can fit something that is just under 29cm tall in it. Unfortunately, the zipper is set in about 2 inches which cuts off the height. I purchased this because I thought it was going to fit my laptop after reading the dimensions but it didn't fit. Disappointing. I hope they update the image for the dimensions to accurately show the size of the interior of the bag. Other than that, it would be a great bag."
3.0,Not the exact color in the photo
3.0,The quality of these are nice.  But I wouldn't call them childrens sunglasses.  They fit me.  So I am saving them until the kids are older.
3.0,It's too large than I expected. Otherwise I like the quality and model
3.0,My sleeves won’t stay rolled and I’m not crazy about the color but it’s good for pairing with leggings or jeans for running around town.
3.0,"It’s not the warmest, but it will do for a cute look for fall"
3.0,"I like them but the balls are pretty big, bigger than I expected."
3.0,"It's cute, but it's super pink. Not purple like the picture."
3.0,Looks just like photo but cheap materials so you get what you pay for!
3.0,If you normally wear a large order a medium. It was way to big.
3.0,"Cloth is very thin. Then again, i guess it makes it less hot. It does not feel like it is going to fall apart, and you can't see your head through it when you wear it, but you sure can see light through it.<br /><br />The colors are cool and they don't look bad. And of course they are not at all expensive.<br /><br />I'm using them."
3.0,"MUCH larger than expected.  Cute enough but not sure it's worth the price, even the discounted price. It reminds me of a small sparkly tire when it's not on my arm, I'd keep shopping."
3.0,"These do the job, but lost their bright color pretty quickly."
3.0,This is the perfect size for me but I didn't realize it was vinyl so the sum comes through a little.  In the long run it will probably be easier to maintain than a cloth one.  I suggest you get one of the cast iron bases if you don't have a table.
3.0,"Ordered extra large, shirt looks like it is supposed to have flowing look, but fits almost like a fitted shirt, no flow. Material wrinkles easily, not what I was looking for. Not for curvy girls, super tight on my chest. Material was see through as well. It is a nice shirt though, skinny friend liked it when I regifted it to her."
3.0,"Very pretty,  but too big"
3.0,Got a medium and the bottoms were right while the top is small. I do have a bigger butt so it's generally harder for me to find bikinis but this one is essentially a thong bikini so it should be so tight if it's already up my butt
3.0,Perfect size but poor quality
3.0,"Realmente depende para cada persona, pero en lo personal, está muy estrecho para poder meterlo en la cabeza no estira lo suficiente y aprieta la parte donde está la bocina"
3.0,"The scarf looks like a lighter green in person.  Very thin, and not as long as I excepted, but will look good with a white tee or a jacket.  I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest review."
3.0,For the most part I  like them but the insoles are terrible i had to buy a second pair of insoles
3.0,"Its a cute bag and the size was perfect for taking on a flight. I had bought it specifically for a trip. Unfortunately, one of the zippers broke after using it maybe 3 times on my trip. It did make me regret going for a less expensive alternative of a mini backpack, I would not recommend the product."
3.0,"The fabric is spandex, get your exact size dont get a size up. Also the seams are stitched interesting you can see it. And it’s a bit see through so make sure to wear white underneath. And when it first arrives it had some white breast things like they have in a sports bra but these were the size of melons they were huge so we had to cut the dress to get them out."
3.0,I look for clothes that are mostly cotton. Amazon advertises this as 95%cotton and 5%polyester. Dress label says it is actually 100% POLYESTER. So dishonest. Some of us sweat and are extremely uncomfortable in clothes without cotton. So please don't advertise these as such.
3.0,"These over knee socks are a thick material that is very soft, which I love. However, I have muscular legs, so they fit pretty tight at the top of my leg. Would be perfect for thinner legged girls. The pink is much brighter than I had thought, but I like it."
3.0,"I like wood tees and I thought Bamboo would be cool. Unfortunately, since the wood is soft and the shaft of the tee is too long, if it goes completely to the stop into hard turf it will break on every shot. The solution for the manufacturer, if they are listening, is the keep the same point but shorten the shaft 1/2"" so the total length is 1"" not 1 1/2"". This will keep the tee from breaking. It should flip out of the ground on each shot not break off!"
3.0,"The picture makes it look like there are actual metal pieces inside, but it is actually a print on paper. It still looks alright, and my husband will still wear them, but it's a bit disappointing."
3.0,"very flattering I used it several times, got complements as well"
3.0,It's not thick enough. You can see right through it.
3.0,"This is beautiful!  Nice big keychain, just what I wanted and it is so pretty....BUT it fell off my key after a week and half of having it.  So whatever the little connection is to the keychain it comes on was not sturdy.  The little links it was attached to were still hanging there but the actual piece itself is gone forever...I have no clue where or when it fell off, so that's sad but I won't order another one, even though I love the look, it's just not worth buying if it's not going to last a while, let alone a week and a half. ☹"
3.0,"Love the color, however both end of the are same size with no spot to tuck the back portion in place. Must have a tie pin or tie clip to wear it"
3.0,"Soft material. Good fit. Good shirt and sleeve length. Neck is too high though, I felt like I was choking. I cut the neck out a little but and stretched it to make the material roll for an instant hem."
3.0,Bend easily. Wore them laying on couch watching a movie and the one I was laying on bent and came undone. So I would say they are kind of flimsy. I'm keeping them cause they are pretty but be careful with them.
3.0,"So, at first glance these are very pretty. Not a high quality item, but they can pass well enough. But the are SO HEAVY. I'm bummed. I can't stand feeling my earlobes being dragged down and I'm not sure I'll be able to wear them. I do really like the shape, and they arrived quickly. They look fantastic with my ivory and gold dress, but feel like fishing weights...at least to me."
3.0,Love this wallet but only had it for 17 days and the clip that holds the wrist band just broke in half. SO disappointed!
3.0,"Misleading description of ""leather"" wallet. Made of synthetic material. Does not feel like leather unlike better PU leathers.  It is compact. Does have a small pocket for some change."
3.0,"I received the one only same color, no brand name, different type"
3.0,"The tunnel could have a bigger opening. I'm only a two gauge, but the hole is terribly small. Plus they look better in the picture.<br />More than likely I'll return these."
3.0,"Very cute, but a little lacking in quality.  I just got these a couple weeks ago and one already has a small hole.  However, for the price, I'll order more!"
3.0,"Had to buy a second pair. First broke after just a few weeks. The hinges don't have any outward flex. I was surprised by this, since all other glasses and sunglasses that I have ever bought have hinges (I think with springs?) that enable the arms to bend outward past perpendicular to the frame. This is important for taking them off and putting them on. You have to precisely put them on and take them off from dead-center on your face, so as not to force the arms into an obtuse angle, as they'll snap right off. This is the only weak point in the construction, but the product would be much better if the hinges were improved"
3.0,The waist gets stretched out and I had to keep pulling them up not very good. And the fabric is very thin. Ok
3.0,"a link was missing in the front, making it hang lop sided. had to fix it myself, no reply from seller"
3.0,Bag is smaller than I expected. I like a big bag. Because color and style of bag are nice I will be keeping it to give as gift to a friend.
3.0,"I can see how these would be comfortable.  I went by the sizing chart, and the size I normally wear, but when I recieved these, they are huge!  I dont reccomend buying these online. Find a store so you can try them on."
3.0,The ears aren't quite as prominent as I would have hoped and the white belly is a weird kind of fuzzy softish fabric that I'm not particularly fond of. But it's cute..
3.0,It was good while it lasted. It broke easily and I was sad because I really liked it
3.0,"Not as comfortable, size isn’t accurate. It really doesn’t help you sweat as you wanted."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:da6ce57b03f79295ac62bdde6dc2d9f5]] Broke easily
3.0,"Ordered in blue for my grandson and he loved it but after wearing for only 4-5 days, while out playing he lost the lava rock"
3.0,"Only worked on an IPAD not upgraded, after 3 different devices fails, IOS and Android."
3.0,"All the cotton pj's sold on Amazon shrink quite a bit. I have learned the hard way to buy one size larger in order to get to my size after the first wash. Some brands (Del Rosa for one), continue to shrink until you can no longer wear them. At least this brand, once shrunk, will stay at that size and no further shrinkage will occur. I gave this brand (I have bought all the cotton flannel PJ styles) 3 stars due to this. Otherwise, I am happy with the pj's."
3.0,No worries
3.0,"This dress has no closure -- no hooks, no snaps, no buttons!  Simply wrapping the bodice does NOT keep this dress closed."
3.0,"I dont ever write reviews but thought I would on this one. This sweater is really cute, the color is good and is the same product as shown in the pictures but the size runs really really small. I bought a 3X and its probably 2 sizes too small. I'm really bummed it doesn't fit :("
3.0,"This is a very nice quality dress, and well made.  I had to return it because the waist is about three inches above where the waist should be.  It makes it look odd and would be better suited for someone petite."
3.0,"Thin. Material is printed on one side, inside is white. It’s cute. Slick material. Will use as a robe more than likely."
3.0,Made cheap but cute idea.
3.0,"I would say if you're larger than a B cup, you will have side boob visibility…at least I did! BUT, I will wear on vacation, like at the beach or a beach party…definitely not in the general public."
3.0,This runs a bit loose and the front is crazy short! I loved the material and that it was very light.  The color was very nice as well.  The fit was horrible though.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
3.0,Cute but because it wraps the wrap doesnt go around enough to cover your crotch area.  Disappointed
3.0,Looked nice but way too small
3.0,Too small ....
3.0,"Even though these are very cute, the posts are just too small to accommodate my earlobe.  Ive never not been able to get on any earrings but these.  Its a shame becauseThese are so adorable!  I love working with wood and the smell of fresh sawdust so I couldn’t resist the screw in screws for earrings as a novelty.  As I was cleaning these they came unscrewed from the top and the bottom.  I thought I broke it but  it just screwed back on.  Im so used to having earrings break so easily so I was relieved they weren’t broken.  They feel pretty heavy, only wish I could have gotten them on tonight.  Been a while since Ive worn such thick stemmed earrings.  There is not a lot of room on the post so I had to  really kind of pull and tug to get post thru, but it wasn’t my night.  If I could make one comment it would be to make the post longer.  Looking forward to wearing these soon.  Don’t want to have to pull out the power tools to get them on!<br />I received this for a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.<br />Before I write a review i usually let the item sit out on the table until I’m ready to “take it for a test drive”  Then I run it through a rigorous set of tests ;)<br />Does it look good? feel?<br />How does it compare with...?<br />Can I do anything else with it?<br />Does it do what it says it does?<br />Would I change anything?<br />Anything else I’d like to see as an additional feature…<br />  And then….<br />I sit down and write my review.  It usually takes me 2+ hours to write--get it on the screen, organized, edited, cut read, re-read, re-edited…you get it...before its ready to be posted.  So, if you are reading this review some thought has been put into it.  I hope this helps you to make an educated decision on your next purchase, and if you have any questions leave it in my comments and I’ll get back to you…Really!<br />  If you find this review helpful, please let click on the button and let me know!"
3.0,Nice jacket. Very lightweight. Couldn’t not use it though because it was tiny. Not at all close to listed size
3.0,Si eres de busto grande NO ES PARA TI<br />Esta hermoso.<br />La tela es satinada.<br />Soy L normalmente<br />Ordene L y no me quedo de los brazos y area de busto. Soy 38C. Regrese y ordene XL. Tampoco me quedo del busto. Asi que lo regresare de nuevo. Intentare con otro estilo.<br />El largo queda igual a la modelo. Y Soy estatura mediana.
3.0,"Cool necklace, but the chain broke after a day of wearing it."
3.0,"Cute, colorful and light weight! The glue came off immediately after unpacking of the circle holding the post on one ear but I will re-attach. I might get stainless posts and just replace them all together—the one provided is a cheap material (not sure if it’s nickle or silver coated plastic) but the earring itself if adorable."
3.0,"My grandma (76 years old) decided she wanted a new ring on a whim.  She's the kind of woman who prefers ""flat"" rings; rings that don't have any frilly stuff sticking out of it.  While I looked on here for ones that met her criteria, this was one of the options & the one she liked best.<br /><br />It arrived in good time & she wore it that entire day.  She hasn't worn it since, saying only, ""I'll wear it on special occasions because I cherish it.""  (Oh, grandmas...)<br /><br />I examined it & thought it looked cheap, which is what you get for the price, but she loved it so much that I didn't say a word.  She especially loves the cute little box it came in.  (She loves miniature things, so this is not surprising, lol.)<br /><br />By the looks of it, I would NOT wear it while working, or doing other things that make heavy use of your hands.  While none of the stones have fallen out of her ring, I have no doubt that if she does something unexpected, a stone will fall out while she wears it.  The crystals do not look as pretty as they do in the picture posted here.  They look immensely fake, & they look CHEAP.  There is very little sparkle or shine, which is regrettable, but since my grandma likes this ring, that's all that matters.  (I've posted pictures of the ring & the box it came in in the gallery so you can see for yourself.)<br /><br />In essence, buyer beware when purchasing this ring.  I'd actually recommend that you look elsewhere if you want a decent ring for daily use, because this ring is NOT made for that.  In my own opinion, it's best suited as a gift for young children (before they hit their tweens)."
3.0,"I get Xtra large cause us tall people have monkey arms and legs, pants too short, shirts arms too t-shirt and too high in the waist.<br /> They think short people have longer legs and arms? No, it's the opposite. Drives me insane. But most clothes are made in Asia.  women are shorter, and shorter arms and legs, but thin.<br /> Models are normally like me, 59 and (used to be 95 lbs) but I'm old now but still have long arms and legs. So this was too short, only when I stick my arms out straight  but still, and too high in my waist. Tall girl's due have a tough time finding the right size so givem a break, it's not easy.<br /> It's an adorable jacket, I am a bomber loving girl, have 2 real ones from a thrift store for $2 in the 80s ( score!) Love them, but we need them longer in the arms and longer in the waist. I'm told my legs start at my neck, but long legs do that. I but men's jackets for that reason.<br />I do love it, will wear it, but in inch more in the arms and 2inches in the waist and it would be my favorite coat.<br /> Oh, FYI, it has a lining, so it's warmer than I thought, I like it, so Cali summer night, t shirt to this, or t shirt to ac, not to hot!<br /> I do love it..wish it was longer in arms n lenth though. Pockets are the right size, too!<br />Five ⭐  if Xtra large was longer arms and length for us leggy girls.. dk purple, too is awesome!! Good colors!"
3.0,"The pants are very short and the quality isn’t the best, but pretty good, especially for the price."
3.0,"Beautiful and high quality bag, but the color of the bag I received was lighter than the picture. I specifically wanted to buy from this seller though there were no reviews because of the dark brown color. Wish I preferred cheaper options in Amazon for the same bag."
3.0,"Lovely and sparkly, with good quality beads.  Problem:  the lightweight poorly attached loop for the glasses came apart.  I didn't see any easy way to replace it as the lightweight bead string was impossible to manipulate.  Pretty- while it lasted."
3.0,"Thread to stiff, nice pattern"
3.0,These will do in a pinch but they don't stay put in my piercing.
3.0,Very comfortable! Not as thick/warm as I wanted but will still get lots of use out of them!
3.0,"The garment which arrived was not the same as pictured.  The back is solid black,  rather than color blocked. I would return it if i had time."
3.0,"I really liked the design in the pictures. In your ears, they look a little clunky. Also, I keep reading jade (that's what I got), but when you look at the Gem Type in the description it says NA. When you look at the earrings in person and weight them in your hand, it's pretty clear that the &#34;gems&#34; are plastic. Overall I'm not too crazy about the earrings."
3.0,"Really liked these belts, so did the kids. But the ends of the belt unravel really bad. We’ve tried to tape them but makes it difficult to put on. I’d look for a different one next time."
3.0,Great price fit my boy perfectly. The was a rip on the sleeve luckily it was on the seam and G-ma sewed it right up!
3.0,"This was so cute. Unfortunately, imy body isn’t the right shape for it. Had to send it back."
3.0,Super cute earrings... but one was bent! Hopefully the company will replace!
3.0,Fits too small an it is not long at all.
3.0,"These are small, so if you have a big head, you might find them too tight. Otherwise they are fine."
3.0,"Usually I wear a large in the shirts but this was actually really big and baggy, I'm gonna get a medium and see if that works better!"
3.0,Very difficult to install. Im assuming you need tools that are not included. Ill keep trying. I can get one side of a spring bar in but the other end never seats.
3.0,Stud is short. Barely fits they hole
3.0,"Single Bar, longest measurement. 7/16th<br /><br />*NOT MULTIPACK<br />NO SHORT SIZES.<br /><br />18G, 7/16ths only"
3.0,"Unfortunately, the fit was not comfortable for me."
3.0,"Very cute. However, very tight."
3.0,"Too small and vendor doesn't get back on refund request, it has been four days since we requested it."
3.0,"Toes fit well, heels somewhat wide; they flop when I walk."
3.0,I thought it would be sexier but its look like a TShirt ... I should of got the black one
3.0,Decent for the price not the best quality
3.0,"This is a nice cloak, it would be better if it had slitz to put your hands through though."
3.0,"I love the collar of this shirt - gunmetal beading over black mesh - and think the fit is flatttering. The decorative buttons on the back of the shirt are a pretty cheap looking imitation pearl. I wish they were similar to the beading on the front instead. The shirt is opaque with the help of an underlayer, but that layer is a lot shorter than the top layer, so it looks a little off. Also, the fabric definitely feels like a cheaper synthetic. That said, this is definitely cute. Order up sizewise."
3.0,"They're cute, but the hands don't glow in the dark as promised."
3.0,Very thin material but fits well & looks very nice
3.0,"I ordered two packages, which arrived separately.  Each set was in a small Ziploc bag inside a cute little gold box with attached gold ribbon.  The mounts on these are solid and very bright.  The stones are clear and bright as well.  However, when the first package arrived, I noticed several loose stones in the bottom of the bag.  These probably should not have been tossed in one bag together, but since I can easily repair them, I wasn't too worried about it.  I didn't think to make sure the stones matched up to the colors missing in the mountings, I simply assumed they had come loose in transit.  A few days later the second package arrived.  The first thing I looked for was whether there were loose stones in the bag.  There weren't any, so again, I assumed the ones in the first package got knocked loose in the mail.<br /><br />Today I finally got around to using some of them. That was when I discovered that although the second package had no loose stones in the bottom, there are many missing from the charms.  I can probably replace these myself, assuming I have, or can get matching colors and size, but honestly, I shouldn't have to.<br /><br />As I said, the mounts are sturdy and both the stones and the mountings look really nice, but the bottom line is, there is a very good chance you will have to repair and/or replace stones.  I really love these charms, and would love to give them 5 stars, but to have so many stones missing is very disappointing."
3.0,Super cute but stitching is too tight. Also not fully knee-high. I am 5'7&#34; with averaged sized calves. Trying to stretch them out before the event I need them for.
3.0,"I got this on time, however there are a couple of things that disappointed me.<br />1) The hakama came as a solid skirt when in the image it clearly shows in the picture that it is like a pair of pants, it also only has 3 loops for the belt.<br />2) The earrings that came with it are crap, just by trying to put one on, the hooks broke apart.<br />3) When wearing the top, it is a good idea to wear a black shirt underneath, the gaps between each button can offer an unintentional peepshow.<br />4) The butterfly clips are really beautifully designed, however they are rather on the small side.<br /><br />Otherwise it is really well made (I actually had to hand sew the buttons to secure them, they were a bit loose) and the material is rather comfy."
3.0,"Quite sheer. Okay Quality, but for the price its fine! I I don't understand though, as to why a (kind of) sexy looking nightie would say &quot;Happy&quot; on it!?"
3.0,Very affordable but I regret the purchase just was a bit flimsy. Would be awesome for a little teen. Overall its cute. Probably wont last or for certain will get lost in a pocket never to be seen again....
3.0,"I wanted to love this! It fit great, but the collar was the deal breaker. I ordered the black with pink trim.  You can clearly see the “inside” stitching which makes it look cheap. I’m never going to wear it all the way zipped up, so this look will bother me.  Too bad because it’s cute otherwise and for the price it shouldn’t be made like this. I’m sure the solid colors don’t have this issue."
3.0,These are okay.  I don't like that the elastic at the waist is loose and I'm constantly pulling up the pants. Other than that the material is comfortable.
3.0,"Your typical cheap boyshort underwear that's mass produced. They stretch out overtime and are very high rise, (so dont bend over in low rise pants or everyone is gonna see 2 inches of underwear). I bought the red, white, and black, but received the multicoloured pack. Fortunately it doesn't really matter what colour it is, but still a little disappointed overall. I was expecting something different from the other products on amazon."
3.0,They were nice and cute and pictured as described but the bottoms were way bigger than described
3.0,"I just got these sunglasses on May 3rd and noticed the crack/brake a couple of days ago, and needless to say, I feel very disappointed and upset. I barely used them and always handled them gently. I've had Dollar Tree sunglasses and readers (at $1.00 each) that have lasted at least a year!  Please don't waste your money on these, the style is nice but the quality is very low and flimsy.<br /><br />Update: I did contact the seller and they responded quickly and were very polite and helpful. They resolved the issue right away and I am very happy and satisfied.  Their customer service gets 5 stars from me!  I have also updated the number of stars from 1 to 3 for the overall experience."
3.0,"Product is mounted on sterling silver 925 as indicated in description. Sadly, the green stone is plastic. It is NOT a cubic zirconia as stated."
3.0,The part that goes up on ear was very tight!! I had to make it wider to fit!!
3.0,great for the price.  I wouldnt say they are super comfortable.  good enough for walking around the house
3.0,"It's just OK, not great."
3.0,I ordered a size up and it still was too snug to wear comfortably.
3.0,"While this dress is beautiful, the lining at the neckline isn't secured/sewn in.  This was the main drawback and reason for returning the dress. Sadly, there was broken stitching upon further inspection."
3.0,My daughter loved it until it broke. She only had it for 2 weeks and hasn’t been able to wear it again.
3.0,Sleeve cuffs are oversized
3.0,"I would have mage this five stars, but the pockets fall in the most unflattering way and bulge out if you do not have a perfectly flat stomach"
3.0,I got this as a lightning deal because I need a dress for Easter and I thought this would be great with a pair of brown boots. I am 5'7 and this dress came to just below my butt. I can't wear this to church.
3.0,i would give watch/phone 5 stars but i have to say the bluetooth headset that is included with the watch sucks if i extended my arm the bluetooth would loose signal ... i went to radio shack and purchased another bluetooth headset and all is great. but be aware the bluetooth headset included isnt really worth having. but the watch now this is a great watch/phone it has yet to drop a call right now i have it on the net-10 bring your own device prepay plan and it doesnt drop signal it works great.
3.0,The dress I received is a thin cheaper material than I was hoping for. I ordered the (25-Deep Blue) navy stripe and the stripes are further apart than I had hoped and the material is thin/cheap/crepey. I am keeping bc returns on stuff like this end up costing more than the item is worth. Would not recommend
3.0,"I've been buying these for years and have loved them BUT I've now had two new pairs lose one side of the nose pad within a very short amount of time. As in, within a day or two of opening them. I'm not rough on my glasses, so this shouldn't be happening. I'm buying another set but if I experience the same issue with them, I'll be looking for another brand."
3.0,I ordered one size larger than what I wear based on the comments in the Reviews stating that it runs small.  And it's slightly bigger than what I wear but it doesn't affect my golf swing so I'm okay with it.  The color of the shirt looks faded and not a rich 'black&#34; so keep that in mind if you decide to purchase it.
3.0,It did not fit over my nose well. I do not have a large nose either.
3.0,"Cute shirt, very soft.  Really thin so its not to keep warm.  But it is really short in the back and looks awkward so I am returning."
3.0,Fit as expected but had to send to the dry cleaners.  Had a awful smell when it arrived.
3.0,It is huge looks more like a thrown for decoration than a scarf.  It is pretty tough so I have it over a chair on my room
3.0,"I wanted to love this adorable dress. It fit well... but the fabric is SO see through that I would have had to wear a tank top and slip underneath it to leave the house in it. It also was an odd length that wasn't to my liking (about 4 inches above my feet, I'm 5'6""). I ended up returning it (with no issues)."
3.0,"They're okay. Soft, and the print is decent. Just longer and more baggy than anticipated."
3.0,Some parts of this vest are cheaply made but over will do for costume parties
3.0,"The material is really soft, which I thought would be really good up against my face, but because of it being so soft, it really sucks in to your face when you breathe in. The filter hole is a tiny hole on the bottom, so you have to fold up the filter to shove it in there, but it did stay in place when I wore it. It’s also HUGE. I shrunk it up as much as possible in the dryer, but it’s still pretty big for me, which really isn’t saying much considering I have a pretty small face compared to most adults."
3.0,"The measurements are a little off, expect the piercings to be longer than described."
3.0,"The electrical cord snapped in half after trying it on. My son was disappointed, but it was fine for Halloween, they still gave him candy."
3.0,Didn't realize it would be so tiny.
3.0,Love them but they run small and my kid does not have chubby feet
3.0,Kinda small but very pretty otherwise
3.0,"We really like these and wanted them to support my daughter, however, they break easily."
3.0,"Length and width are great, but for me the straps were too loose. I have a thin foot so if you have a wide foot or high arch they’ll probably be perfect. The price is great, for the quality."
3.0,It is a nice skirt but the zipper was very cheaply made had to get a new zipper
3.0,Its very pretty bling but too big for my face
3.0,I would order a size bigger than the one i normally use
3.0,Paint piled off sides of the glasses within a month...  didn't enjoy for long
3.0,Looked great. Worked for one outing and belt broke from its attachment
3.0,l got the medi peds and the MOJos  No comparison  The Mojos are comfortable all day and effective.  The medi peds cut into my calf  I am ordering  another MOJO and want to return the medipeds
3.0,It's a great dress but shouldn't be described as casual. I feel it's a little more formal because of the embossing on the white fabric. The zipper is super difficult
3.0,its a little small but still fits.
3.0,"Love this style, I ordered one in black and one in grey, but the materials are noticeably different even though they read the same on the tag.  The grey one has more of a cottony-jersey feel to it and is very comfortable and the black one has a spandex feel to it and is not as comfortable to wear."
3.0,Doesn't fit a larger hand.
3.0,I bought this for my 5' truck bed and it is enough to cover that area with some stretch to it.  I have not given it a good test yet but it seems heavy duty enough for what I generally need.
3.0,"Necklace broke, the diamond in middle is loose, not what I expected, but cant beat the price..."
3.0,Looks very fake and weird color gold
3.0,"I think these are best used ""dry"" ... I don't see anything about them that would keep water from penetrating to your fingers and palm. They're also NOT non-slip, so the idea of using them for snowmobiling or hunting seems problematic. They may be best suited to walking or hiking, but staying dry. Not expensive, but I think you could find superior cold-weather gloves for the same money."
3.0,"Kudos to the manufacturer for making a reasonable jacket.  What I disliked most about this jacket, though, was the hood.  The hood lining and the faux fur trim were--for lack of a better word description-- ratty looking."
3.0,"It is a nice leather bag, I just could not get past the sharp edges of the zipper.  When you put your hand into the bag, they are like teeth.  I wish the strap were a bit thicker as well.  Great otherwise!"
3.0,Looks very nice even though it has some fine scratches on flat background around horse head. Tie is made of vinyl. Good thing it has a flip over latch (which I really like ) instead of the traditional drag through loop. It should come with instructions on how to straighten out the string which is all curly from being wound up in small bag. I can't wear it until I find out how to get it straight.
3.0,"Just another OK pair of sunglasses. Quality is jot the best, but works fine anyways."
3.0,I would say the brush to apply color in your roots but for the rest of your hair this rubber applicators do their job. I was curious that why I buy it.
3.0,Pocket was seen on poorly and slanted. Pockets rarely land in the right spot for me and scream look here! Loved the material it was soft.
3.0,More of an orange color rather than red.
3.0,Product is cheaply made and came apart after 15 min of wearing. Is very cute but poorly made.
3.0,"*edit* Decided to return these. 2nd time trying them on and one of the zippers ripped. No good. Cannot work with these.<br /><br />I have a pair of Shimano CW47, women's size 40 and these ended up not fitting right on the top of the foot and they are size XL. They looked bunched up. They fit well around the front and the bottom so I could clip in properly though. If you have calves with any muscle,  these also will not zip up all the way. These are made for tiny skinny legs and my legs are not fat by any means.  Maybe more fitting for a tall, linky male with long skinny feet and skinny ankles/calves.<br />Pro: they are warm and do their job and I will still use them but next time I purchase a pair I will go in person to get them."
3.0,Meh. It gets worn-out easily. The gold fades away to a silver color and you can see the glue where it's put together.  Also gets kinda copper red is and rust a bit on the part that's howling the stone. I got them a few months ago and my boyfriend stopped wearing his because it made his neck turn green
3.0,waiting to give as gift
3.0,Really cool in appearance but the rubber rings came off far too easy. Should be secured in place.
3.0,very nice but smaller than I thought.
3.0,"They look good but when I wore them with jeans, the back of ankle above the heel, peels off."
3.0,Good product and fit
3.0,"The fabric feels quality and soft. It doesn't quite fit like the picture. The neck is more like a boat neckline and the color is more robin egg than a teal/turquoise. For the price though, I'm happy with the purchase."
3.0,Color is Gray not Green but really well made.
3.0,The metal button broke before I even got the skirt on....I do like the fabric and fit. Time will tell how it wears<br /> and washes.....now I need to find a button and needle/thread.
3.0,"I wanted to love this. Nice color and drape, but I will have to return it because it is too big."
3.0,"Fits loose like a shirt... Nothing like a piece of ""armour"" to fit ""under"" your shirt."
3.0,"The colors and design are extraordinary.  The weave is  heavy which is okay for cold weather, I suppose.  They are quality socks and others would probably appreciate the warmth.  The feel is not pleasing to me. My preference is for a lighter sock in warm weather and a wool blend for cold weather."
3.0,"I've purchased several of these shorts in different colors over 2 or 3 years but this pair seemed to be made out of thinner material this time. Still, I love these shorts."
3.0,This shirt looked like a good quality shirt it just ran very big. I ordered a medium and it fit like an XL
3.0,Very nice but the memory foam is very thin and the size was much smaller than the size listed. I wear size 13 with a lot of room in most brands but these I almost couldnt get on. Recommend going a size up. Very nice otherwise though
3.0,One of the shoes wont light up but my son still loves them and they fit perfect
3.0,"Not the highest quality, but it works."
3.0,"First, I want to point out the production quality of the shirt is NOT the fault of the seller.<br /><br />Though I emailed the seller in advance to ensure the neckline was not stretched, they did their best to convey that it was not. Unfortunately, the neckline is wider than I like, not matching the snug fit like the photo.  The seller has no control over how the manufacturer cuts the cloth.<br />Product quality: 2.8<br /><br />However, we emailed the seller and they immediately addressed the issue to great satisfaction (thanks!!). The seller gets a 5.0 rating from us!  The seller went out of their way to be helpful and resolve issues."
3.0,"I like the way this hoodie looks  but I was hoping that the color was fuchsia, like on the picture, instead it was bright pink."
3.0,"I think this set is adorable, and the material is soft. I'm giving 3 stars because I didn't like the fitting. The shorts ran a little big, and the top not big enough. It moved around a lot on me, and the tie-straps on the shoulders are very thin."
3.0,Nice for the Beach
3.0,"For the cost of the vest being $75, it would have been nice to have real side pockets. The pockets on the chest area are real. That is a positive aspect, but I don't think most people normally use chest pockets to put their hands in. Also, the pins are flimsy. I did fix them by putting the pin part that fell off back into the clasp and putting a glob of hot glue to secure them. Size and color was acceptable."
3.0,"Product did not match picture. It still worked. I sized up based on other reviews and it was still really small. I know corsets are supposed to be tight but the lining in the back still shouldnt show whats underneath. Ot works, if it was expensive I would care more. Size up!!"
3.0,"It is to big for women’s hand, I removed all the expendable beside 2 and it’s still too big. Disappointing"
3.0,When I say small on this top I mean it is shorter than I wanted but will still wear it.
3.0,The design is really cute however there is not compression. I had to keep pulling them up and my legs still felt tired. Not buying this name brand again.
3.0,It's fine. Well made. Stong cloth and zippers. But was a bit awkward. Can't hold much cash without being othersome. I would have been just as happy with a traditional money belt.
3.0,"I ordered the charm with the sole purpose of adding it to my bracelet with my other charms from England.  However, it did not fit my bracelet.  I ended up putting it on a chain.  Instead of wearing the charm on my wrist,  I will have to wear it as a necklace. I thought I was receiving the Big Ben Dangle Charm."
3.0,the shirt was a very fitted cut.
3.0,Impossible to get on.
3.0,Would be cute but it was too large on me. Going to size down and try it again. Good material quality though.
3.0,They fit me waaaaay better than my 2 year old. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch but they are HUGE. Disappointed because they seem very durable for his age!
3.0,Didn’t really care for the material it feels like rain coat. The birds on the purse are blurry and the color of the bad is more yellow than I would like. It’s an ok bag.
3.0,It was too small. I sized up & it was still too small. I ordered a 2x. Definitely check the measurements and size up!
3.0,The acquired a hole the first time my son worn these socks.  They keep his feet somewhat warm when skiing but it's a bit frustrating that they did not hold up that well day 1.
3.0,Blusa bonita pero algo grande
3.0,"I would have given five stars based on quality of leather and fast shipment, but had to take the rating down due to the fact that the pocket liners are low quality and there were gaping holes in the bottoms of the pockets. It seemed that they missed the sewing part.  I hand-stitched them all closed and I'm good to go. Since fixed, I'm happy with the handbag."
3.0,"Ordered normal size, somewhat larger than expected."
3.0,I love the fit and style but the material got Lint balls after worn twice and I hang my jackets up
3.0,Not for long torsos....looks like it would be great for long torso but NO. Not unless you had a super huge chest to distract from shorter hemline
3.0,"Not as stretchy as I would have liked.  Overall fit well, gives good support."
3.0,These cases are too large and they had an icky smell. The smell washed out and I like the clasp but I would not purchase again.
3.0,"The underwear seems to be of good quality, but it doesn’t provide the padding for my buttocks that I need. The pads are too small and stay mostly in the crotch area, instead of under my sitz bones where I need padding the most. The padding that is there does provide some improvement, just not as much as I had hoped. Plus, the leg holes are too big and allow the pads to move away from the areas I need the padding."
3.0,It's pretty but cheaply made.
3.0,"These are cute, the buttons for masks were a little hard to keep the mask bands attached.  I have a lot of hair, these just seemed a bit small."
3.0,"Way too big and I've had other shoes like this and they fit better.  Color (light blue) was only ok against skin tone, so I returned them.  The size was too large to wear anyway."
3.0,"These rings are super cute when they come in the case but I only wore the opal one for a week and it was already turning green :/ I can't get the diamond one to open at all, and after 2 weeks the rose gold has come off of the regular one with balls and it just looks gold"
3.0,"Not as soft as I had hoped. Fit is a little tight, even on a newborn. Cutting them in half helps loosen a little."
3.0,"This is a nice shirt, but it is too small."
3.0,This item arrived inside of a larger envelope with a large item inside so I didn't see the band. I trashed the envelope without even seeing the watch band. I didn't want to provide any stars but wouldn't allow me to share my review without choosing and is why I gave it a 3. Ugghhh!!!
3.0,Goes good on wide feet
3.0,"My wife says:<br />The suit is adorable in person and appears to be good quality. Unfortunately, the cup size on the large suit is too small for my large chest (38DD). Other than that, the fit was good. To my disappointment, I will have to return it."
3.0,"waist is too large for size description, and pouch is too small and pointy. Maybe a 5 yr old package would fit, but not a normal or above"
3.0,"I like the earrings a lot, but they are very, very delicate. They look and feel like it would take very little to break the chain, but since they're inexpensive, that's not surprising."
3.0,Cheap looking. But its nice. The colored pieces move & neck piece is soft.
3.0,"fit in hips, way big in waist/ tummy"
3.0,These straps are well made but a little too small. Fully extended it collapses the hard case.
3.0,"Love the art, hate that it is a knockoff. Amazon should ban items that violate copyright."
3.0,Trouble with clasp
3.0,Nice overall just a bit tight in chest area but can still wear.
3.0,"Runs a bit small, a narrow cut tee."
3.0,I read all of the reviews and got a size larger than I normally would wear. I wish I would have ordered the size I normally wear. The pants did fit OK but the top was huge on me. The scrubs themselves seem decent. The side panels are not the material that I expected but are a good streachy material. I will probably buy another pair in a size that I normally would get.
3.0,I wouldn’t buy these again but they work for now. Listen to the other reviews. They aren’t seamed.
3.0,too large for my 3 year old
3.0,Just okay. Look like the picture but the back is really long so could see that being uncomfortable. I returned
3.0,It fits well but it took forever to ship.
3.0,"I usually wear a size L and ordered this in an XL, wanting a loose, slouchy look. It just barely fits and the weave is stiff. Reminds me of carpeting! Might soften up after washing, but I won't be putting in the dryer since it's already snug and already shorter than I was expecting: hits very top of my thighs, not mid thigh as pictured. The color isn't as pictured either. I ordered the khaki and it's more of a grandma camel color."
3.0,"Fits well and looks very similar to band that came with the Mi Band. But this band comes undone at least once a day, and almost every night during sleep."
3.0,The size is nice however the zippers are hard to use. You have to carefully tuck in the seams so that the zippers don't catch.
3.0,"These cotton stretch briefs are decent but not as comfortable as other similar briefs that I have tried.  The front doesn't seem to have quite enough room and although I believe I got the right size they just didn't fit quite right.<br /><br />The waistband is high quality and the material is great.  It is more the cut that I didn't like.  It could be that if I had not tried other briefs that seem to fit the male body better than I would like these more.  The Adidas brand boxer briefs are a bit more but they were so comfortable that I forgot I was wearing them almost immediately.  These do not really bother throughout the day or anything like that, they are just not quite as comfortable as the Adidas are."
3.0,"Too Small. mediocre quality, not justify the price"
3.0,"The product picture is a little misleading, it looks like it’s a latex fabric or has some sparkle and the color appears to be pale green.<br />The product is a bright lime green very thin and no shimmer. The price is a bit expensive and I don’t think it will survive the washing machine for more then a few washes.<br />But it’s perfect for what I need it for! My daughter wants to be an alien for Halloween and it matches her tutu perfectly! So I’m very happy with it, that being said it’s still not a great product quality wise.<br />But if you need it for a costume I would recommend it. Also it’s a bit see-through and I wouldn’t suggest it for a kid over 6 unless you will put something underneath."
3.0,"I did not receive this bag for free or at a discount like 99 percent of the other reviewers. This is a nice hanging bag that has lots of pockets. I like the outer material. It seems larger than I expected. A nice convenient touch is that some of the pockets are divided by velcro, so that you can make the pocket bigger or smaller depending on your need. But the zippers on each row, open across the entire row. There are no individually zipped small pockets. I haven't used it yet so I don't know how it will stand up during my trip.  The zippers though are a bit questionable. They seem like the cheap plastic zip type that break easily, we shall see. The move open and close smoothly on the new unused bag, not sure how they will do with a lot of stuff packed in them. After my trip if this product is still being sold I will update with a report on my experience. If it wears well, i will upgrade the star count."
3.0,"It was very thick and smelled funny. Like chemicals, even after washing."
3.0,"Fit is good. I wish the material was softer. Feels cheap, but it is so that's expected"
3.0,Cons: All round sizing needs improvement. The weight of fabric could improve and is lacking.<br /><br />Pros: Material and style.<br /><br />Suggested: Using a U.S. sizing standard.
3.0,"These masks for a pre-wash before wear. As my pictures show the edges on the mask are already unraveling. I think the stitch length and tightness on the seam are too long and loose. I can't speak too much for the wear, as I haven't really had the chance."
3.0,This was bought for my daughters Halloween costume. I order the suggested size a M for her by what the size chart said and it was still too short. Luckily she wore boots so you couldn’t tell as much
3.0,"Product is very small, more for a young girl versus adult"
3.0,their more like a small med ...they fit my daughter....
3.0,"Looks great, but the color faded after a month."
3.0,"Works well... but the quality just isn't there, for this price point.<br /><br />2 of the cells have broken through and some of the stitching is getting flymsie after just 2 months. I followed all instruction and only use the vest indoors."
3.0,Way too big. Ordered medium and they are huge.
3.0,"Pros are that it's comfy, lightweight, and has pretty fabric.  Cons are that it's cut a little small and only has ONE pocket.  Should have bypassed the preferred fabric and ordered the two pocket instead."
3.0,I like the fabric on this. Feel like I could twirl. It was too big and sadly I must return
3.0,Dispersed was way too small. In a little too deep. Cute style I did send it back
3.0,It’s OK for what it is but the print is blurry and not crisp. Which takes away 50% if not more of the value for me. The key hook thingy could have been chosen better. Cut myself trying to add a keychain. There are better lanyards for Marines out there to show our pride. There’s really nothing more to say about this but Amazon is stupid and is making me. Write a 100 word essay. So tell me how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Also did you know that the plural of ox is oxen? 2+2 =4 as well and if this dumb thing doesn’t stop making me type More nonsense on here I’m just going to upload a video of someone getting mauled by a baby tiger
3.0,Very flimsy but OK for a costume.
3.0,"I bought these colors to go with a suit. I present for 1 1/5 hours. I was continually pulling it back up to the top of the bridge of my nose. There should have been more material from the nose to the chin becasue when moving my mouth, it would slip down.  Also, the ear elastic was small for anyone with a wide face. I had to take off the plastic adjusters so the elastic would fit comfortably on my ears."
3.0,shirt fits tight around the middle and chest. I usually wear a L. I ordered an XL and that was tight.
3.0,I have sent the medium back and ordered a small. Hoping it fits. The medium is more like an xl. I however liked the style enough to try again.
3.0,"I received one with a defective design. As shown in the photo, the pink ghost is like smeared or chipped. Other than that, the rest of the item was good."
3.0,"This dress was ok. You get what you pay for here. It’s super thin and light weight , so nice for summer or for layering. The fabric is what docked the rating. It’s super cheap polyester material. I’m going to keep it cause it’s cute with boots and a sweater. Just not by itself."
3.0,I love the top but threw away the bottom.
3.0,I like it but its a little short.
3.0,It ran small but loved the dress if I went up a size it would be to low cut
3.0,"This did NOT come with the box packaging it literally came in plastic wrapping. As far as the necklace it is like more of a thicker ""pearl"" than dainty ones."
3.0,My wife liked the hat and the color but the one we received didn't have the turquoise colored beads and braided hatband shown in the picture and described in the information. I was attracted to this hat because of the beads. Probably won't return it but I'm not happy about the switch.
3.0,"The fit and quality of the material are really awesome.  My only complain is the bottom seam began to unravel after a couple of washes.  There is a double sewn seam so this has not made the bottom come apart (yet), and hope is doesn't.  This is the only reason it stopped me from ordering another one and giving this the full five stars."
3.0,They are fine for a very thin nylon sock. But should be called 34 degrees above not below.
3.0,Not as padded as I thought they would be
3.0,"These  are very thin , short and fitted ."
3.0,"Feels cheap and it's really not made for actually putting things in it. Transferred my stuff over and it wouldn't close and I don't have much stuff, just a couple cards and my license."
3.0,"This fits okay... a bit big, and one strap keeps rolling up instead of lying flat. Cheaply made honestly, but for the price it's fine. Mostly I wear this under old band t-shirts I've cut up."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:aec81f6ddc617b8538d60f89c5e08270]] Advertised as: New improved watch over prior version, app controlled, “2G”, large dial numbers, designed for the blind, visually impaired and elderly with up to 15 separate alarms and the ability to add voice reminders to the alarms. Watch is set/programmed via an app installed on a phone or tablet.<br /><br />First Impression: Attractive watch, not overly large with easily readable dial<br /><br />Function:  The watch can “talk” providing the time with one push, the date and day of the week with a second push and the month/year with a third push.  It can also be programmed with up to 15 separate alarms using the app.  Though it’s designed for the elderly, another group that potentially could benefit from a talking watch is autistic children and adults.  Many autistic individuals prefer a very predictable schedule as it lessens their stress level.  Transitioning between activities can be difficult and the Five Senses Watch with its daily reminders could provide stability/predictability and provide parents and teachers a valuable management tool.<br /><br />Concerns:  The write up for the watch states that alarms can be a “chime” sound or can include a corresponding voice reminder that is set via the phone app.  Unfortunately, what the ad doesn’t make clear is that you are limited to 5 “pre-programmed “messages that announce: “nap time”, “sleep time, “wake up”, “drink water” or “take pills”.  Reading the ad, I had assumed custom messages could be created but I was wrong.  That feature would have been very useful.  I had difficulty keeping the watch sync’d with my phone.  The directions state if that happens, close and reopen the app and/or press the lower right button on the watch to resync with Bluetooth.  I followed those directions but it still took a number of tries to reconnect.  The watch operates independently of a tablet/phone and the app is only used to set and sync the alarms so the sync problem wasn’t a deal breaker.<br /><br />The watch voice is a little tinny and individuals with hearing or cognitive issues may not understand the message when an alarm is activated.  Once a voice alarm begins, the message, (i.e. “time to wake up”) repeats over and over until the wearer pushes on the crown button to stop it.  Battery life appears to be limited likely due to the energy needed to “talk” and my watch decreased to approximately 60% after several tests. Also, when initially setting the time, the watch arms will automatically spin until the right time is reached and that may take several minutes.  A spare battery is included with the watch and the directions claim it is easy for a user to replace the battery.  The ability to recharge the watch daily would have been preferred over purchasing and changing batteries.<br /><br />Final thoughts: As a therapist, I look for products that will serve physically and cognitively challenged individuals.  Due to the complexity of this watch, elderly users will need finger dexterity and the cognitive acuity to understand how to operate use it, especially if they can't see it well.  A caregiver is needed to be in charge of installing and operating the app in order to set reminders for the intended user.  The watch is not advised for individuals who will require assistance to turn off the alarm/reminders.  Batteries will need changed on a regular basis but at least the process is user friendly.  The group of people that will find this watch useful is somewhat limited.  I hope there will be additional improvements as the watch has great potential!"
3.0,"I think it looks beautiful in person. I ordered the Nude color and really hoped it would fit. Not even close. If you have a long torso, this isn't the right piece for you. I'm glad I ordered another top just in case. I'm sad this doesn't fit. The beading is pretty poky on the skin too."
3.0,I like the color and the pattern.  However the sleeves are not to my liking.  I am going to try and change them to be more like the other chiffon coverups I have.
3.0,"Love the color and feel, but wish it was a tad longer."
3.0,"It's an ok product  rhinestones come off,  it took a very long time to receive"
3.0,"I'm sooo disappointed! I've been living in Vionic sandals and house slippers for my plantar fascitis for the last several years and the arch support is the best I've ever come across, especially if you have higher arches like me! (I think the people that b** about the arch supports hurting are either because they have lower arches or they're not used to wearing orthotic shoes. It definitely takes some getting used to and the first week is the toughest, but if you can get thru that first week, you'll never go back to no-arch-support shoes!)<br /><br />Anyhoo, I slipped these on and immediately knew they were different than the sandals. I couldn't feel ANY arch support at all! Like I said, I do have high arches so maybe someone with lower arches could feel the support but sadly, I have to return them."
3.0,"I'm a little disappointed. I purchased these based on other reviews saying that they had bought these for their cartilage piercing(s), but they are too large for mine, visually. If you're one who likes small hoops for your cartilage piercings, definitely look for smaller hoops than this. I'll use them for now, because I needed new hoops, but I'm going to be on the lookout for smaller hoops than this."
3.0,It okay just don’t like the material
3.0,I have other nightgowns by this company and love them but these have very scratchy thread around the button area. I've washed them a couple of times but still bad.
3.0,"Having lived in Colorado, I got to try some goggles a few times.  For the price these are definitely worth the money.  However, the fit is a bit off. I'm female and it's a little difficult to adjust the sizing.  I also would prefer a better color. Other than that, they are worth what you're paying."
3.0,not bad but scratches easily
3.0,"These were smaller, and much heavier, than I expected. Like, heavy enough to where I didn't want to suck it up and wear it for one evening on Halloween... They are sturdy material, it doesn't ""look"" cheap. The clasp is difficult to get on/off, make sure you have a mirror!"
3.0,Fits as expected but polyester material is thin and cheap.
3.0,They are too big for my face.
3.0,fitted small.
3.0,Decent belt at a decent price. Careful of the sharp edges though
3.0,"I like the listed picture however it does look somewhat similar to the one that I recently purchased.  My mother is a seamstress and I used to help my mom with assessing how a clothing would look as a finished product compared to the one she copied from.<br /><br />First off, the fabric is same as pictured  (same pattern and same coloring) - it is polyester and is very stretchy.  Unfortunately the actual design of the top/blouse is a terrible copy of what is pictured.  The ruffles are shorter in length and not as generous as the picture that I wouldn't consider it a &#34;ruffle&#34; on the actual item, it is not as high-necked, and it is also shorter at the hem than pictured.  I ordered a size LARGE when I am usually a medium - it fits like a medium sized blouse. This type of a blouse should also be wider at the bottom (swing or A line cut) but it is not - it fits like a fitted t-shirt at the hem!  Item returned."
3.0,"Son loved it, however the holster and belt are both adult size.  Way too big for a child. And therefore he can't use it.  Hanging on his wall.  Very disappointed that the description failed to mention this."
3.0,The rings tarnish if you wear these rings often. I love them. It is giftable!
3.0,Baggy in the in the front  and short legs
3.0,"Fabric was listed as a cotton poly blend, this shirt was more like a poly spandex material with a slight sheen. It was not a loose fitting top, and I ordered  per the provided size chart.  - It is a cute top but too form fitting for me to wear to work."
3.0,Though I ordered my size it's a bit too small. Great seller
3.0,Gift for grand daughter but tarnished very quickly
3.0,"The quality of this product was poor. The feel of the material was very soft, however the fit of the pants were way too big."
3.0,"even though sizes given in the product description, these were smaller than I had envisioned.  however, I've used once so far i was able to fit a fair amount of items in each and while I felt as if I was cramming the clothes in I didn't have wrinkling issues when I unpacked.  a few of the cube had loose threads from the zipper...only time will tell if this will become a problem.  for now I just cut them off."
3.0,It has less coverage than expected.  I am 5 5 and 120 lbs and 32 c and I kind of fall out of it.
3.0,The silver wolf tooth is cool but the necklace it comes on is pretty hokey. I took the pendant and put on another chain.
3.0,Advertised as examination grade and got for general purpose.
3.0,Fits as normal size.
3.0,A little thin and slit goes all the way up with some overlap
3.0,It is super cute!! But the fit just wasn't what I had hoped. It was really big and the belt just has two loops so looks sloppy if you're a bit larger :(
3.0,These are super tight bought my traditional size and they are like a second skin. I’m not sure why I never read it in the reviews at all so I’m going to let it be known that these are not made out of a soft material these leggings are like a really stretchy/thicker spandex material they stretch like crazy but they are not soft and they do not breathe they are hot if you ask me.
3.0,"Very Large, more like a hat than a hairpiece."
3.0,"Not soft at all. I was hoping this would be closer in material to my waffle robe but it's stiff. Not soft at all. The fit was fine though. I ordered my daughter a large, and she wears size 7/8."
3.0,Item came loose in smashed cardboard box. Had to re-box for gifting.
3.0,"The jeans were cute, but had to return due to the jeans being too short. I’m 5’10”."
3.0,Never feel like they will be broken in
3.0,Cute but very small and can't fit clutches too well inside of it unless you stretch out the bag. The pockets inside are spacious too.
3.0,"OK product, but you'll need to take it in if you need it shortened.  The tool they send just bent on first use and I had to throw it away."
3.0,These earrings are pretty cool! Havent wonr them yet but am excited-
3.0,Mine weren't broken went I received them but the nose grips keeps falling off.
3.0,"A little bigger than expected and thinner than expected. For the price, would not recommend."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful, very flattering and comfortable. The only issue is that the bottom of the dress twists to the right. When I'm sitting, walking, standing, somehow the whole bottom of the dress twists to the right. It was frustrating, otherwise this would be a full  stars. I will update after it's worn again if the issue doesn't persist."
3.0,Not the greatest clasp if you can call it that. Lost it somewhere on the job.
3.0,"I ended up returning mine due to a seam issue on one, but the fit also did not work for me. I found the leg openings to be disproportionately small (and while I am no skinny girl, my thighs are not huge). I really wanted them to fit but I guess they just weren't for me."
3.0,"The color was not such a pale blue that it was almost white. The armhole for the sleeves hits at your waist, so it is a very strange fit."
3.0,Not Long like picture for tall girl
3.0,Got an XL it was still to small!
3.0,"Runs very small, you must size up."
3.0,"For the price the watch is okay. The second hand is a bit too loud. In a quiet room, you can hear it very clearly."
3.0,"The shirt is advertised as unisex but has the look and feel of a man's shirt.  It's not feminine at all.  The graphics were ok but it's definitely a man's shirt trying to pass as an article for women as well.  I knew immediately after opening it, I would return it!"
3.0,"This dress feels like a tshirt and hugs your body at every curve. There is no forgiving in this dress. It hugs your girls and your stomach, your butt and you can't hid a thing. I love Grace Karin clothing and honestly shouldn't have listened to the other reviews. I wear a 16-18 and xl or xxl tops depending on brand. There were some other ladies around my size that said this fit them well. I would have to assume they have their weight distributed evenly and attractively because if not hunnay it shows. For reference I ordered EVERY dress available with and without sleeves in all colors. None looked good on me. It was a definite no for me."
3.0,Material isnt all that but the color is exactly what I wanted.
3.0,"I'm Only wanting 1 Pair of Earrings, and don't know how to Delete it"
3.0,"Really miss my old ear muffs, so thought I’d try these. They don’t adjust enough to go over my head and cover my ears. They don’t stay on if you wear them wrapped around the back of head. Other than that, the fabric and quality are very good."
3.0,"Great concept! Product is a little awkward to apply and the fabric clasps do not hold the fabric/ clothing/socks tight enough and are constantly pulling loose, which requires going to a restroom and re-attaching the clasps with or without removing your pants. Frustrating!"
3.0,Cute. Love the color.
3.0,They are ok.. I was really hoping they didn't look to fake but they do..
3.0,Super cute suit. But was WAY too small. Really bummed about that but it gave me the inspiration to get more active and lose weight.
3.0,Wristlets were too small need 1-2 more beads for comfort length!
3.0,"These are really cute shoes and I was sad that they were so uncomfortable for me. The squeaky hard plastic soles rub the bottom of my feet, and the slight boat shape caused my little toes to tip in and hurt. So I could not wear them for even an hour before they had to come off.  Had to return them. I appreciate the free return policy."
3.0,It wasn't a bag bag but it was not big enough and the straps when adjusted would not stay in place had to put a pin to keep it from moving.
3.0,"The color is pretty, but wash it alone because it bleeds. The second time I wore it the side hem began to unravel, which is disappointing because I thought about ordering this in more colors."
3.0,The jacket was actually stylish looking with good quality material but the US XL size I ordered fit like a US medium/small----way too small for me. The tags actually said it was 3XL (maybe Asian sizes) but it seemed as if it were a young child's jacket. Maybe the tag was a mistake but I'm still sending it back.
3.0,Más grande de lo normal
3.0,"AUTHENTIC AND HIGH QUALITY BUT SHAPE AND SIZE ON LADIES SIDE, I WOULD SAY."
3.0,"The product does fit, but leaves a gap between the watch and the band. It's easily covered by a FitBit cover, but it would have been nice if it would have fit like the original."
3.0,Very small for a child's wrist.
3.0,This is cute. Will have to wait until my daughter fits into it. It runs large.
3.0,"I love the hat but a few things bothered me so that's why I gave it 3 stars. First it arrived very dusty and quite dirty with like crumbs or something on it. Then I tried it on and the entire hat itself is unproportional! The bill is lifted and emblem tilting, the hats shape it slightly longer on one half! Not sure how that even happens. Love the idea of it but not at all what I expected. Great quality just minor issues. The tilt is less noticeable if worn backwards, but just can't wear it forward now."
3.0,"Has a funny smell that goes away after a month,& it is very uncomfortable. ....you can see the hooks in the front through your clothing,l. Not very form fitting. But a OK buy for the price."
3.0,"These are okay if you just want something loose fitting and comfortable, but they do not offer any support. The straps are very long and there is no way to pull them up."
3.0,They are very soft and very cute.  But one of them got a hole in the toe the very first time I wore it
3.0,"Very, very, very short. I am not sure if there would have been a size that wouldn't have been too short for me."
3.0,these boots are super cute and look great on my feet but I did need to size up - I have wide feet and high arches and these boots seemed to run small on me.  After sizing up I was good to go - they look great with cuffed jeans.
3.0,I like the dress but the fabric holds wrinkles and it FITS. THE BLUE IS A BEAUTIFUL COLOR. My 22 year old daughter said it fit perfect but I felt it was a little snug.
3.0,Pretty but too big for me. Had to return.
3.0,I thought the sandal was all leather but it's not. I don't like the feel against the bottom of my feet.
3.0,Looks cheap! You get what you pay for.
3.0,"This sweater, is soft and pretty.  One thing I wished it came with it is tags about the care of the sweater. It came without any manufacturer details or how to care for the item. I hope it is not ruined when I wash it. I have not worn it."
3.0,"The gloves fit fine and feel nice, but the music symbols are printed backward!  I ordered three pair as gifts:  on two pair, one glove is printed backward, but on one pair, both gloves are backward.  Kind of annoying when you want to give them to music students!"
3.0,"These seem to be made for a smaller face/head. They are lightweight, however, they do not fit if you wear glasses."
3.0,Quality v. Price
3.0,liked the product just very big in size
3.0,"Material was a t-shirt material and the small was too large. I am 5'2, 110 lbs.  I returned it."
3.0,Fits great but the design wasn't printed perfectly so it looks slightly smudged
3.0,Um I ordered the yellow and got pink! I thought about returning because I previously ordered yellow and liked it better however it was too small..It runs a small so I’d suggest going up a size! Like I buy my baby 2t and tht normally has a little bit of room..went with the 2-3 top was too short and shorts probably would’ve only gave us one use..so replaced but got the wrong color..might keep pink still debating..both are cute for summer
3.0,"Loved the look and feel of these leggings, Only problem I order pattern #5 and I was shipped pattern #12. Will try again. Wish me luck need them for a Christmas party"
3.0,"Comfy, but not enough tummy control.<br />THESE RUN VERY LARGE."
3.0,"This product is 39&#34; long. I am 5'9&#34; and it was too short for me. I ended up giving it to my mother. The print is a little dull and the fabric seems cheap, but the skirt is well made and real fun to wear. The elastic at the top is sturdy and, except for the length, it's a pretty good buy."
3.0,"So soft and comfortable, and would love them, IF they hadn't shrunk Two Sizes in the dryer. Now they are unusable and don't fit"
3.0,"Got this June 4th 2015<br /><br />It did not take long for the strap to come completely off. Out of the package it did seem like the strap didn't get properly placed during manufacturing. Where the strap connects to the actual ring there are two holes and those holes are anchored onto the ring by two little nut things. On the key chain I received only one of the holes was actually secured. On day two one of the nuts started coming out and eventually the other did as well. Then, a couple weeks later of being as gentle as possible with it, the strap completely came out and was lost. I don't buy key chains often this is actually the only one so I don't know of any other one that is better."
3.0,"I ordered the geometry set and while they're very cute, they tend to come off too easily. For example, later in the day (without changing clothes or doing hair or anything else by my ear) I noticed one had completely disappeared. Couldn't find it because they're so small, especially the back peice which is the tiny magnet. Later again, the other one vanished as well. In other words, they are too easy to lose."
3.0,"Bought the three-pack of these shirts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*The colors are pretty.<br />*They're flattering.<br />*Low price point.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*As another reviewer mentioned, they do run rather tight in the wrist openings so when you pull them up, they get uncomfortable after a bit and leave indentations in your arms.<br />*They run slightly small. I'm a medium and ordered medium, but should have sized up to the large.<br />*The hem of one has already come undone in two spots after only one month and minimal wear/washing (photo).<br /><br />Overall, they're worth what I paid for them but I'm unsure if I'd buy them again primarily due to the hem issue.  The jury is still out."
3.0,"My wife was looking forward to this shirt, she was very excited to receive it. When it arrived she immediately tried it on and found the size XL to be too small. It would not button across her bust or hips. Also this blouse was supposed to be casual and loose, not the case at all. That was a big disappointment. The biggest problem with this blouse is its not being the same as the picture!  The picture and description about the blouse are totally wrong!!! These are 2 different blouses! The one advertised is 70% Polyester, 30% Cotton. Ours is 100% Polyester. Picture of blouse: Loose, that looks soft, ours is a smooth material - definitely not woven. Both shirts look to be the same style. The shirt color is called Grey but what we got is kinda blue. My wife is fine with it as this one is very pretty, and she gave it to her mother.<br /><br />5 stars – I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend that everyone purchase this product!<br />4 stars – I like it. Not everything can be perfect! I would purchase again.<br />3 stars – It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless I had no other choices.<br />2 stars – There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.<br />1 star – I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and do not recommend anyone else to purchase it.<br /><br />If my review helped please take a second and click that it was helpful below."
3.0,Poor quality. Holes in all for corners at the bottom of the purse after less than a year of use.
3.0,"Honestly, this is the lowest I've rated something in a while, and I hate to do it.<br /><br />I never rate something low based on personal preference or user related issues. But these are exceptionally uncomfortable. They feel like cardboard.<br /><br />The design is cute, and they look nice, they're not too hot. But really honestly, I can't see wanting to stand around in them for any length of time.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to keep your feet warm and look cute, these are for you. If you're looking for pratical house shoes to wear while making breakfast on your cold floors, I can't see these being a good option for it.<br /><br />That being said, shipping was fast, compact box.<br /><br />Over all, not bad, but not great."
3.0,This belt is exactly as pictured.
3.0,The dress is cute but made with cheap material!
3.0,It’s not as form fitted on the arms as I thought and not as long as I thought it would be
3.0,Bought XL...I am size 14.<br />Not flattering.  Showed every roll.<br />Fabric light weight and shiney.<br />Size 1 daughter enjoys it.
3.0,its too small for the size. very inconvenient to wear
3.0,I ordered these necklaces for gift
3.0,I had expected more than one yellow rose. Small yet well made.
3.0,"Ordered a medium and it was extremely tight trying to put it on. Looks cute but I could see my lace thong imprint in the dress, I’m not someone who goes underwear less under dresses so that was a instant return for me."
3.0,"These are a bit heavy and one of the pieces came off where it rests on the nose. They definitely compliment a Steampunk look, and I love the blue and gold together."
3.0,Very cute PJ's but would recommend buying up at least one size.
3.0,I'm 5' 0&#34; about 108 lbs. I ordered a small. Top half fit perfect but the hip area was a little too loose.
3.0,These are miserable in even mild summer heat and somehow in spite of seeming to be a weak knit had poor air exchange even for compression socks. Hopefully I will like them more in the winter.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:ca946184f99a8c67b3b8b93e3a9838b0]] Loved this jewelry. I had my nose pierced twice but unfortunately my home closed up both times. I didn’t want to go through the healing process again so I bought these nose cuffs. The only think I dislike is how big they are on the nose. Other than that I love them.
3.0,I ordered a cup size that fits me in other bras but was about two sizes too small in these bras. Also the band is tight. Just sized small in general.
3.0,"I wanted to give these 4 or 5 stars, however, even though that are said to be Sterling Silver, I noticed that the posts are tarnished after I take out the earrings from my ears. My sterling Silver polish rag will remove the tarnish from the posts, and my ears do not seem to be bothered by the jewelry, but it still seems strange to me. They sizes are perfect, they look very nice while I wear them."
3.0,I wish I got a larger size
3.0,Fits very straight I expected a little more flowy!
3.0,Really like this shirt but it runs small.  I wear a small but ordered a medium and it still fits a little tight.
3.0,They must be ironed to look their best & easily wrinkle.
3.0,"I really like these shorts, but the size 34 is too big and the 32 is too small."
3.0,Fabric is nice and it fits well. I’m 5’6 149lbs and I got a medium. It’s comfortable. The reason I am leaving 3 stars is because I did not get the earrings that that were suppose to come with it.
3.0,No bow :( but cute!
3.0,Very petite
3.0,I ended up returning this dress because it was way too long!!! I’m 5’2 and expected it to be long but I was tripping over it! I loved the look and feel but since I couldn’t walk in it.....
3.0,Pretty in the picture but I simply did not like it.
3.0,Not the material I was expecting but they will be good add pjs
3.0,"I love the style and the color of this bag. I just noticed something, though, that kind of irks me.  On the slots where the ties come together at the front, the vinyl (or whatever it is) coating is cracked and starting to peel at the bottom of the slot.  I really like this bag, and I don't know if I want to go through all the hassle of returning it.  I may be able to use a dab of glue to fix it and stop it from going any further, but it irks me that I have to do this on a brand new bag!"
3.0,It’s fine. The quality and fit (a little short in the front) are adequate but not extraordinary. It seems like a standard size (i.e. NOT custom made) with a special label. I’ve actually purchased better fitting shirts from Target and Old Navy for half the price.
3.0,Daughter hates them says their ugly an uncomfortable
3.0,too small for my bracelet but beautifully made
3.0,Christmas gift for grandson
3.0,Thought was bigger.  Band a bit of a pain to buckle...no nignt light.
3.0,"These shed fuzz like crazy, makes a mess in the wash. It's a shame because they are very comfy, but I won't  be buying again."
3.0,I liked the dress but it was too short. I am 5'6&#34; 150 lb and I ordered size M. Top was perfect fit (I am 36C) but the skirt part was too short. When wearing this dress anti-static spray is a must becasue it clings to your body. Ended up returning it.
3.0,"It's a bit too big and stretch too easily, cheap material."
3.0,"These are nice pants but run really small and have no stretch. My purchase history suggested large, but the way these were sized, I would have needed a 2XL."
3.0,Great bracelet fits small
3.0,"I want to start by saying that this is an entirely different material than I though it would be, I thought it was a kind of flowy linen/cotton situation but upon receiving it felt like stiff canvas. I also thought the fit was very odd, it’s like they scaled everything proportional to the sizing except for the sleeves, I ordered a 2x so that it would be a bit oversized, so luckily it still fits, but the sleeves are sized as if it were a medium."
3.0,"Very stretchy, has no structure."
3.0,Was very small gave to my grand daughter
3.0,"I loved the length of this shirt, and the fabric was just the right weight and feel. But it fit a little small (too tight in the hips), so I plan to order a larger size. Maybe size up if you prefer a looser fit!"
3.0,"These work ok —- once you get the backing off of them. There were quite a few that got ruined by trying to peel off the backing. We tried using tweezers which helped some, but not all. Out of all of them, we actually only could use about 30 of them, which was enough but not what I paid for. I don’t know if the backing would be hard to remove for any order, or if I just got “lucky”. But the kids had fun using the ones they could and they looked cute."
3.0,"The mask itself is nice enough as to fit and style, but the red color looks as though it's been sitting out in the sun for a couple of years. The tie ribbons are actually red, which really makes the faded color of the mask look even worse. I have a black one which looks great, so other colors may be nice as well."
3.0,The place where the tie comes out of the seam looks awkward no matter what the size is.
3.0,The construction and materials are good.  Unfortunately it comes folded in 4.  This creases the brim which cannot be removed.  Most hats like this are shipped flat so as not to crease the brim...  not this one.
3.0,Seems sturdy but as far as expected details its poorly mass produced. Still a decent buy for the amount you recieve
3.0,Jill
3.0,Jacket zipper has a problem. When zipping up the jacket on several occasions it unzips as the bottom of the zipper goes up. Emailed the vendor but never got any response.
3.0,"The product is nice and also the fabric, just kind of big the size! I imagined it smaller! But nice anyways!"
3.0,It's nice and different it's good for when you need just a bigger bag .
3.0,"The quality seems decent. Cheap and affordable and I'd imagine not bad for working out. The sizing was incorrect for me via the stated graphic from the company.<br />My chest is measured at 42/44. I bought the XL and it was a little tight, nothing bad but given the way it fit around the abdominal area, it was WAY too tight, and I do not have a big fat gut. My waist is 33/34 depending on the pant/short but these made me look 4-5 months pregnant.<br /><br />I'm 6.2 1/2, weight 212 and I have XL in other brands that fit really well.<br />I really wanted to like these, maybe I'll try the XXL just to see but I'm already thinking that they will be baggy in places and just right in others.<br /><br />The only other issue was it felt weird on my back area while trying it on, but that's just because I don't wear items with this cut.<br /><br />I ordered the NELEUS Men's Dry Fit Workout Running Muscle Tank Top instead and hoping they will fit much better."
3.0,The actual glasses are nice quality but the lenses have an odd tint to them and they cause....color glares? They are weird and I wouldn’t say I love the odd color of the lenses. Still decent enough to wear though.
3.0,It's ok. It works nice enough but little balls of material are developing after washing it twice.
3.0,"The ring looked a lot better on the screen that in real life. although it fitted, the finish could have been better."
3.0,When you order this know that its sent from East Nowhere land on a slow Donkey to you!
3.0,"Its a super cute dress and the material is nice but I had to give this to my friend who is a size 4, and I ordered a large....."
3.0,"very beautiful, we all loved it."
3.0,"I returned this because it was too sheer, frilly & i did not like the feel of the material"
3.0,Got this in a size small but its more or a medium.
3.0,"Good quality, but too small for kids 9 and up."
3.0,Made small and material is not your usual T-shirt material.  I ordered a size xl and would need a xxl in this shirt. I’m 5”2 and weigh 170
3.0,Super cute but runs short and small
3.0,"Hat is fine quality, emblem is ironed on so it looks pretty cheap."
3.0,"Cute gift package but the tie is very small, like a toy.  This just didn't suit me so I returned."
3.0,I should not have expected much for the price but I took a shot.  They were too thin among other things
3.0,Wouldn't stay on my head
3.0,Fits good but can be seen under thin clothes.
3.0,Earrings are very pretty and you get what you pay for
3.0,"Probably, part of the fault is mine in thinking these were going to be high quality.  They are barely above the standard safety glasses you can buy for half the price.  They barely tint and they are cheaply made.  I use them as safety glasses.  Will not purchase again."
3.0,The product was thinner than I expected.
3.0,These are ok but tarnish
3.0,Not much stretch to the product straps are somewhat uncomfortable.  The adjustment clips are difficult to lock.
3.0,worked great but it's sized too small. I wish it came in a large bagger fit
3.0,I love the pale blue color and the bottoms fit great but the top was a bit of an odd fit. The straps seem too loose and the cups are really tiny.
3.0,It looks GREAT!<br />Haven't had opportunity to wear year!<br />St Patrick's Day is coming!!
3.0,"It was a cute bathing suit, however fit awkwardly."
3.0,It works OK but does not stick well.
3.0,Slightly small and not the greatest quality material. But it was cute for Santa pictures!
3.0,"The navy isn't a true navy but more like a midnight blue. In low lighting, it looks black."
3.0,It was OK but I wish the neckline was wide.
3.0,Fits great! But.. the wires on bottom bent the first time I wore it....
3.0,"I like it a lot, but I wish it has a better way to roll it back. Once all pictures are pulled out it take a whilet to roll it back."
3.0,Material and the design is very nice but the pink socks got a hole on bottom for one use(unwashed)
3.0,Thin material wasn’t what I was expecting. The material kinda sticks together it’s not a flowy type material. I’ve return mine but it may work for you.
3.0,Returned. The fi is very “mom”.
3.0,"It was extremely hard to see the hand for the gold in the dial. This was to be a gift to my sister, but I knew she wouldn't be able to see the hands. I was going to return it but my 14 yro wanted it so I kept it. Better have exhalent eyes for this."
3.0,My daughter had a reaction to the metal and it may not actually be surgical steel. - She can not wear this any longer.
3.0,It didn't fit the actual size.
3.0,High quality item but its extremely low cut.  I have a size D cup chest and was unable to wear this.
3.0,The dress is super cute but it's really small
3.0,The patch makes it hard to get the leggings on.
3.0,"I like the socks.  They are not as tight all the way up which makes them easier to put on and off, but still not as easy as regular socks.  I ordered M/L because there was no size chart and I wanted to be sure they would go on, they were much too large (probably Mens size 13).  I would buy them again in the correct size."
3.0,"I would have been very happy with it, but the stone was out."
3.0,"THIS I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED, BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A NOVEL THING TO WEAR, WHEN I GO TO SEE THE ECLIPSE AT THE OPTIMAL PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR BEST VIEWING."
3.0,"Ordered the smallest size but they were much smaller than expected. Maybe my expectation was at fault.  At any rate, I ended up returning them. I suggest from my experience order up a size or two."
3.0,I like but no the quality
3.0,I’m only giving it a 3<br />Cause it doesn’t do anything!<br />Just simple stylish glasses.
3.0,"The bag is nice. It’s much larger than what I expected. I wanted to use it as a large tire purse, but it’s large enough for an over night tire, beach tote or work (everything) bag."
3.0,I bought this shirt as a Christmas gift and I should have read the first review because I really agree that the shirt is very nice but the material is very thin.  Definitely not sweatshirt material.  I'm not sure I will keep or return it.
3.0,Nice pants. Sizing is weird.
3.0,"I quite like the design of this band. It's simple and minimalistic, and I'm a big fan of it being free of hardware. Unfortunately, it seems like it stretches out too easily. Based on the size chart, I was barely a medium, but I went with the larger size based on the manufacturer's instructions. However, with just a week of wear it has become too loose to pick up my heart rate when exercising. If I had it to do over again, I'd purchase a small with the expectation that it would stretch out."
3.0,The skirt fits according to size width-wise - however it is VERY VERY long.  I'm 5'7&#34; and would have to cut at least 4&#34; off in order to wear it.  (I don't wear heels)  I returned it for a refund.
3.0,Way to small  loved the shirt but sized small
3.0,"I thought this was a green hat, but then realized that although the picture was green, the title said black. I have had inconveniences like this with Amazon before and it is frustrating...."
3.0,"The texture is great, but definitely not to be worn with leggings. The back is long enough but the front is very short."
3.0,They are small. I'd even consider them kid-sized from ages 8-13.
3.0,I like the way you latch it. But the gear fit falls out a lot its annoying. It just streches over the watch and forms around it but it falls out
3.0,Not so easy to put on and is not as sexy as it seemed
3.0,"So the silicone pair is my absolute favorite. They’re super comfortable, don’t come out in my sleep and they’re bright.<br /><br />The tunnel pair however was frustrating to put on and the back didn’t stay screwed on."
3.0,"I saw this on an influencer and thought it would be the perfect sweet little romper for this mama. I love the pattern and could see it being great for summer and fall. The shorts were longer and a good conservative length. Unfortunately, the fabric was extremely see through, and the top was very low cut. I would have had to wear a tank under it which would have just made the bottoms more obviously see through. Sadly, I returned it."
3.0,They are cute but too big. My daughter is size 13 and they fit more like size1
3.0,just ok--not great/notbad
3.0,Works great but the sharp high pitched sound when using it can hurt some people's ears.
3.0,"I am so in love with the design and style of these pants!!! I really, really, really wish that I could give it a soaring 5 star. But unfortunately I have to deduct a star for material, bc man is it cheap and uncomfortable and unwearable if it's hot outside bc the fabric traps heat in. And another star for terrible craftsmanship bc the cheap sewn on incorrectly and the threads are already coming loose. I'd buy so many of these if they were just better made and better fabric and I'd be happy to pay way more bc I LOVE the design. Too bad it's poorly executed. But too cute to return. Just won't get many wears out of them :("
3.0,its cute.... but fades almost instantly
3.0,"These looked super cute and I got them really cheap. When I opened the package they smelled really funky. I tried them on and they were not comfortable at all. They were very stiff, like a board. So I’m wrapping them up and giving them to my sister in law for Christmas 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,"ordered two pairs, L & XL.  both were really large, big.  they size chart is either misleading or just irrelevant.  gifted one pair, since it was too big for anyone.  have yet to try the [over-sized L] pair I kept.  quality wise- looks OK.  As in built to last 6 month- year.  Plan to use it @ home and in flights."
3.0,Does not fit like it says. Received on time as expected.
3.0,I loved the look of this shirt but it fit too small. Unsure of the sizing.
3.0,"For my taste it was a little too loose, I didn’t realize that it was described as a camisole so that might be why it was a little big on me. I also thought it was a little too long for my taste. The material is really soft and comfortable. I ordered my usual size, small."
3.0,"Love the brand but these ""lightweight"" hikers are smaller than expected and won't stay up on your leg like all my other Woolrich socks. They are fair in comfort but not good for anything other than everyday ""office"" use. That's disappointing since it's not why we buy them."
3.0,Kinda small for a man...
3.0,"Didn't think to look at size, but I was thinking it was a tie top.  It was not.  It had a velcro closure with an additional string to tie. Couldn't get it to velcro shut..."
3.0,Shoes arrived fast and was what we expected. Disappointed that only one of the shoes would light up.☹️
3.0,I've only had my band for about 6 weeks and the little rubber clasp/holder has already broken.  My first band I had almost 3 years before it broke and was worn out.  I ordered 2 so we will see how long it holds up.
3.0,This was not flattering. It also did not keep me warm and was “noisy” due to the material. It runs very large so order down a size! The zipper has a thick plastic zipper and a flap that secures with Velcro over the zipper. The inside is not lined. It also was not waterproof and absorbed water in the snow. The bottom has buttons to tighten it a little but even then it didn’t fit well.
3.0,I have never seen a telescope so small before! The way they show it leaning up against the book makes you think it is going to be at the very least half as much bigger if not twice what it is. Actually it is tiny! I was so disappointed with it.<br /><br />Yes it seems to work if you can squint your eye enough to look through the super tiny hole it provides. it is blurry and looks like scuffed up plastic is what you are looking through but for the most part yeah it works. I just wish it had at least looked more like a real telescope. even if it had been small I would have been ok with it still just not so tiny you can hide it in your hand.
3.0,"Works, the only thing is that it makes a buzz noise."
3.0,Though I liked the color and style I had to return the dress.  I’m usually a M when I purchase dresses.  This one though I would have preferred to buy maybe the  XL then make alternations to reduce the bodice.  I was planning to wear it to work and as purchased  I wasn’t comfortable doing so.
3.0,Busy  won't button up. Material very cheap and see threw. As expected spending $12. Pretty idea though.
3.0,"I was looking for a simple star earring and came across this one.  The price was good, but the single review that was here when I bought it was strange.  The pictures I saw on May 22, 2019 showed a wire type dangle earring and not a hoop.  They are sturdy and shiny.  I wouldn't say dainty, but small.  There are two different earrings pictured in the 3 for the products and the ones I got look like neither, but are still cute."
3.0,Decent quality hard to click together on ur nose my boyfriend did it for me but their okay
3.0,the rubber part of the watch band is nice but the buckle on the watch itself is cheap and looks nothing like the picture. would have been a 5/5 if they didn't show the wrong image.
3.0,"I thought it would be longer, it's like 1""."
3.0,"This is visually cute but it has glitter that comes off all the time. Have washed it numerous times but it still happens. We had to vacuum the glitter off my granddaughter’s bed. Besides that, it’s cute and she loved it."
3.0,Decent for around the house but the memory foam inside lasted about a day before it forgot everything about being memory foam.
3.0,"The band went on the watch without a hitch, but when my wife put it on her wrist, the buckle popped off.  The holes that engage the pin were really shallow, and the pin tore a divot out of the wall out of one side making the buckle impossible to reattach.  Luckily the buckle from the band we were replacing was a direct replacement."
3.0,Nice fit at a great price!
3.0,I bought the green cardigan and the color was the same as pictured.  It fit the breadth of my shoulders fairly well but it clung top to the top part of my arms.  I like it better when the top of the arm is roomier so that the sleeve drapes downward rather than clinging and  emphasizing top of the arm bulge.  The fabric is very thin and I don't expect the cardigan to last very long.  I wore it with a matching tank top and I got compliments on my outfit.
3.0,The color is very very light but besides that they are simple and cute.
3.0,"The orange is a bit brighter than I expected but still cute.  They seem however, to run about a half-size too large.  My son wears a size 3 and has two other pears of vans that fit well.  These however, are too big for him to wear now even though they're the same size as the others.  So, we're keeping them for a bit 'til he grows into them hopefully sooner than later."
3.0,"The product came as described. With some easy to fallow instructions, But this was definitely not made for anyone with thick to normal hair. It was impossible to use on my hair which wasn't to surprising because mine is crazy thick so i tried it on my daughter who has thinner hair and even for her it wouldn't hold her hair. Conceptually and if we didn't have thick hair this would be fine. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone trying to tame thick hair maybe for a half braid."
3.0,Charm is big necklace popped same day very cheap necklace charm is good quality o suggest you but good necklace
3.0,Good quality but way smaller than expected! Definitely order a size or more up
3.0,Overall my husband liked it. But it tarnishes a bit. not too much you just cant get it wet at all...
3.0,"the sunglasses are very good. i gave them a 3 star value only because of the warranty. it states there is a lifetime warranty. sorry to say there is no warranty. after you spend $10.00 to insure to ship back to them (after giving you a claim number) they tell you that they will give you a credit for a new pair,  BUT YOU HAVE TO CALL THEM TO ORDER!!  AND THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE, OR YOUR EMAILS!! after three weeks i gave up. if you buy a pair, and something happens to them, just throw them away."
3.0,Shorts do not fit like it does in the picture.  They are bigger in the crotch area than expected and they look like they sag.
3.0,I love the style but my zipper came broke that’s the only reason for 3 stars
3.0,I'm going to have to return it. I thought it was a cotton shirt and it's more for summer wear and a nylon product. I was looking for a shirt that he could wear more for fall and winter that would be warmer to wear.
3.0,Flimsy. Lacks quality.
3.0,It was very cute but larger than expected
3.0,I had the case for ONE week the screen scratched on the third day with basic use.  What a waste!!
3.0,"Well, not exactly what I expected, it is ALOT lighter than I would have thought, that may be a good thing however.  The tritium tubes are not as bright  as I would think, but is certainly readable at night. The watch functions well and the only gripe is the rotating bezel, it is very loose, I can grasp it between thumb and index finger and move it side to side / up and down  quite a bit, pretty sloppy in my opinion for all the brand hype.  Now the box it came in is very nice and just as pictured.  I will keep it, and work it hard, I'm gonna find out if lives up to its branding. Oh one other thing, the crystal is mineral as stated on the back cover, should be sapphire at this price and it sticks up from the rotating bezel quite a bit, I suspect it will be a scratch magnet.  Also, the shipping was on time and the seller provides a good warranty but hope I don't have to use it."
3.0,"comfy, but runs big"
3.0,"These shoes fit perfectly and don't hurt my feet at all to the point that I can wear them all day as if they were sneakers. However, I only worn these twice so far and the back of the heel is peeling off. I can simply fix it with strong enough glue though."
3.0,Runs small. Clingy synthetic fabric
3.0,Was a little too big but felt like it would work.
3.0,Looks really good but was right on my face and left a bruise on my nose
3.0,"I bought the medium, pjs run small. Shorts are a little snug around the leg and shirt could be roomier."
3.0,"This was exactly what we were looking for, it was just too big for my daughter.  The small is just too big for her frame."
3.0,Shrinks in the dryer
3.0,"They work ok but crack easily. Also, because there are such large gaps between the plastic pieces of my N95 filter tickle and it my face still when I wear them."
3.0,These run big I bout for my twins and they fit about 1-2 months bigger so I'd definitely size down as they are super stretchy
3.0,"Wish they came up farther on my calf. They're comfortable, just need to be a bit thicker, and longer. I have poor circulation in lower legs and feet. I noticed the difference on a 10° day in steel toed work boots."
3.0,Very easy to walk in - lots of compliments.  I wear them in school and I'm in them all day.  We have lots of stairs and hallways so anything with a heel can be awful after a long day.  The bottom of the toe box and the band across the top of the foot don't offer the kind of give that would make them truly fully comfortable.  My feet tend to swell and the lack of give can leave deep impressions on the foot when you get home and get them off.
3.0,love it but gets caught in my hair so have to kinda be careful how u place
3.0,"unable to wear more than a blouse underneath, which isn't how you dress for Michigan winters.  will never wear"
3.0,"Pretty decent quality, does look like the picture. Very wrinkled but im sure thatd come out. Its a cute look, but much longer length than I expected! Im only 5'2. Length along with the silhouette makes it definitely more cupcake princess-y looking than summer date flirty. Would be good for the right occasion just not for me."
3.0,Bracelet is too big and wide it constantly falls downs from my wrist
3.0,The snap came broken off I should of returned it but I did not want to mess with returning it and then waiting to get a new one but the wallet itself is of good quality
3.0,"I love Stance socks. Perfect fit every time. . . but not these. This no show pair has extra fabric around the heel that is lumpy inside my shoe, and the top of the sock is tight over the top of my foot, even though I have narrow feet. Not my fave. But still a really cute pattern."
3.0,Soft and pretty but ran a little snug! I bought an xl and have it to my daughter who wears a 10 or 12. It is a little big but fit her better than it did on me.
3.0,"It had pretty designs but it's not 100% cotton, so we returned this product.."
3.0,The bottom part is huge!
3.0,"Nice, lightweight and comfortable but runs small. XL is just large. I should have ordered XXL but he says it will be ok!"
3.0,"The watch looks great and is designed beautifully with large and clear face, but the closure is difficult to use and not reliable. The watch may appear locked, but the mechanism can be loose.<br />I understand the company has undertaken to correct this fault, and I would give it another chance.<br />I would definitely give another star or 2 for this lovely design, once the lock issue is resolved."
3.0,"I accidentally broke a button off and the proceeded to lose it. I have visited Joanns fabric store but can't seem to find the right size snap on button. Not sure if anyone has had this problem, but now the skirt is not wearable. Such a bummer too, cause I really liked this skirt! And it's $ down the drain now! :("
3.0,Coming from Klim gear it was not the quality I was used to.
3.0,"Got this as a costume for my little one for Christmas.  It fits perfectly, and is well loved!  However, on the 3rd day of wearing it, the tail fell off and left a hole where it used to be.  I know that my kid used it a lot, but I would have expected it to last a little longer than 3 days.  I can sew the tail back on, so all is not lost, but it's something to be aware of.  The black &#34;fur&#34; lining sheds a lot, so don't be scared if you see something black crawling around the floor after opening this.  It's likely just some fur blowing around.<br /><br />Other than the tail issue and the excess shedding, we like this costume.  It's super cute.  It will continue to be worn."
3.0,Disappointed as it is to large<br />Material and finish is good.
3.0,I am 5 feet tall and 140lbs. I am not fat. Just very well built. My jeans size is 30. So waist is reasonably large. But these pants tend to fall off as I walk wearing them. Especially after one wash.
3.0,I'm a size 6 and couldn't squeeze into the extra large
3.0,Battery was dead when I got it 💔
3.0,"It’s cute for the price, but the material is thin. I love how long the pants were though!"
3.0,"Very cute bathing suit but way too small! and rather cheaply made. I am 5'5"" and 125lbs.  It Squashed my boobs.  Maybe a large would have fit better but i didnt want to take a chance with a baggy butt when the bathing suit is wet.  Maybe I will try again with a size large."
3.0,very stretchy and comfortable. I'm a little tall so they don't come all the way down but they are super comfortable.
3.0,"I have an averaged sized face, they fit smallish before washing, and get TINY after washing. My 8yr old son wears them now. I keep in the car for im while running into a store. It does starts to bug him after awhile. The fabric is really nice, on the thicker side. They seem nice quality, but they do shrink, making them child size!"
3.0,Lasted a year...
3.0,"I loved the style of these sunglasses, but the frames were too big for my face."
3.0,These gloves are really big for women. They work well for my husband but they are super big on me.
3.0,Got this for my sons 4th bday in size 5t. The bottom fits good the top is quiet short but it is cute
3.0,"Bro, I could barely breath with this on. Needs some air holes or something. Other then that it’s ok, but wouldn’t wanna wear for more then 5-10 minutes"
3.0,"These run super small! I bought a Large for my son who wears a 6/7 thinking that it would be perfect. They didn’t even fit on his feet! I had to double check that I bought the right one.<br /><br />Otherwise seems like a nice product...nice and plush, etc."
3.0,Feel good lining.
3.0,"Thin material, nice color, very strange fit. Kept it, but not quite sure how to wear it yet"
3.0,"I loved the rings themselves. Unfortunately, I had ordered a size 8 and the rings were too small. If they had a size 9 I would have just exchanged them, instead of regretfully returning them."
3.0,Irritated me
3.0,"Honestly the title. It's still alright, but there's no definable waistline"
3.0,"Cute pattern but was sheer in several places, you could clearly see my tattoos through the pants. Sent them back"
3.0,Pockets are not attached on the inside so they hang awkwardly and if you put something in them it is very noticeable
3.0,The metal is pretty dull. It’s not shiny and pretty. Would work if that’s what you’re looking for.
3.0,"its actually not easy to put on. to take off, yes, but not put on. I'm very impatient, it takes a while to put on. looks good, though."
3.0,"I purchased these for cyclocross racing. You have to run in muddy, snowy uphill conditions and I was hoping to gain some traction while doing so. Although it does the trick, it also makes getting into the pedals more difficult. In a CX race, every second counts so there is no time for messing with pedals. I removed them for now and only plan to use them in VERY difficult conditions where traction would be a real problem otherwise. You really do not need them for mountain biking."
3.0,I am not fond of the texture.  Crinkle texture.  I kept.
3.0,You want too feel like a beast? Wear these and with the help of any pet your gonna look like one. Keep a lont roller handy
3.0,Very cute for child or teen. I do think it is overpriced.
3.0,"Does the job, but after trying these I prefer the 4 individual ones."
3.0,Verrryyyyyyyyy small. So so short.
3.0,"Based on the reviews, I ordered a size that was too large for me. The medium fit like a large. I ended up giving the shirt to someone and they loved it, but for me the size was completely wrong."
3.0,90 degrees is my go to brand for leggings and other activewear but I was disappointed with this particular pair. These are definitely not sweat proof at all if that’s something  that concerns you. I barely touched my leg with my sweaty arm and had an immediate mark. Not to mention the sweat after doing an hour workout...to make things worse I realized after taking the tags off before starting my workout that there was already a water mark stain down the middle of one leg so that’s pretty gross.
3.0,"Adorable, but kinda small. I bought 18 month size for my 12 month old and he could only sqeeze into it a couple of times. Buy extra extra larger than you think you need- it's adorable!"
3.0,Product was as pictured and arrived in reasonable time.
3.0,"This was as described except number of beed was 108 as oppose to 99. I would have given it a 5 star for the quality but I can't due to the fact that this was design for the Buddhists not for Muslims. This was not a big deal to me but it was a gift for a person who is a Muslim. Religion to religion prayer beed varies with beed count. Therefore, it is crucial not to screw up with the description and bid counts."
3.0,"I work backstage at our local venue and was looking for something better than the earplugs that go in the ears because those get itchy. I always see the children of the artists with these on and I was like hey why don't I wear those when my spot is on stage. I wore them last night and they didn't help. They were comfortable but I had to put my earplugs on with them to quiet down the noise. I'm sad because they're super cute. Maybe they'll work for someone in the audience so I will give them away. I have ruined my ears from working here for 16 seasons and attending concerts without earplugs (didn't want to look uncool) so I definitely recommend to anyone attending or working to get something for your ears before it's too late. Oh yeah and these come with a mini backpack which is an adorable bonus. Not a bad product, just didn't work for me."
3.0,much smaller that I expected but cute.  I will find something to wear it with
3.0,"I was looking for a little baggy pants, these were slim fit, therefore tight. Also, I was charged $84 and it came with a price tag of $45."
3.0,"The material is nice and is a waffle knit as described. It fit as described in their size scale, but I’m not so sure after it’s washed. It’s one of those cottons that I’m sure shrinks. I ended up returning it. It didn’t look Iike the picture kind of loose and chill. It was more hugging than I wanted. I’d order up because of the cotton issue when washing. It did stay closed on top even though it was a wrap top. That’s a nice plus!"
3.0,"This watch looks great but you cant treat it like its a cheap watch it will break, the metal is subjected to bending."
3.0,Didn’t stay in place. Low rise on hips.
3.0,I have a few pairs of Pajama Jeans and the ones I bought off of Amazon fit a little different than the ones I bought straight from the Pajama Jean website....a little snug in the hips and waist but not enough to send back or worry that I somehow put on some pounds.  They also smelled AWFUL!!  I don't know if it's the dye or what but I had to wash these a couple of times and the smell is still there but not as much -- kind of smells like moth balls.
3.0,"Waaaayyyy too big. Also, the whole back in open like a bikini. When I purchased, there were not back pics available. The cut out is super cute though, sexy without revealing too much."
3.0,"I love the bag, unfortunately I had to sent it back; one of the clips on the side broke after the first time I used. Otherwise is good and roomie."
3.0,This fits HUGE. Got a size 18 month but it fits like a 2T. Returning for a smaller size. It's truly adorable though.
3.0,"Do not fit my face properly, the nose piece should have been a little deeper to take the lenses a little further from my face & eyes. Not optical quality. I know everyone has a different mathematical equation to each individual face, just didn't fit me well."
3.0,I liked the price but didn’t like the thin material it was made of.<br />My daughter needed it for Tennis in the cold months.
3.0,"I really like it, it's well made, but it's way too big. I ordered a small and it's solidly a medium. Like a standard adult t-shirt medium. My 6'2 170lb partner could fit in this ""small"""
3.0,not quite the size I expected.
3.0,"Necklace came to me with middle stone fallen off. I glued it back on into the molded spot it feel off of, but the position it was originally glued in was crooked to begin with so it still doesn't look so good. But, hey, what do you expect from cheap jewelry? I still like it because it looks pretty :) Hopefully noon will notice the crooked gem in the middle."
3.0,The beads are too big and ostentatious.
3.0,"Not only are these pretty small at the top, the construction was only so-so.  I can see the elastic with very few threads at the top edge knit around that little piece of elastic.  I'm keeping them, they make cute boot toppers if you scrunch them down.  But overall, not very impressed with the construction.  At least they're soft and a pretty color."
3.0,"I'm a very tiny and petite person my normal size is 0 or 00, I thought that this size will fit me but surprise, I can't even close it . Quality and prices are very good."
3.0,"This piece is okay, but the chain is cheap and a little tacky looking, but I'm going to replace it with my own chain and I will like it much better then."
3.0,"I absolutely love this dress, but it does run small. I normally wear a medium but ordered a large after reading the comments. However...it does not fit well up top for us &#34;busty&#34; girls!"
3.0,No elastic. Really loose. Nice color for work socks but they don't stay up.
3.0,Its super pretty but the top part stripped out after the first use
3.0,"Normally i wear x large but these were way to big i returned two out of three, tried washing one to see if it would shrink but did not shrink. My luck."
3.0,"I was really looking forward to receiving this coat and writing a raving review but I just don't really like it all that much. The color is beautiful and the material is fine - it's just the style.  I didn't realize that the lower portion of this coat would flare out so much.  It kind of reminds me of the uniforms worn by the soldiers in the original movie, ""Wizard of Oz"".  When the soldiers were marching back into the Wicked Witch of the West's castle their uniform coats really flared out around them - much like this coat.  I'll still wear it, but it won't be my first choice.  I received a large size for review and I'm 5'9"", 141 lbs with a small chest.  I also have long arms and the sleeves were long enough.  I should have looked at the picture on the product page a little closer as I can see now how this coat flares out around the wearer."
3.0,"I normally wear a medium, but according to the size chart, I needed a large. So I ordered a large, but it was still too small. I probably could have ordered a XL."
3.0,THEY ARE A LITTLE LOOSE
3.0,"The black band that came with it was not at all a choker. Super cheap. I love the charm, though. Put it on a silver chain."
3.0,"The boots for the money are ok.  Didn't want to spend a lot of money on an ankle boot. The material its made of looks more fake than real and I realize that its not leather and man made, but all in all for what I needed them for (with  leggings) is fine.  ."
3.0,It runs small and the fabric is more like polyester<br />Disappointed
3.0,"I, like the reviewer below me, also wanted to love this.  Unfortunately it is not a true size Large.  It was tight, and the shorts were WAYYY too short to wear in public.  It is not see-through for me... just too small."
3.0,Fits my almost 4-year-old daughter prefectly.
3.0,"This dress is a great pattern and pretty. It for great as expected. The material is polyester… which I didn’t pay attention to when purchasing, way to hot for summer. The buttons are not real and just placed with a stitch for show."
3.0,The size run large so if you wear size 10 get a size 9. The back of my ankle also got rub sore. I had a little cut on my ankle by the time I took it off
3.0,"I don't like the way they fit, they bunch up weird at the end."
3.0,Thin and smallish
3.0,Kind small
3.0,the fit is pretty tight; suggest going a size larger
3.0,"It’s a skeleton screen printed onto a crop tank top. It’s not bleached, it’s still cute which is why it gets a decent rating but I would have skipped over it if I knew what I was actually getting. I’m considering returning it, I might keep it but it’s really not what i wanted. So if you are really wanting the bleached tee look, skip this one."
3.0,I purchased a small for my daughter & its a bit big on her. She's a size US 1. The small would probably fit a size 3-5 perfect but sadly its too baggy on my daughter & too long. Good quality for the price & soft comfy material.
3.0,Farmers market
3.0,"nice dress, but  too short and run small!!"
3.0,"I love the feel of these shorts- the waistline is non binding and comfortable. However there is a big problem as they will not stay up- I’ve tried wearing cotton panties (for friction), silky & no panties to no avail. I feel like I need to wear suspenders to keep them from sliding down!!!! ☹️ So I do not know if it’s the material or what, but am so bummed. Now I want to make it clear these are nicely made with quality stitching with double thickness making them ideal for wearing for yoga, walking or running in comfort."
3.0,"the top was a little too small but the bottoms fit great! although I won't be using the top I definitely will use the bottoms since the print is adorable. if you do plan on using the product as a set try ordering two sizes up, for me one size up was just a tad too small."
3.0,Nice fit but wrinkles after drying.
3.0,"It's a nice cross body purse that's authentically leather, with the smell of leather, but somewhat disappointing if you were looking for something that &#34;yells&#34; COACH. It has a narrow strap and lacks that wider part of the strap that covers the shoulder. It's a keeper and an actual sand color, if not a bit deeper.  The word COACH has no emblem, but a gold imprint. It's alright for now, but....."
3.0,This hat is great looking but ran small.
3.0,Unfortunately my Solmate Socks arrived damaged before I even had a try on..the colours are really nice to the eye but one sock was damage because of a flaw in the sock not caught by quality control.  Manufacturer needs to strengthen their quality control before shipment...
3.0,On the small side and I purchased a size bigger. They’re just okay. Zipper pockets aren’t very deep either.
3.0,"It took a while for this necklace to get here, so I would suggest to order it way before you need it, especially if you need it for a special occasion. Now, this was very cheap so you cannot expect something that look expensive and super nice. This necklace is cute. I don't really like the color, it makes it look cheap. I wish I ordered it on white or black. If you want something cheap just to wear one in while, this one will do"
3.0,Runs small and kinda tight I usually wear a medium but the medium was super tight.
3.0,"My daughter ordered these and when she opened the package, 2 of the pendants weren't on the necklace. Other than that, the other necklaces were in great shape."
3.0,"Ordered XXL, and tag says XXL but fits like a medium : ("
3.0,"I ordered size 3, but there’s are much bigger and flimsier than I thought."
3.0,"Nice fit.<br />Actually love the dress<br />However the one I received, the fabric was thin at the bust."
3.0,I bought a l and it felt like a M
3.0,These bracelets are very cute but have a strong chemical/plastics smell for the first several weeks.
3.0,"Love the style. Bought a large, but it was small. I usually wear a medium"
3.0,"I’m 5’6”, 147 lbs and bought a medium. It fit as expected. I had to tighten the straps all the way to cover my boobs. The fabric is thin but not too thin. The tie at the waist is sewn in. Would have been better if it was separate. It’s ok for the price. I’ll keep it."
3.0,The lenses unfortunately scratch easily
3.0,2 star ⭐️ very comfortable
3.0,"I can not for the life of me keep this necklace in one piece. I absolutely love the idea, just wish it was better quality."
3.0,Took a long time to get.was a bit gaudy. But for the price I can't complain.
3.0,Good for the price.  Material is cheap but you get what you pay for.
3.0,Shinier than expected
3.0,I tried to order a size or 2 bigger.  These shirts are a little on the small size in my opinion.
3.0,"Not much arch support. And that is why purchased them,  I have fallen arches I will have to use arch support inserts"
3.0,"Why don’t they have a large? I ordered a medium, it fits, it’s not too Tight or too loose. Still, a large would have made me feel less self conscious. I look great on the dress despite this. The biggest issue really is the zipper! It’s hard to pull it up, I was able to do this myself and now have to figure out how to get it off. Very cute style, but zipper needs to go."
3.0,Not too happy with the quality of the material
3.0,A little see through for me
3.0,"Polarized but not exactly what one may expect. The polarization is minimal, but the tint is DARK! I purchased these as a migraine sufferer and hope they do the trick.<br /><br />The marketing swag package is solid!! with lots of little gifts and goodies: guitar pick, soft cloth lens cleaner baggie, hard zipper case, a dedicated lens cloth and a large round swag sticker. The arms to the sunglasses themselves were encased in plastic sleeves. The word “Woodies” is emblazoned at the temple neatly. Someone really takes pride in presentation.<br /><br />The style is a traditional clubmaster frame.<br />The weight is balanced, however, this clearly is a “discount” frame in comparison to established lines. The bridge is made of a different lightweight material that mimics metal. Perhaps it’s a plastic coated in a metallic paint? I’ve not experienced anything quite like it. Sorry, that’s the best i can do. The arms are a lightweight wood, firm and unlike balsa. They are sturdy enough. When putting the glasses on, they don’t glide across your scalp. Because they aren’t a molded material and “rounded smooth with a flair.” Instead these have a squared-edge shaping perhaps because they are wood.<br /><br />I wear polarized lenses indoors and out of doors to reduce instances of migraine triggers. I will revisit this review regarding the effectiveness of the polarization- the sole reason I made the purchase. Style is not my concern regarding this review."
3.0,You definitely get what you're paying for. They work fine but aren't very nice quality.
3.0,Falling apart after 6 months.
3.0,"very thick socks which I don't mind but the ankle ribbing is too tight and I have small, woman ankles.  Will not buy again"
3.0,The wig fell apart immediately. I couldn’t even wear it. That was a bummer bc the rainbow wig is one of the biggest parts of a clown costume.
3.0,They are okay not made as well as expected..
3.0,Very cute. Love the style. Very retro with the cut and colors. Looks like “Twister” on a cute wearable scale. Probably wear out dancing.
3.0,"You can sort of see it from the picture, but the shoulders don't extend much past the torso. Maybe that was the intention, but it didn't really work for me."
3.0,"Soft, cute material and design.  But the size I ordered did not arrive."
3.0,Cute but I got a 2x and I normally get a large. It’s still pretty snug! Runs really small
3.0,I didn’t like these. They were not as expected or as others from the same brand I have tried. I think I could find better jeans for the price
3.0,They're OK.  Great for cheap alternatives.
3.0,"Wish the majority of the buttons were larger than they were. 3 large buttons, and then tiny useless buttons.... Unless you need a majority of them being small."
3.0,"Beautiful, sizing runs small"
3.0,It was ok for the occasion.  The sleeves could have perhaps be a little tighter
3.0,The  band was nice but just to wide to fit in the watch
3.0,Very nice chain brakes easy though.
3.0,It is very difficult to get it to release so you can take it off
3.0,"This is cut to fit like tights. Which would be OK if it were stretchy, but it's not stretchy enough, especially at the knees and waist. When I'm being active / doing sports I don't like to feel like my knees are restricted (or anything else for that matter). I'm 5'5"" 110 lbs and found the size small pretty snug. I'm thinking about trying the next size up. Otherwise seems like a nice pant, although extremely expensive. I would imagine they'd be good for winter sports."
3.0,"Socks work, but take very long to get warm.  I going them to be only slightly helpful.  Heating element was only near the toes."
3.0,Very strange material. I would not buy again.
3.0,Pros:<br />1 price is ok<br />2 tan color is good for military use<br />3 fabric is soft<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 neck cuff is too big and stretched out.
3.0,This jacket runs small and the arms are extremely short which is a bummer because this jacket is very cute and warm!<br /><br />The pros:<br />•The inside has very soft “fur” that is fluffy and extremely warm<br />•It has two pockets on each side that have snap buttons to close shut<br />•It has a zipper as well as snap buttons which helps seal in the heat<br />•The hood has brown and black fur that can be removed and is attached with very small regular buttons<br />•It is incredibly warm<br /><br />The CONS:<br />•The sleeves are very short ride up<br />•The fur gets everywhere!!<br />•The small buttons that secure the removable fur trim are so small and very hard to use<br />•The fur comes undone with some of the buttons and you have to keep fixing them to keep the fur trim on<br />•Some times the zipper gets stuck<br /><br />Overall this jacket is priced extremely high for what you get. It isn’t your typical “Parka” jacket. For the price I wouldn’t buy this jacket again! They need to fix the sleeve length and have the fur not come out so easily as well as fix the removable fur trim on the hood with snap buttons instead of extremely small ones!
3.0,i like this tiara but it is too heavy and wont stay on my daughters head.
3.0,"Really nice quality shirt, but I ordered a size small and it fits more like a men’s or unisex small, rather than a women’s small. Very baggy. I’m 5’7” and 150 lbs, for reference."
3.0,"Arrived within a few days, the colors aren't the brightest especially with the black and blue but all are still cute"
3.0,I really like the color and the material of the hat but the brim is too long which makes it too fancy. 😭😭
3.0,Good for a decent looking costume corset but not good for heavy wear or waist training.
3.0,I thought it would be larger and the picture more graphic
3.0,"Overall, I love the dress!"
3.0,"Jockey made the perfect underwear for me but they discontinued that version. I thought this may be the one. But while it does a pretty good job of not having pantie marks on your butt, I find that it grabs at the hips.  I will continue to search for the truly no lines panties."
3.0,"Kind of disappointed with this skirt. it's a super-wrinkly, cheap fabric, and it doesn't actually look like piano keys at all when you wear it. The fabric for this design should have more structural integrity so you can actually see the design when worn-like in the photo."
3.0,The zipper was cheap and it was a bit tight but its still a pretty dress and my mom is a seamstress so she is replacing the zipper for me.
3.0,Straps don't stay tight.
3.0,Its too big for the woman.
3.0,"These run WAY SMALL. I always wear size 11, I ordered size 43 which should be a large 11 or really a size 12 according to the chart. They were too small even though I ordered a size up. You probably would have to order 2 sizes up."
3.0,"They are lightweight and love the material.  However they get very loose and don't stay up.  While the slits for ears is a nice feature, it sits way to high on face and feels like its about to go into my eyes with any movement"
3.0,"Have not used the boot covers yet.  However, they should do what we need them to do...keep feet dry when kayaking.  Actually like a big plastic grocery bag with elastic at the top."
3.0,"Cute style and nice length, but much too thin.  You could see every line from any under clothing. I bought the mustard color.  Maybe with something darker, you wouldn't have this problem."
3.0,En 2 meses perdió el color.
3.0,Tab bit on the small side and there were some dangling strings when I got it.
3.0,"very pretty but not comfortable,"
3.0,"Too small, very difficult to order things because sizes are not consistent , no XL s available anywhere"
3.0,"Would have been 5 stars bc it’s a cute dress but the dress is SO LONG! And I am tall, I am almost 5’9”!!!<br />Plus the black non-washable mark sucks:("
3.0,"I wish I had read the reviews about the length of this strap. I wear my Alta hr on the tightest setting of the small band and this band leaves way too much strap for my taste. Also, the color seemed to be white, gold/beige, and blue in the picture. Nope- they came grey, hideous brown and a pretty steel blue. For the price, ok but I will be buying replacement straps from a different brand next time."
3.0,"Its cute, but has an odd paint smell"
3.0,Muy mala calidad se despintó
3.0,Beautiful Skirt just not really made for plus size. I have to alter the waistband.
3.0,Ring runs small.
3.0,The skirt is really pretty but it runs very small.
3.0,Wasn't what I was expecting. I thought I could use them at night but the warning states &#34;Not for night driving&#34; when I opened them up. I can use them in daylight and wear them until it starts to get dark.
3.0,IT SYS MASTER SEARGENT AND IT'S A CHIEF INSIGNIA. I DIDN'T KBOW BUT MY BROTHER DID WHO SPENT 27 YEARS IN USAF.
3.0,"I like the idea behind this band, but it looses its shape especially in the middle of the band the longer you wear it.  Mine started to roll over in the middle.  I love that it is light weight, by I think it needs to be thicker to keep its shape."
3.0,The fabric is too light. The size is a bit large. Not fit as expected
3.0,Just okay ...  A little too heavy for comfort.  Concept is great.
3.0,"I was expecting a much softer shirt, it is pretty rough"
3.0,"I had purchased the wrong size, I thought I got a 12-18 months but instead I got the 18-24 months. Well my LO is 10 months now so I'll be keeping it to see how well it will fit her in the future."
3.0,These frames are not very sturdy. They almost look and feel like children’s frames. I am highly disappointed.
3.0,WAS TOO SHORT FOR LARGER BUTT
3.0,If you wear a 2X order a 3X
3.0,"The sleeves are made too tight, especially for a shirt that is marketed as being flowy. I had to give the shirt to small teenager, and I had ordered a medium which I feel should have been larger, and I'm a pretty small person myself."
3.0,"Shirt is great, but the tread on skirt was coming up when I got it but good for the price"
3.0,Meh. They aren't the best but at that price point I didn't expect them to be. They  good enough. I probably won't buy it again but I'm not returning the product either.
3.0,Snap not ascbig asci like
3.0,"Arrived sooner than it told me, which I was very happy about considering that my other one just broke. However, a couple days after I had received the charger, I would wake up in the morning to see that my battery was way lower than when I had first put it on the charger. Now, I have to charge it on a certain side to make sure it charges. My phone could just be messed up though."
3.0,"The men's mask is fantastic. Good quality and fit. However the women's mask would better serve as a cake topper or table decoration as I couldn't even open my eyes wearing it.  Since it was purchased as a set, I'm stuck paying full price, but it's all good."
3.0,"I had read reviews before I bought this vest.  While some said it ran large, others said it ran small.  Perhaps production consistency is lacking for this product.  I would agree that the vest I received ran a little small, although I am still able to wear it, and have kept it.  Also, who needs pseudo pockets that are sewn shut? While the description indicated it was imported, it did not say from China.  Where a product is made is something I would like to see in product descriptions."
3.0,It was too small for my head
3.0,"Frames were way too big, looked really silly."
3.0,"Just got our Indian Face Shields today. Ordered 2 of them, one for the wife and one for myself.  They look great...  except for the ends!<br />The ends are cut very poorly and uneven.  Looks like they were torn or badly cut from the length of material that they were crafted from.<br />I plan on having them tailored by a seamstress having them folded inward and stitched up at both ends.  This will give them a much more Proffessional appearance and prevent them from fraying and coming unraveled as there are a few threads already hanging.<br />Would have been nice if this was done during manufacturing so that we could simply wash and wear a finished product and enjoy.<br />That’s the reason for a 4 star rating.  Shipping was fast and arrived in good condition."
3.0,"This is just so-so. I’m a 34B, and this runs a little large for me. Band didn’t tighten enough, zero support anywhere, and lace is loose around chest and back. Material is cheap. When you wash it, the lace fades first wash. Good for a couple uses and does look sexy initially, but not worth buying again."
3.0,These are very thin and when you try to take them apart some of them crack
3.0,Great fabric & colors but they just don't stay on my head. I gave it 3 stars because I'm thinking it's just my head that doesn't work well with these. Lol.
3.0,It was a gift for my granddaughter's St. Patrick's Day birthday.  I'll let you know after she opens it.
3.0,Order a size bigger than you wear regularly
3.0,"I've only worn one pair so far, and am a little disappointed in the thinness of the knit, hoping it doesn't unravel during the first laundry. They're a little snug, but otherwise they're fine."
3.0,I love the style of these mittens but was dissappointed when the top flap kept falling off. I can't even tell you how many times I've had to reattach them. Wish the quality was better.
3.0,Nice but to slippery!!!
3.0,Got them for my 13yo and they started falling apart the 3rd or 4th time she wore them
3.0,Sleeves and length are great but the shoulder distance in the back is small.
3.0,The numbers for the date were too small.
3.0,Love the shape and how they look. Wish the guards on the side weren't solid because they restrict your view and they are not removable so it makes them useless for driving. He can still wear them while mowing the yard.
3.0,"Lovely purse but the lining was smaller than the bag, so it was squirrelly...I had to return it, but had the lining beenokay I would have kept it"
3.0,Si big
3.0,"This fit strangely. I’m 5’6”, 135 pounds. Medium was weirdly loose. Didn’t love it."
3.0,"Although I'm sending this back, I'm giving this 3 stars because the fabric exceeded expectations.  The pattern and color is great also!  Unfortunately, the fit is very large.  My husband normally wears fitted style button downs in a MEDIUM and this one looks like an extra large on him.  He can pull way too much fabric around his middle.  Shoulders hit perfectly, so it's definitely just a large fit in the mid-section."
3.0,Color was way different than pictured.
3.0,"Warm fleece in body, not sleeves. The mitten pet does not stay closed- no snap to keep cool air from entering. Threads fraying out different places and the outside material is very stiff/ maybe cheap quality. We didn’t realize the thread issue until after 6 month old wore it already. Otherwise would have returned."
3.0,They run very narrow. I use a Power Step insert. With the insert in I was hardly able to get my feet in the shoes even though I bought a half size bigger than my usual size.
3.0,Nice quality cute shirt except I had to give it to my daughter. I bought a size up based on the reviews and it's way too big for me.
3.0,"They fit nicely & are good quality, but the opening at the crotch is too small for all practical purposes."
3.0,"Definitely go one or two sizes up. I am 5’6” and weigh 140 and the small was too tight. I am muscular and a runner so maybe that has something to do with it, but I was not happy that they didn’t fit!"
3.0,very big not good form me size should small that is fine no worry ok thanks
3.0,Cute but the way the fabric coloring is on the white area; made them look dirty; returned
3.0,I would go a size down very roomy
3.0,"thick and warm, but smell absolutely terrible. Can't get the smell off and then your hands catch the smell after wearing."
3.0,Ordered these thinking it was one size fits all because description didn’t give size choice - they came as men’s 2xl!
3.0,"If only the boxers were just an inch or so longer, they'll be perfect. They do ride up a bit after a long day of wearing them. Also 1 has a small split at the seam already & I've worn it maybe 3-4 times at the most. But I love the fabric. It feels so nice!"
3.0,"Material is thin and cheap but overall it’s a good dress, I just prefer a Great dress🤷🏻‍♀️ My husband hates it but I figure I can wear to work or some other conservative event, pair with boots."
3.0,"I bought these for Tokyo Ghoul (Uta) cosplay. While they're comfortable on my lip, they're bad on my ears. They make the skin around them noticeably red."
3.0,Super cute and decent material for the price but if your bigger than a b cup your gonna need to size up or get a different dress.
3.0,"The quality of the watch is great for the price. It's been in the ocean, pool, and just normal use for going out, etc.  I'd say I have worn it a total of 100 times over the past year and 3 months.  It was great until recently, when something internal keeps binding up. It will not keep time, starts and stops on it's own, and generally has turned into more of a bracelet than a watch. For the price I can't be too bummed, but I thought that a purely mechanically watch should last longer than it did.  Overall, would buy again for the price.  I guess the upside is that you can keep trying different styles every year or so."
3.0,casual little dress  for my daughter
3.0,I love the hat but it seems very small.
3.0,"It looked great, but my skin reacted to it.<br />But if you don't have sensitive skin you may love to wear it.<br />It's adorable & fit very well..."
3.0,I love this dress.  Very comfortable and cute.  I wore it one time and the strap broke.  Very disappointing.  It was to be worn on a special night out with my boyfriend.
3.0,"These headphones are not adjustable.  I dont know how those teenagers wearing them, but they do not cover my 2 year old ears completely."
3.0,Just don’t fit as suppose to it keeps riding down
3.0,"Cute sweater, but SO itchy!"
3.0,It is ok for the purpose!
3.0,Great looking but the break easily. Get what you pay for.
3.0,she didn't like them
3.0,I ordered a large bc I have a big booty.  These JUST FIT me at a “ large”. They are cute ! But if you are a thick woman you’ll need bigger than a large.
3.0,"This Ekouaer Women's Sweatsuits Set is good to wear lounging around indoors on a chilly day. The fabric is soft and comfortable. As described, this two-piece outfit has side pockets and elastic on the bottom of the pants. What I don't particularly like is the color of the outfit I chose which is not flattering on me and the grey band that emphasizes the chest area."
3.0,"Bought this for my 12 year old who upon opening it, thought it was not as sturdy compared to our other umbrellas.  After only 1-2 days, I noticed a piece of the frame was bent.  It probably got blown inside out by the wind.  I could push the piece back into place but it's not stable.  Overall, it's average quality at best."
3.0,It's perfect but heavy
3.0,Way to tight and a struggle to put on.
3.0,"Pretty skirt, but a little puffier/fuller than I thought it would be. It's also not truly white. The waistband is white, but the skirt itself is more of an off-white or beige, and the contrast between that and the waistband looked funny to me, so I returned it. I'm 5'9'' and it went past my knees. My waist is 30 inches and the size L was good."
3.0,like the fit...like the style... don't like how easily the lens pops when dropped!
3.0,"I had been looking at this dress for awhile hoping it would come back in stock in the black large. When it didn't for over a month, I finally went ahead and ordered the navy.  The material is what I was expecting for the price,  a thin rayon material that will get destroyed if you put it in the washer / drier.  I found the fit to be more generous than the size chart accounts for.  I went up to a L and probably could have gotten away with my normal M (measurements below).  The buttons cleared my bust (I'm not very big, larger busted girls will likely have an issue in this area) and the length was perfect. I wasn't a huge fan of the elastic in the waist.  While it laid nicely when I was just standing,  if I moved around it had a tendency to bunch up and become an empire waist (which is really unflattering on my figure).  My other hesitation with this dress came with the coloration.  The details on this dress are FAR more vibrant than pictured.  If you look at the last photo (the close up of the sleeve) and picture the detailed lavender and green as NEON you will get a better idea.  Which for me ruined the dress, neons don't really belong on a dress with navy blue.  I will keep hoping that the black one comes back in stock in my size soon!<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5’4 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28” waist 34” and ordered this in  navy / Large. I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.<br />I paid full price for this item and wasn't compensated in any way but would appreciate a &#34;yes&#34; click if you found my review helpful :)"
3.0,Boots of good quality & comfortable. I just didn't like that the bottom sole was a bit to smooth. Not enough tread or slip resistant to my comfort.
3.0,"Pros:<br />-Can fit a ton and still slips easily into the frig.<br />-sippy cups (for kids) can be placed in bag upright.<br />-Great color<br />Cons:<br />-Leaks<br />-Leaks<br />-Oh did I mention that it leaks.<br />-Not that easy to clean (but does get clean if you want to run it through the dishwasher)<br /><br />If you have a leak in your lunch it will quickly leak out of the lunchbox and on to your car floor, refrig, etc."
3.0,I love these glasses.. i just did not get the color i saw when i ordered. And that is no good.
3.0,fits nice soft material lightweight only thing about the shirt I didn't like is the decal on the front is just that a plastic decal I belive this product would of been better if it was more of a lightweight printed decal instead of the plastic one
3.0,"Pretty. Good material. Muuuuuuch too large. 165 lbs, 5'5&#34;, DD cup lady. I would have done better with a medium instead of a large."
3.0,Be careful the first time you wash the shirt to remove the pearls. They unscrew.
3.0,have a strong smell and don't have a front or back so they feel funny.
3.0,"Just kept stretching out. It was fine, but annoying"
3.0,The fit is great but after a couple of washes they don't fit like they originally did. Seem like they shrunk a little. but otherwise are holding together great and great for layering.
3.0,They said they were true to size. I couldn't get them buttoned. They looked much cuter in the picture than in real life. I was bummed.
3.0,"Fit and material all feel like all my other pairs of leggings, but the quality has decreased. Unfortunately, this pair seems to be a bad batch because the seams have started unraveling after just one wear. These were washed in cold water inside out and laid flat to dry."
3.0,I like it but thought it was longer on the waist than it actually is.  The fabric has a stretchy quality that makes it wearable but I was expecting it to come below my waist.  Took a loooong time to arrive.
3.0,"Looks like something that would flow, but it's tight around my hips. I'm afraid if I would sit down with this on, it would rip."
3.0,"This dress is really cute and comfortable but the chest area is made small. I purchased the black with multi color flowers, the material in the chest area stretches, but the color fades and becomes see through."
3.0,I loved the color but the stones were dull.
3.0,"Right out of the box I loved it. It looked nice, was easy to install, and more comfortable than the band that came with the watch. HOWEVER, it broke after 3 months..."
3.0,These are ridiculously huge! I wear them anyway-but I get constant remarks on their size (not compliments) from literally everyone.
3.0,"The top part is very nice and fits perfectly. Lace is soft and fits nicely, but the skirt is made of a fabric that does not match or looks nicely with the top part. There is too much of a difference in the 2 shades of blue and the fabric is almost like the fabric of  a working Dickies pants.  Overall the dress fits nicely, but I did not like the fabric of the skirt."
3.0,it’s nice but very tight for a medium
3.0,Works great for quick run-around rain jacket.  It has a few wrinkles and I was able to put it in the dryer with a damp cloth for just a few minutes and most of the wrinkles came out.
3.0,The quality was great . It was a gift for my son it was missing for his trip. LN for Lando Norris my son’s favorite formula driver.
3.0,"I mean... It &#34;cleans&#34;, but it's not like you think. I've tried it on sneakers, timberland boots and leather boots. Leather boots cleaned great, but that's kinda to be expected with leather.  My tims and sneakers cleaned just OK. They weren't filthy by any means. But any spots or stains Def didn't dissappear, even with hard scrubbing."
3.0,"Its cute, but not the most comfy pair of shoes"
3.0,"I brought an extra large to be able to fit over a sweater, did not fit at all. I gave it to my 10 years old grand daughter. She is a size 6 and it fits her well"
3.0,"I love the print, but I have to wear a really long shirt or a dress with them. They are really snug and short."
3.0,"This looked like it could be cute in my size. For reference, I'm 5'4&#34; 130 lbs, 35-27-38.  It was too big to be 'fitted' and to tight to have relaxed fit. Also the material was kinda of cheap, in white at least. It may not look as bad in another color. The fit was so off that i didn't bother taking a picture in it. I was somewhat disappointed.  If you are taller and thicker, it may work fine."
3.0,"Tighter fit than I was expecting, but still looks nice."
3.0,Super pretty. I've only had it for a week and three of the little stones have already fallen out. 2 of them went into my ear canal! I have it in a faith piercing. Going to have to throw it out.
3.0,Nothing like the picture unfortunately .. I'm 6' it goes right at my butt
3.0,Love the color and the skirt part  very snug (XL) had to have my husband peel it off me
3.0,"Well, it's not awful, only it's the wrong house (I ordered a Slytherin), & it says it's not eligible for return. I'm unsure why."
3.0,Love it but the eye is starting to come off
3.0,Runs super small in the chest area. I ordered a large since I wanted to use this as a beach cover up.
3.0,El resorte en la cintura está muy reducido y le apretaba poquito a mi hija de 2 meses y yo lo pedí para 3-6 meses pensando en que se lo iba a volver a poner otra vez pero no le quedó grande. Le quedó un poco reducido de la cintura
3.0,decent product.  But very fragile.
3.0,"shrunk, but otherwise nice material."
3.0,"bought this for my daughter...She is a very tiny person(in size, not age) so I got the small. Her top is too big but we can manage it with safety pins, but her bottoms are tight, but not to the point where she can't deal with it. She said she wants to keep it so we will I guess, but as far as looks, it is very pretty."
3.0,"Love the mask but shipping was way too slow, didn’t arrive on time."
3.0,"I thought this would fit more like a dress - in the pictures.  However, this is definitely a cover up - fits large and no shape whatsoever.  Colors are accurate (Whte with back stripes) NOt flattering and  I am typically a size 18."
3.0,Love this bracelet but it's not held up very well which could be partly my fault cause I do hair and it gets wet a lot.
3.0,the buckle adjustment was hard to use.Other than that the hat was as expected.
3.0,This was more of a pink than coral color and the material it's made out of felt so strange to me
3.0,Nice for my nose piercing but when I say small I'm not joking. Don't let the 2m fool you its tiny. More metal than stone.
3.0,CUTE but way to small for the size
3.0,"I was pleased over all with it, but mine was pink instead of white. That confused me and it took longer then planned to get here; but I think the pink is kinda cuter.so I like it :)"
3.0,"This bracelet is more or less what I expected. I put it on my Orient Ray and it fits all right. The bracelet is 20mm wide at the clasp. The curved ends are integrated into the end links rather than separate pieces. The whole thing feels a little less than high quality. The edges are a little sharper feeling than I expected, and the clasp is not as smooth as my nicer bracelets. I was able to adjust it to fit my wrist without removing any links, so it's also a little shorter than most bracelets. It's not quite as shiny as the pics might lead one to believe, but it has a decent looking finish.<br /><br />It was kind of fiddly to get it on the watch, and I imagine that's mainly due to the end links. It took me about 20 minutes, but it's on there. The bracelet is held on the watch not by a hole through the links, but instead just by a couple small prongs that the bar hooks behind. It seems like they might not have the strength to hold up for very long. I don't think I would trust this bracelet to keep my watch attached to me for anything active - swimming, cycling, and so forth. For casual stuff and office-type activities, it'll probably be fine.<br /><br />Overall, I guess it's pretty much what I expected for a steel bracelet under $15. I'll use it until it wears out or until I decide I don't like it anymore. If I have to buy another one, I'll probably pony up a few more dollars and get something a little nicer.<br /><br />I'll update this review once I've had it in service for a little while, especially if the little prongs end up not doing their job."
3.0,It’s a regular beanie with rollers sewn on. Up close it looks just like I described. From afar it’s hilarious and looks as intended
3.0,"I thought I had found my FAVORITE undies!!! But, on my second order, quality issues after having used them , lets say 2 months (like 5 times each) they rip from the perineum area... I have purchased Obviously, and wore them like 4 times more and they are still perfevt, can't say the same for David Archy..."
3.0,"Very pretty shoes and good quality and price.The shoes were not true to size, therefore they were too small.My child wears size 13- 13 1/2 and I ordered a 1 so she would have plenty of room and comfort but she could not even get the shoes on."
3.0,Was sent the wrong color. Size runs a little big.
3.0,"The belt has good stretch...maybe too much but does the intended job for my pants. The belt is as described, but there are a few things about it that are not quite what I would prefer.<br />1) The webbing is slightly wider than I expected and it does not fit through all belt loops.<br />2) The buckle is thin and the tabs can be tricky to trigger. When buckling it doesn't have a very positive engagement, so it doesn't engender trust. Overall the buckle has a light and thin plastic feeling and suggests it will be a point of failure.<br />3) The elastic band that holds the folded over portion for the &#34;one size&#34; fitment wraps around the front and includes white lettering. This band is ugly and chunky. Given that the belt already includes a small patch that has the label, this is too much branding for me so I plan to black it out. I wish the elastic was sewed on the underside only."
3.0,"fabric is thin, but they work"
3.0,Loved the dress but hung off my shoulders...so sent it back
3.0,Average Product
3.0,"The bracelet itself is beautiful but small. I'm not an overweight woman and have what I believe to be an average wrist size.  However, this bracket was too small/tight straight out the package. I had to leave it stretched on a jar for a few days before wearing it. If it hadn't stretched out I would've returned it."
3.0,To some what small bottoms for great
3.0,If buying this product it runs way small
3.0,Polka dots are much bigger then picture and not the exact dress as pictured. However it is super comfortable and fits nicely.
3.0,"These sunglasses were fine. Nothing special. I bought them to take on a cruise so we wouldn't worry about losing or ruining our more expensive sunglasses. They fit the bill for that. I will say they didn't feel very sturdy and the lenses scratch very easily. Essentially, they are good &#34;disposable&#34; sunglasses."
3.0,"Of you have any kind of curves I don't see this working for you as it didn't for me. The arm holes are huge and make the top gape at the breast area. It's just weird and awkward fitting.  Maybe in a smaller sized person it would look as it does on the model.<br /><br />The material and make are well made<br /><br />For reference I'm a 38D and usually wear an XL, sometimes a large, usually a 12 or 14. For me and my size peeps, I cannot recommend"
3.0,It's small in size compared to the other beads that I have for my bracelet and necklace.
3.0,This was nothing like i thought it would be.  It doesn't hang right on my body.  Disappointed
3.0,"It is an ok mask in terms of durability.  On the other hand, you may find locally a better looking one with feathers and or faux jewels without shipping costs.  For the quality and look of it, was a little too expensive in my opinion.  One could always embellish the mask adding details on but I do not recomend ordering this one."
3.0,It was somewhat strange. Really liked it because of the musical design but it fit long and narrow and seemed to lose some white cotton everywhere. Maybe we got a defective piece.
3.0,"Really thin and I had to sew them smaller because they were falling off my face. As a 6' 1"" 200lb adult male I would expect these to have been more snug. I like the look of them and they're great for hiking or yard work."
3.0,"The graphic being white makes a HUGE difference. Disappointing. Well made overall, just misrepresented."
3.0,"I loved the colors of the dress and it fit well. Unfortunately, you could see through the bottom half of the dress in the sunlight."
3.0,Dress was a bit too small. Size guide was misleading
3.0,The silver had a dull gray tone to it. I didn't love it so back it went.
3.0,the color rubs off too fast
3.0,"Soo...reading reviews knew this ran small...size 3x, ordered 5x..still a bit snug but fits.  Not as flowy as would like.  Fabric and quality nice."
3.0,"This product was advertised as ""easy on, easy off"".  It is not.  As hard as any regular compression sock I've ever tried to get on, much less get off.  This product is not as advertised."
3.0,"I think the bracelet itself is gorgeous but I don't like the stretchy string that it is on and those beads, not the colored ones but the other ones dig into your arm and it kinda hurts.. overall the biggest annoyance is the stretching string"
3.0,This watch is not water resistant as advertised. Condensation gathers on the face with exposure to water. It is also flemsy
3.0,"I haven't worn it out yet. Just tried it on. First thing I noticed was that I had to be careful pulling the bottoms up to keep stitches from popping. The material is cheap - but that is to be expected with a cheap suit. I know I have bigger breasts, but I had hoped for a little more coverage - just my areolas are fully covered - a little movement and they'll be exposed. I weigh 220 lbs and and 5'5. My bra size is 40G. Not sure how I'll feel about wearing this suit in public,  currently on the fence about it."
3.0,Runs small across chest & shoulders
3.0,"The size is nice, ..the green color is better next to a white shirt. But over all- not worth $30. Pretty piece, yes- but rather return it. Looks better in picture."
3.0,"These are adorable earrings, but unfortunately they reacted with my skin and I’m not able to wear them."
3.0,The sand bucket is top heavy so it rest upside down.  The hole goes across behind the starfish. The shovel is chained to the handle.  Cute idea but could be balanced better.
3.0,"To me the picture is very deceiving about the size.  All 3 of them are very small and they are all the same size.  These pictures lead you to believe that they are graduated sizes.  Disappointed.  I would send them back, but it will probably cost more to ship them back, than to keep them.  The plastic does seem to be sturdy."
3.0,Not squat proof and constantly slide down.
3.0,"Maybe I'm used to a little more give in my shirts, but this shirt fit just was not it for me."
3.0,They run much smaller and tighter.
3.0,Disappointed with level of comfort
3.0,Item ran very small even though I ordered one size larger than usual.  Cute print but that was all.
3.0,These are quite small but they are VERY SPARKLY.  EXCELLENT CONSCIENTIOUS CRAFTSMANSHIP. 🙏 SUPER SMOOTH & SHINNY SILVER. 😳THESE ACTUALLY LOOK AUTHENTIC! 🥰 I will buy MANY MORE items from this company for gifts.<br />Havee not had an opportunity to wear them as ALL MY 2020 shows have been canceled. 😭
3.0,"Too short, I’m 5’6” and way above my ankles.  The rise is short too."
3.0,Belt is nice but I order waist size 34 the belt itself is to small idk why because I ask for waist size 34 and and my waist size is 34 they gave me a smaller belt will return for another size
3.0,didn't fit correctly shirt is smaller than pants but all still larger.
3.0,"It's pretty, but it's really big and bulky. It's heavy and it hit my teeth. I went back to my smaller stud. If big and impractical for daily use is what you're looking for, you may like it."
3.0,"This dress is okay. It fits as expected but I’m not a fan of the fabric or print. The fabric feels stiff and the pattern seems printed on. My 5yo daughter liked it well enough, but I plan to return it."
3.0,Material is nice washes nice but it is not long enough for leggings if you are 5 foot 9
3.0,"I just got this swimsuit today and as soon as I tried it k loved it. The material is great, stretchy but not cheap. Totally recommended.<br /><br />UPDATE**<br /><br />After two months using this swimsuit I've felt that it's getting loose around my waist. I swim about 4 times per week so I use it a lot. The reason because I took two stars out of this product is because the fit after a constat use gets weird. The strips are fine, the same around my chest, but it's loose around my waist and my hips... I wouldn't recomend to get this product if you're going to use it constantly..."
3.0,"They are ok, but they have NO cushion.  It doesn't look like there is a whole lot by the picture, but at least a little!  They are NOT very comfy to walk in.  They fit EXACTLY my length, and I am a size 10 in shoes. I ordered an XL, so I figured they would be a little longer"
3.0,"The jersey came in on time, and although I ordered it 1 size larger than I wear, the fit was about 2 sizes too small. I made contact, and a refund was made promptly upon their receipt of the returned item."
3.0,It fit as expected I have a large bust and hips compared to my waist for my size so it’s as expected.  Purchase as you normally would!  It worked for a few washes but the seam began to tear apart so I got rid of it before I had any mishaps.  The quality of sewing is not up to par but the weight of the fabric is good!
3.0,"I ordered the pink colored band and got the indigo color... I will still wear it, just not what I was expecting. Comfortable and simple. Not sure how it will hold up."
3.0,Had to enforce hole for wrap. It was literally just seam removed and not enforced.
3.0,"I love the style and really wanted to love this hat. While the box arrived in perfect condition, the hat inside was quite crumpled and mis-shapened. I am hoping that it will &#34;relax&#34; over time, as I don't know if it's worth the effort to return for an exchange. Disappointing."
3.0,"Colors were beautiful, body fit well, arms and shoulders too smalll"
3.0,The material made it look more like a sleeping gown than a dress.
3.0,These are cute and comfortable but they run small. I wear a 14-16 or XL. I ordered a XXL and it was tight. I afraid to dry it.
3.0,Shipping  took about two weeks has some loose threads
3.0,"The straps are extremely cheap and terrible, but the rest of the dress is nice."
3.0,Thr shorts fit all wrong. The hem of the shorts is narrower than the rest of the shorts.
3.0,not easy to get on or off
3.0,Mask arrived on time but we couldn’t see out of the eyes so we had to cut them out and pin the head to the back of the shirt so it would sit right
3.0,Runs very small order one to two sizes up.
3.0,Gorgeous!! Love the color reflection
3.0,"Love it really, perfect size cute design....but tarnishes quick. Like 1 week quick."
3.0,"broke off quick, but looks good. just get a different chain"
3.0,"I order &#34;golden&#34;, but it's more of an off white. Pretty decent quality on the dress. The sash is more of a belt and does not stay where it is supposed to. The broach is cheaply made."
3.0,My boyfriend loves it I was personally disappointed with it but it’s nice
3.0,More long than the picture is showing but other than that very pretty.
3.0,"The fact that there is no size chart, determining the correct size to buy can be a crap shoot. A size chart for another style Yimanie men's pajama set will result in an undersized garment. I should have been a comfortable medium but it was much too small, particularly the top. I replaced it with a large and even though it fits the top is a little snugger than I like. My guess is that an Xlarge would be better as long as the pants didn't fall down since the chart suggests a 38 inch waist for the Xlarge. The material is very comfortable, though and I like the pullover top. One star off for sizing problem, another off for the unexpected trip to Kohls to return the first one."
3.0,The dress is lovely however I did not get the dress shown in the picture.
3.0,"Washes well, fit well but the wording is not as high up or big. Its low and smaller writing."
3.0,These run VERY small so go up 1 or 2 sizes than your normal
3.0,"Cheaply made,  easy bent out of shape. Easy to lose due to being so light weight"
3.0,"This hat is pretty cool and unique.  A bit heavy but that's to be expected with all the metal glued to it.  My only issue is that the design isn't centered on the hat.  It's ever so slightly off, probably like 1/4"".  People probably won't notice when you're wearing it, but you'll notice every time you put it on."
3.0,Great Price....Look's Great...<br />Fell Apart !....
3.0,Less than expected.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but not for shirt girls. I’m 5’3, and the back dragged on the floor. It just didn’t fit right anywhere."
3.0,I liked the diamond stick this came with but the actual jar of jewelry cleaner left something to be desired. It did not really glisten & clean like the stick does. A little disappointed.
3.0,Good but left design imorints on my legs
3.0,It's nice and it fits well but it's not as cozy as I expected it to be. It might be nicer after I've put it through a couple washes though!
3.0,It's not a bad shirt. Just looks like something Jesus would wear. The collar is so churchy looking. Didn't like that at all but I just cut it and made a vneck with it and used some as staining rags. Does the job lol
3.0,I liked it when I first pulled it out of the packaging. When I tried wrapping it is where I had the issue. There's nothing exactly wrong with it I guess other than the construction of the turban. The part that you wrap around only really wraps around once so when you look at it after you can see the part where it connects to the hat piece and it looks off. If I try to wrap it again it is unable to do so because it would be too tight. I still wear it around the home but it would have been nicer if that specific piece was a little longer.
3.0,Dress was cute and was a good fit. The button that closes the dress to cover my chest came off the second I put the dress on. Dress is unusable unless that button gets fixed.
3.0,"I am 5’7” and 140lbs. I ordered a medium. I don’t consider myself to have a long torso, but the breast support was about 2’ too low for me. The other issue I had with the suit is that the lace is not tacked down on the outer edge causing it to ruffle up and look funny... maybe I need a size larger... I don’t know. Other than that the suit fit well and was very cute."
3.0,"It looks exactly the same in the picture, but it doesn’t fit as comfortably as I like it too. I don’t appreciate how hard it is around the temple area of my head."
3.0,Cheap looking but could work depending on fit. If it stretches anywhere it turns white.
3.0,"Looks like pajamas, but comfortable"
3.0,"I wear size 10N in women's shoes and ordered a medium.  The length is perfect, but the socks are too loose on me to provide any support.  That's not why I'm giving it 3 stars, though.  I'm docking the 2 stars because these socks are not breathable at all.  I wear them for kickboxing, and within 5 minutes, my feet are sweaty."
3.0,"Cute shirt. I don't understand the one glitter on the top in the middle, I think it looks dumb..."
3.0,I bought my grandsons usual size but these run way bigger
3.0,It is loose so I would go a size down. I am 170 lbs about a size 10 and it was big on me when I ordered a large. It’s okay nothing too fabulous about it.
3.0,"Had to alter, petite sizes needed."
3.0,Love the design but it was too thin in material and I could see my undergarments through the dress
3.0,"Warm, but not well fitting for my smally hands. I can see spots where the knitting will start to break open,"
3.0,"I did notice the too much difference, I like the fram, very light and comfortable to wear it."
3.0,"Ordered as per measured head size but to large. Keeping as my ears can hold it up. Since then have ordered and received a cap one size smaller,,, fits perfect."
3.0,This was absolutely not true to fit. About three sizes smaller than advertised.
3.0,Giving it three stars because for most of the night it looked cool but the clasp broke halfway through and it had trouble staying around my finger.
3.0,My daughter LOVED this but it broke after 5 months:(
3.0,"Product is as described and expected but arrived a bit worse for wear. Dangle managed to score the paint on one side of the mask. This can be corrected but will take some time, effort and supplies. This is due to the individual packaging of the item and not marring that occurred during shipment."
3.0,The hat I received was too big for my daughter; I couldn't find details of my order so I'm not sure if I was sent the wrong size or I accidentally ordered the wrong size. I need a S/M but I received a L/XL.
3.0,This dress makes you look huge
3.0,"I ordered a 2X and the pants fit my kids, who wear a large. I’m so disappointed."
3.0,I dont love it on my body but it is a very cute skirt and does got tts
3.0,"Disappointed. It's low quality, not stitched correctly (or at all in some places) and the actual print is subpar. It's &#34;ok&#34; but I wouldn't wear it to work. I found a much better one at Ross for less."
3.0,"Would like it longer - say 40"" long -  and cut much fuller."
3.0,They’re pretty tight on the face and they don’t have much give.
3.0,"Looks like image.  Buckles are not functional (perhaps described in details?), but rather two magnetic snaps.  At first, really stiff and could not accommodate all the IT travel necessities but with a few uses the leather has stretched and able to fit a bit more.  NOTE: Check your tablet/laptop size as I had quite a (frustrating) time trying to get mine in and eventually had to settle on it not being in the middle (padded) pocket designed for it.  Overall it's ok, not perfect....still searching for the perfect carry all, but not too large, laptop bag.  Hope this helps."
3.0,Cheap. Charm fell off when she wore it.
3.0,"Super comfy, but they run super super small. I still wear them but they are difficult to get on"
3.0,"Very cute! I purchased the dress in red and it makes me want to go to Disneyland and purchase some Minnie ears. Wore it around all day yesterday and loved the breathability while doing house chores. Great for the price, might want to grab some nipple covers or a complementing bralette. Small chested women should have no problem going natural."
3.0,Not worth $10 if you ask me. A lot of junk charms and beads. Description doesn’t mention beads. Thought it would be 100 charms.
3.0,"These socks are very comfortable. My feet are a bit sweaty in nature when I wear shoes.<br /><br />The socks become slippery. However, I really liked its ability to absorb the moisture from its feet.<br /><br />I am able to wear these socks all day long during my long work hours. I wear these both during work and workouts.<br /><br />Moreover, the texture did not change even after a few washes."
3.0,"I was disappointed  that there were no grips on the bottom.  I wanted to use them for NIA classes.  Nothing wrong with the shoes, they just did not fit my purpose."
3.0,It is almost closer to a men's medium then a boys XL.  I expected it to fit big but now he has to grow into it and Tom is up in the air for next season.
3.0,The quality is good but I bought one for my 10 year old and she wears a 10 so I got the youth size 14 and it fits her but not for long if you know what I mean I suggest get a small in adult instead
3.0,Very much NOT no show socks
3.0,"The glasses are fantastic, how they arrived, not so much.<br />I understood at the time of purchase, that it would take a considerable amount of time to get them.<br />What I didn't get was that the package resembled the south end of a field hockey contest.<br />How the glasses did not end up totally destroyed is truly amazing.<br />Fortunately, they came out of the mangled box requiring nothing more than straightening part of the frame.<br />The glasses are great. I truly love the clarity and their response to changing outdoor light.<br />I would like another pair someday. Whether they come from these guys or not is as &#34;iffy&#34; as the shipping process."
3.0,"The idea is good but they do fog, so the point us defeated on showing my mouth. They do look nice though. Haven’t really used them because of fog."
3.0,"The fabric is thicker than expected. The sleeve on the right is a bit carved, the size does not fit."
3.0,"Bought for my daughter for Christmas, she loved them but as soon as she tried them on her toes touch the tippy top. They run small!!!! Go up in size!"
3.0,"Very big and shiny I couldn't tell from the picture, I thought they looked like pearls,but they look more like a planet, not my type, but they made a nice gift and she likes them alot"
3.0,The mittens are really comfy but the heaters do not work!
3.0,not meant for young girls not yet developed.
3.0,"My husband was thrilled to bits when I gave him this shirt! He loves it, and it fits perfect. The logo is on there nicely and seemed like a nice quality shirt. However he turned his wrist and said &#34;had you noticed this?&#34; There was a tear from the cuff of the sleeve about an inch up. And of course it was a Christmas gift that I had ordered a month before hand so I couldn't return it. He enjoys wearing it, so I am glad for that, just super disappointed that they would send a shirt that was ripped. Be sure to check yours over!"
3.0,I bought this to use at Disney World. It ended up being very uncomfortable on my shoulder and neck.
3.0,"Cute dress. Seems like a belt would make it look better, it is longer than expected"
3.0,This bad isn't as thick as the original and thus my watch comes off in the middle of the night when I sleep.  I find it on the floor every morning.
3.0,"I found this to be adorable and a great gift for friends, but as a keychain I put on my keys. Only a few days after having it I dropped my keys and the pot broke right off from the cactus. This product was too fragile for my daily handling."
3.0,I was a bit nervous about this fitting properly.  However it does fit very well I am 5'9 bout 185 34c-30-44.  However its more of a leotard than a bathing suit.  Its not lined at all.  Not sure how it would do wet.
3.0,I wish the handle was big enough to go over my wrist. The bar fell off the first day I used it. Luckily I didn’t have anything on it so I just lost that part of the keychain.
3.0,I expected it to be more sturdy. Its flimsy so it snags and bends...
3.0,This was to small but other than that ai love this peice. Looks exactly like it says it does and the fabric is nocr.
3.0,"Unfortunately, these were too small to wear over my prescription glasses. The box says they have a larger size but I couldn't find them on Amazon or using Google search. The lenses seemed to have a calming effect that did help my migraines. I just wish they fit over my glasses so I could wear them out in public without looking ridiculous. Due to small size, I chose to return. They were too pricey to only keep them to wear at home."
3.0,"I had high hopes for this bra.<br /><br />Sadly, like many bras without the dreaded underwire, you look like you have a mountain range instead of two individual peaks.<br /><br />The size was okay. I usually where 36, so I ordered the large. Still, I had to go to the latch clasp. It did come with an extender, though, so if you need it, that's a plus.<br /><br />Also, the pads look like they come out--there's a slit--but they are sewn in.<br /><br />Again, comfortable but definitely not worth $49.99 if you're looking for something defining and flattering.<br /><br />I won't be getting additional colors."
3.0,Not good quality. Material very thin
3.0,The watch and clasp does not stay locked when on. It has to be rematches often.
3.0,"Very cute looks jus toile the picture, unfortunately material is very cheap and doesn’t feel well on skin (must be polyester). Also the dress is not lined, so the polkadots in the inside are the backside on the material and can be Seen through near the neckline."
3.0,Way too big and no way of taking a link out to make it not fall off my wrist. The face of the watch it too big as well. This watch was designed for a large woman or a man. It's a nice watch though.
3.0,Really not happy w/color a ugly yellow and very thin material
3.0,White is too thin/show through
3.0,"This dress style is great for my pear shaped body, but this particular dress was poorly made and fit strangely.<br />FANTASTIC SELLER!!!!! I highly recommend this seller. They made my return and refund so easy. I will be a return customer for sure."
3.0,The elastic in the back isn't very tight.  It won't stay on my head
3.0,Its not to bad. I will wear it.
3.0,"Not flattering. Cheap Asian feel, no style at all. Looked like a sleep-shirt."
3.0,It kept breaking
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:35cc86ddb1ccfa427d7b4817aa27764a]] Helpful for anxiety and remembering to stop and breathe when ya get caught up in stress, the price for this very simple unit is a bit of a stretch though. There is nothing terribly exciting or unique about it, it's merely a hollow tube and feels much like a straw  when breathing through it. Personally, while it's helpful, I can cut a metal straw, soften up the edges, poke a couple holes for the necklace portion, and have the same effects as this without spending $40+. Not worth it tbh."
3.0,The color is WAY darker than pictured.
3.0,"In the picture, the shell looks shiny gold & cream, but in person the shell is brown and cream (see picture).  The description says the shell is 3 inches, the shell measures 2 inches, 2 1/2 including the bail.  The shell is advertised as a Nautilus shell, but it does not have the characteristic spiral of a Nautilus shell (see picture).  The shell is pretty, but not what I thought I was buying.  Too much hassle to send back, so I will keep it, but cannot use it for the intended costume purpose.  The product description should be updated and a better picture taken of the product for future customers. Item came in a gift bag which was a nice touch."
3.0,More of a light shirt. Not sure how this will keep anyone warm.
3.0,Adorable cheap material
3.0,Love the earrings . I received them in my mail box and was unhappy with the fact the post on the back of the earrings were bent . If it wasn't for that I would recommend them
3.0,Pretty top but very thin material
3.0,"It's a very pretty shirt, but it had a funny color to it (I ordered white). Almost like it had been washed with something pink or red."
3.0,material is thin
3.0,cute but I'm not sure about the quality.  Value for the money is still good even if they only last 1 year!
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:c4df25ad1f3d024e35262b293d878ac8]] The scarf is not the one you see on the picture. It didn't bring the gryffindor insignia on the scarf. Was very dissapointed  about it. Apart from the scarf, other stuff looks good an usable.  The wand is a little to big for my liking an it looks really fake plastic but its understandable. Other then that everything looks good  to use. Wouldn't give it as a gift unless is a child who won't know the difference an that is only for playing. Loved the necklace time Turner, very cute."
3.0,Cheaply made but was a funny birthday gift.
3.0,They shrink horribly but they are really fun.  I have had a pair for 8 years and wear them all the time.
3.0,The glasses of are of good quality. The only downfall was that it arrived with just one lens.
3.0,"It was great while I had it! Super cute! Unfortunately, I would wear it almost daily, and it broke within a few months :("
3.0,2 sizes too big but it's cute. Can't go wrong for the price
3.0,"Quality of Cardigan and price match. It's very light weight with soft to the touch material. If a person is cold natured, this is not for you."
3.0,"Definitely not as pictured. Very disappointing, returned item"
3.0,The black finish wears thin after a couple months of use.
3.0,"Couldn't tell by the picture, but in person when trying it on I think the pointy gems are a bit much. Wasn't really what I was looking for. Good quality and fast delivery though."
3.0,"Decent fit.  The fabric is kinda cheap, but it's ok."
3.0,My daughter loves the shoes but they are huge. It will literally take years for them to fit. The strap keeps them on her feet though. So far they have held up.
3.0,Disappointed that my sunglasses were too large for this case. Keeping it still because my prescription glasses are smaller and it will work for them.
3.0,Arms are too small. It looks like a nightgown in real life.
3.0,Somewhat small.. material and fit aren’t anything to write home about.
3.0,"The bands are very nice and what I was looking for, however two of the bands were not the colors that was supposed to be in the package. I was really looking forward to the hunter green and orange bands."
3.0,Slightly girlish.
3.0,"Looked really cute, but didn’t like the feel of the fabric so I returned it.  It seemed like a dressier fabric, not something I would wear to the beach. Returns were very easy though."
3.0,"Looks cute, but definitely size up when ordering. I usually have no issues with my size, even if they come &#34;smaller&#34; or &#34;larger&#34;. This is the first time I've ever not been able to wear my own size!"
3.0,These are pretty good but one of them was tight around one of my toes. They work well with non skid during yoga.
3.0,"I got my daughter I have 1/2 size bigger than she usually wears, so she can use them for a little bit,  but their to small."
3.0,I received a replacement that was better quality albeit not the color I originally purchased.
3.0,"I was excited to receive the product, but was disappointed that there was a flawed crystal right in the middle of the leaf.  It is very obvious and actually wrecks the necklace which would have otherwise have looked good.  Very bummed!"
3.0,"Fits perfectly, the quality of the print out is not that good but I still like it."
3.0,"I actually went up in size because I wanted it loose. It was too snug for what I wanted. Very pretty, but I had to return it."
3.0,"Size 12, but slim. Ordered an XL-32. Too short for my long legs and runs small. Also the waist is NOT high waist. Disappointed, but will wear around the house, not outside.. Sending it back is a hassle. Must do better!"
3.0,It's ok. But it runs really small. And my daughters size was the largest they made so I couldn't exchange for a bigger one
3.0,"The hat is very pretty. The crown is crocheted and the brim is plastic straw. The back decoration is wired organza as is the hat band. HOWEVER, the hat arrived in an envelope!  It's flat and has heavy fold lines. The decoration is also crushed. The hat band is applied crooked. I'll try using steam to work out some of the folds, otherwise back it goes. Very disappointing as I think the hat is adorable."
3.0,So First I don't know why I see 5 stars on this un less you purchased it for kid. This is more for kids than adults. Is a cut out pice of neoprene with a picture laminate to it over the light board.  If it just for you to wear when you go out with your kids and don't want to spend a lot. Then is ok. The only thing is that the lights will only light up with sound so make sure you have music playing while using it otherwisethe lights won't work. The eye holes are a bit to close to each other with you'll get use too. It will definitely be a great mask if you having a party where music is playing.  The pictures are to show how the mask light up while music is playing.
3.0,The ring came fast however a stone was fracked when it arrived and its sooo noticeable! The ring could be a very pretty ring but it looks awful! I can't imagine someone sent this out thinking a customer would be satisfied with it esthecially! very disappointed!
3.0,Too large & bulky
3.0,"While this was a cute little onsie, it was huge. My daughter generally wears a 2T. She is 20 months and very tall. The 24 month onesie swallowed her. Other than that issue, it was really cute"
3.0,"Too large. Half size too big, we had to return it for a smaller size. Otherwise it's ok"
3.0,Didn't fit as comfortable as a HJC helmet.  For short 10 min rides it's fine for the money.
3.0,"Cute , but cheaply made. Which is fine for what i paid . Cute for a summertime outing ! Runs a bit big . I’d size down one in my opinion. You want this type of dress form fitting !"
3.0,I got the product in a timely manner and the material is nice but the color is very different from what I ordered.
3.0,"Super cute and feminine without being too tight. Very thin and cheaply made. This jacket will not keep you warm. On the smaller side, so order up if you  are between. I may return as I do not think this jacket will stand the test of time."
3.0,This was an eh purchase.. I’m not big on crop tops to begin with but I liked the colors so I got it. This one came a lot brighter and not as vibrant as I thought it would be.
3.0,This is super small. I am a size 6 and wanted a baggy around the house Kimono and this is not it.  It fits more like a blouse rather than a robe or kimono.  XXL would work well if you are US size 2 or 4.  I also think it is a bit shorter than the picture.  I am 5'8 and it comes to my thighs.
3.0,I would give 5 stars but the straps are a little weak. I can’t pack my purse too much or the straps will come off
3.0,If you’re a short girl like me they are going to be like full pant leggings not Capri leggings.<br />I hope the high wasted pant doesn’t ride down.<br />I like these but the waist part rides down
3.0,Plastic all in the inside.  Already tarnished.  Will not stay clasped.
3.0,Looks better in the picture but they are super comfortable!
3.0,"not as roomy as expected,good quality though."
3.0,This was a super comfortable outfit for traveling. Unfortunately after the first time I washed it on the gentle cycle the seams came apart around the neck. I'm very disappointed in the quality and had expected it to last longer than one wash.
3.0,Not thrilled with the shirt as the material is cheap and somewhat scratchy.  The elastic arm bands are tight and uncomfortable as well as the color gray is very dingy and almost looks like a dirty white.
3.0,"I am using this on my dog's collar as it is easier to see where she is at night when in the yard.  First off it seemed to be very good.  Light is bright.  But the light tends to shine brighter on one side then the other where the button and battery are.  Not a big deal.  The back side cover can slip off to access the battery, but if you don't put it on correctly, the battery doesn't make good contact and the light will not be as bright.  My dog managed to break the clip I guess by scratching at her collar.  I found the light and a few days later found the spring clip.  Luckily it happened inside and not out.  I did manage to put the spring clip back on.  I how have to keep an eye on it to make sure she didn't knock it off again.  I give this 3 stars due to the cover not staying on correctly, and for the clip that broke.  I guess if you were to wear this on your jacket, you wouldn't have these problems."
3.0,The bead was really pretty when it was shiny and new but after a few weeks of costant wearing of my bracelet ith the bead on it the bead started to tarnish. After about 2 months I had to take the bead off because it didn't look nice anymore.
3.0,"Loved the dress and ordered per the instruction that it ran large.  Unfortunately, the dress didn't fit and there was no larger size to change it out to."
3.0,Runs big. Very thin material that wrinkles easily.
3.0,My grandson loved the shoes but one came defective. The customer service was excellent I returned the shoes and purchased the same shoes and they arrived super quick and are perfect. the shoes themselves are built good with rubber soles and a convenient location for charging and switching  light modes.
3.0,I would really love this bracelet if it was oval shaped so it can be closed a lot more and sit on the wrist properly.  Such a shame because it’s a beautiful bangle otherwise.
3.0,"Really pretty. Women’s style, But way to big for most women cyclist. No information about resizing smaller."
3.0,Love the cut and style but it's a little bit more &#34;fitted&#34; than expected.  I would recommend purchasing one size larger.
3.0,I want to like these sunglasses but the have a smear in the lens that will not come off. I have had them for a couple of months but rarely wear them because the smear is so annoying.
3.0,"I have small ears, so it worked without cutting them. But they were very uncomfortable after wearing them for around 2 hours.<br />And very hard to get back on after being a little drunk and sweaty."
3.0,So cute but crazy big !
3.0,"Small enough for a new born. But as I look at them now, they look like baby earrings."
3.0,"It is a little tight, I suggest for bigger guys to order a size bigger. I’m 6’2, 370 and a 3XL isn’t a real 3XL size. Definitely snug"
3.0,"Strange, my original review disappeared.  Well made, however just a tad too small. Was able to use some Goop to snug up.  The seller attempted to bribe me to delete the original review"
3.0,Sent back as they did not fully cover me lenses
3.0,Very pretty and flowy but its not burgundy nor a deep ..just red
3.0,Quality just fair
3.0,"The hat is O.K. but I wish it had a larger brim to keep the sun off my face.  Otherwise, it is a good buy."
3.0,Came in way too large. Very poofy on me. Needed to return. I'm 5'4 and 150lbs. I got a medium
3.0,"OK, its $22, so I didn't expect  much, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was described as having a stainless steel case; turns out its brass thats been chrome plated. The screw down case back appears to be aluminum, and while the front crystal is glass, the back crystal under close examination looks, sounds and feels like plastic.  The movement is automatic, but again, for $22 don't expect much.  I can clearly see that the jewel's have not been properly oiled (if at all), and their is debris under some of them.  Change out the band that it comes with, and you have a decent looking beater."
3.0,Thanks for the order. Im already using them.
3.0,"I should have ordered a size down. These run big and don't hae any shape.  Super cute neckline, but it buckles and doesn't lay flat. Soft, almost bathing suit material, yet soft material. I expected to wear this with leggings, but it is very long and seet through.  I'm size 16/18 and the XXL fit SUPER big and long. Still cute, but for sure a cover up more than dressy."
3.0,Adorable outfit and perfect for super hot days! But the flower fell apart after one wear.
3.0,"Plastic fastener doesn't inspire confidence that it will stay fastened, but the fabric is quality, as is the overall design.  I wish I could get a &#34;plus size&#34; option."
3.0,I can't figure out how to size the band.  The instructions don't show anything about it.
3.0,Cute little bear. Really heavy. Chain broke within minutes. But I bought for grand daughter to play with.
3.0,Loved this item at first! But they don't stay like in the picture and only after a month of having and barely wearing the eating stem broke as I was putting it in my ear so I can't wear it anymore:(
3.0,"The glasses case works; its functional but difficult to open. We purchased it, in part, for the hummingbird design, but the fabric was situated on the case so only one hummingbird is partially visible (cut off) on the back side."
3.0,"This did not fit as expected, so had to return it. It was super cute though."
3.0,A little short on a girl 5’9 but still looks cute. Ordered an XL and the length ends at the bottom of my calf but not quite at my ankles.
3.0,The hood is so big and weird on this and it's so thin that it's more like a shirt than a sweatshirt.
3.0,When I received the purse I absolutely loved it & tossed my old purse. 2 weeks later the main zipper broke - it's a 2-way zipper with pull tabs & doesn't close in either direction!!
3.0,I'm 5'10 and 215 pounds and the XL was loose on me so I'm returning.  The fabric was comfortable and soft and I hope to increase the rating after the smaller size arrives
3.0,"Looks better on the pocture. Mine also stunk really bad, I sprayed perfume to see if it goes away"
3.0,Would have liked the glasses to be a bit bigger
3.0,[[VIDEOID:92284f45191e62d7131a51ee6efa744a]] I really wanted this item to work. The fabric is soft and light and the idea of it is cute for summer. BUT this item is not well suited for individuals with a long torso. I felt like there was no extra material on top to give the look of hanging over the waist line like in the product pictures. And then it seemed to have the extra material below waist which made it look baggy.<br /><br />Based on the other comments I purchased a LARGE but maybe I should have gotten an XL. Not sure if that would have fixed the extra material in the wrong area.
3.0,"This one was a bit of a miss for me. I just didn't fit me well, the sleeves were too short and the length of the sweater itself wasn't long enough for me as well. I do like the style and look of this but I wish I would have sized up. Just did not work for me."
3.0,"I'm a woman's size 6 which is on the smaller scale for an American woman . Ordered a medium the bra seems to be a 32 A , I'm a 36 c . The skirt does not go but half way around so perhaps to the tailor I'm an xtra large ? Other than that it is beautiful and I may redo this costume and make it into something else . It runs super small but is pretty all the same ."
3.0,I like it.  Wear it all the time.
3.0,"It is a very pretty band BUT I have had it not even two months and today one of the elastic bands which holds the beads on broke :( beads everywhere. I do not have large wrists. I'm sad it is SO pretty. I'm torn do I reorder... was it a fluke, or take a chance on another company? Two months is just not very long when you don't wear it every day either."
3.0,"I liked the comfort of the dress, but not that flattering."
3.0,It's very pretty.  Was stunned by how small the shamrock is.  I had to look it over very carefully and finally put my glasses on to be able to see it.
3.0,"Good fit, pants a bit too rough"
3.0,Cute top and leggings but photo is misleading. I did NOT receive the headband as pictured.
3.0,Feel apart after 2 times wearing
3.0,Size was as expected but none of the pinks matched.
3.0,"Really nice, but the rings tones started falling off 2 weeks after I got it."
3.0,"I've worn it a few times and it pills up pretty badly.  I probably won't buy this or any other sweater from this label again.  That being said, when it was new, it looked great.  The quality just isn't there."
3.0,"I like the glasses but one pair was a little bent so they look slightly lopsided and one pair, the temple was too loose."
3.0,"Snug fit for a hefty US guy, especially in the upper arms, but fits better than other kurtas."
3.0,"It's a cute dress. The pattern is the same as the picture.  It has good stretch to it. The top on my dress, I think, fits perfect but because it needs to stretch a little, and I am not a busty woman (pretty average), it changes color (I'm not sure if it shows in the pic). It almost looks faded. There was a string on one of the seams hanging out. I bought it for cheap, 15.99, on prime day so I will keep it but I wouldn't spend any more than that on it."
3.0,"I didn't receive the cross body bag that is displayed. It was a &#34;my little pony&#34; cross body, but not the one I ordered. That's a little disappointing.  But my granddaughter seemed to like it.  It's small but she is only 5 years old and very petite so it works."
3.0,"These run very small and are very short in length. Bought these for my 16 year old son who usually wears a S/M, after reading other reviews, I ordered a L and they fit him perfectly. They are a very thin mesh fabric. He likes them and wears them for boxing."
3.0,These socks look great but are constructed poorly. After one wash the threads are coming lose and threads and starting to pop out. They are also pretty tight on my leg.
3.0,I have a long torso being 5' 8&#34; and it came up too short on the chest
3.0,I got a large . And it was loose from the chest and sleeves.<br />I should have gotten a size down
3.0,I read some of the reviews and I would agree that it seems to have a cheap feel to it. I still like mine.
3.0,Loved the color and feel but the top seemed a bit snug.
3.0,"Fit as expected, I read reviews that you should order a size up if you want a looser fit and I did that and it was loose and long enough to just wear with leggings. Quality is not good though. Lots of snags on it"
3.0,"It is a very sensitive fabric. Meaning it wrinkles easily. So I can imagine it would wrinkle a lot from sitting and standing at an event. I bought this to wear at a wedding and decided against it. The slip underneath is quite short and serves no real purpose if I bend over and had the wrong underwear. It is hard to get it to fall on me like the pictures. I'm curvy with a smaller chest and a large was better on me but would need a belt to look less dull. The green is more dull of a color as well, not as vibrant."
3.0,"Ring is very pretty however it runs small, i ordered up one size and it was still too small."
3.0,Don’t have a photo of me in the dress just yet. Love the material and the dress the major complain I have is the seam in the front and the polkadots don’t line up. Thankfully it’s comfortable wear backwards that the seam is less noticeable that way.
3.0,"Decent fabric, runs small.. order size up"
3.0,It was a graduation gift for my granddaughter. She just completed her cosmetology classes and setting up for business. Looks pretty good
3.0,I ordered this bathing suit for my annual FLA Keys trip. It was cute but the bottom fit very snug around the legs. I  not a big woman and ordered a large. The fit was ok except for the bottom. The holes also left me with tan lines that looked like the bathing suit. The suit is made very well and I like that the hunter tied.
3.0,"Almost a g-string in the back, had to return. Liked everything else"
3.0,Fabric is thin...runs small
3.0,Very cute colors but they are very thin and get dirty really easily
3.0,The quickhook is cheaply made and not what I was hoping for.
3.0,The set are easy to wear and perfect
3.0,The boots are cute but definitely on the cheaper side. When I received the box it felt like nothing was inside. It was so light! However I prefer lighter weighted boats compared to bulky heavy boots. These boots would be something you buy at an indoor swap meet. I mean I guess for the price it's ok. They are not the best but are doable.
3.0,"I liked this dress but its more like 100% polyester.  I have a bit of a belly and the dress displayed the indentations of my belly button.  Which was a little to clingy for me.  I expected a little more flow.  Can't size up because the boat neck and arms would be to large.  If you want to show off your figure, this is a perfect dress for you.  The yellow as described is the color in the picture, not really a yellow.  But pretty color.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 150 lbs. I ordered a small and the top fit perfect and the length hit just the top of my feet."
3.0,"I sent it back, to small and a little soiled"
3.0,I’m 5’4 210lb I ordered a XL they fit fine and are really cute only problem was that I ordered the red ones and got orange : ( I kept them because they was for a denim party and I need them today if they had been the right color I would have gave 5 stars
3.0,This shirt is cute. The colors are bright. The fit is a little awkward and boxy for me. I wore it once and had to tie it to make it fit better. Or you could ruck it in. The sleeves are a little big and awkward too. It's just too wide.
3.0,limited instructions for operation<br />you can tell the writer was not completely fluent in english<br />illustrations of operation limited<br />never was able to get the hourly chime to work using instructions and illustrations<br />otherwise it seems to be a nice watch<br />you might have better luck to get the hourly chime to work
3.0,it breaks easy
3.0,"Nice product, wrong size."
3.0,"Quality  vinyl. ...  No shoulder strap.<br /> Nice large size. Girlfriend will keep it. Cute print, she says."
3.0,"The front looked great, but the seam in the back was way too low"
3.0,"For the love of God, please put something on the ends so you can thread the laces!  These have absolutely no reinforcement on the ends leaving you with a limp noodle to force through the eyelets of the shoe.  It literally took me  30 minutes per shoe."
3.0,"Very quick delivery!<br />Cute necklace, no earrings in box. A bit disappointed but necklace looks exactly like picture and beautiful.!!<br />Will order again hopefully earrings will be with necklace"
3.0,Nice looking sunglasses but I didn't get the color I was expecting. I ordered light orange but got clear instead kind of disappointed
3.0,"The (L) fit is slightly smaller than expected, and the arm holes are too big. I'm sending it back. Shame-it's a cute shirt otherwise."
3.0,"This sweater is cute and feels really soft. However, it snagged really easily just taking it from the plastic zip bag.  I'm keeping it because I think I can ""fix"" the snags but thought I'd share how easily it gets caught."
3.0,"super weird - I guess I expected more coverage. I think if I had a rockin 20 year old bod and wanted something flashy, the construction and the pattern would be great. RUNS SMALL - I usually wear a 0 or 2 and I'm 5'6&#34;"
3.0,The material was nice and appears to be flattering. But I am a drag queen that doesn't wear padding. The chest was too tight and the waist was too big for my boy body. Really need an hourglass figure to fit into this dress.
3.0,These were purchased for my son to wear to a wedding.. Either the sizing is off or we got a dud pair.
3.0,Very very very short.....
3.0,Sweater was nice but ran small
3.0,"Very cute and warm, just a little disappointed with the hood. It doesn’t stay on my little one’s head. Always falls back because it isn’t constructed with enough fabric."
3.0,concrat's on saving the stockholders $.00000000000001 by making them just a little too small
3.0,I had two runs after only 3 wearings.
3.0,"Baggy fit; no fleece, but does block the wind a little."
3.0,"I read the sizing description and I still couldn't fit into this. It seemed like a nice breezy, easy, dress to wear for summer and I couldn't even get it to close. Very disappointing. The only person, I could think of that would fit into this was pregnant and couldn't even if she tried.<br /><br />It seems nice but I don't have time for things that don't fit."
3.0,"Though I looked at the sizing chart(which matched me perfectly) the bodysuit arrived too big, so definitely think of sizing down one or even two sizes! The headpiece is made very cheaply and flops around a lot, would recommend putting a wire in there. Tail is mainly wire, no stuffing. Had to make some adjustments, but as far as looking like Catra it’s a 10/10. Not worth the price in my opinion."
3.0,Very pretty but the shape of the top is odd with the middle front being shorter than the sides.
3.0,"I have ordered the mocha polka dot pants twice and both times have received navy polka dot. I wrote to the company letting them know the navy pants are mislabled and say they are mocha.  But when I ordered the second time, I got another pair of mislabeled navy polka dot pants.  I returned both and will not be making a third attempt.  It's too bad because I love the pants and own many different colors/patterns.  I specifically want the mocha ones now, but it seems impossible to get them, unfortunately!"
3.0,Wish I’d seen the snow flake zipper 😔 I’m changing it out and it will be great.
3.0,"Not for large bust, no matter the size, it squeezes up top and gaps on the sides. Could not even remotely make this dress work. tried 2 different sizes. Probably work perfect if you are a C cup or lower. Loved everything else about it."
3.0,Too much polyester in it...
3.0,"This is the third pair of sandals I have bought over the last 7-8 years because I wore them all summer. So I bought another pair, expecting the same result. The only thing I do not like about this version is that the fastening strap is difficult to adjust, with an extra piece of leather on them, whereas the previous models did not have this problem. I will keep them, however and hope the straps wear better as they get used."
3.0,The color is nice and pretty but the earloop is too loose.
3.0,shoebite:(
3.0,This was a cute skate dress. It was to small and we ordered according to measurements. It came with a rip in the sleeve. Delivery was longer than expected so it came as we were walking out to a competition.  Adorable dress but we did not wear it again
3.0,"Better than many other strapless bras I’ve had in terms of comfort, but I’m disappointed that the strap in the front does not really have any real function.  It provides little to no lift.  Just adds bulk, which I would tolerate if it served the function, but as is it’s just a negative feature.  I was really hoping this was the one.  Heavy sigh!"
3.0,"Well.... I love the dress. It arrived early. However, I wore it once and the zipper has already broke. For $25 that's not what I would have expected. I've bought dresses from Amazon for less than $10 that I have not had any problems with. The material is nice and not cheap. I also had a hole a couple inches below the zipper I had to repair. And that happened while I was wearing it the first time. I was not even doing anything active in it.  If you buy the dress, watch the seams."
3.0,"Shirt is super cute and comfy, BUT the criss cross is off center and is very noticeable when wearing it."
3.0,Pretty cute. Light weight. Can dress up or down.
3.0,"I was happy when I received this product, looked good and functional. However, after first use when my luggage arrived at my destination the shorter strap (without the lock) was busted. I was happy that the main lock strap didn't break. I would not use this again."
3.0,Doable but arms would be better if they were raglan sleeves.  Arm holes were a little tight but I pull the sleeves down and wear a sleevless dress with it.
3.0,"These are beautiful hoops, but the coating turns my earring hole green. I can only wear them for a few hours at a time before they start to turn green and start bugging me. Not real gold coating in any way, and equivalent to what you would find at low end department stores. Good for the price, just don't like how sensitive my ears become with them on."
3.0,Not that comfortable but okay to work in for 8 hours but no longer.
3.0,This shirt run's big. It's way cute though.
3.0,these run very very small and make your chest look square.
3.0,Needs to be returned to big around the waist
3.0,"I expected glitter, there was no glitter"
3.0,White shirt came with multiple big yellow stains. Very disappointing.
3.0,Very beautiful earrings.  Wore them too much and ended up breaking the bendable back rod of one so can't wear it any more.  Purchased back in January 2017.
3.0,"I bought these for my husband for his birthday.  I ordered a XXL thinking that they would be on the roomier side for him.  Unfortunately when they arrived the package said these were a boys XXL and they fit really small.  I was able to easily return these pants.  It's too bad because the pattern and quality was really nice, especially for the price."
3.0,look great but does wear out quickly
3.0,"This is a mid-weight, double layer, wool gaiter.  The stitching is solid.  It is warm.  Seems a bit short - the 3 other merino gaiters I own are substantially longer.<br /><br />But I buy wool as it is environmentally superior to man made fibers.  That is unless you package it in a gimmicky plastic, silver, zippered envelope that will be here long after I am dead, and generations after me.<br /><br />No thanks!  It’s a return and 3 stars for managing to make wool something environmentally hazardous."
3.0,"I am 5 ft., 162 lbs, 38DD bra, wear size 12. I ordered this thinking it was a dress but it isnt.  This is an open front kimono, therefore, I returned it. Otherwise, it was pretty, lightweight, kinda see thru. Looks like the picture except it opens in the front."
3.0,The material doesnt have much give<br />Good quality but the stripped one has zero elasticity  order a size up<br />I have an extremely thin grandaughter and we ordered 12-14 she weight 92# and they dont fit<br />Will be returning sadly the bands are too tight for her too
3.0,"The size ran smaller than expected.  I can still wear it, but it's a little snug."
3.0,The pants are nice. I like the fabric and the quality is good. But they run small. I'm a size 12 so I got the large. I can't zip them. They zip on the side.
3.0,"Nice cut, very flattering. However the top is only for very small chested women. I'm a B cup size and the buttons are tight especially after it shrunk a little after the first wash. Unfortunately too late for me to return."
3.0,It was obviously a returned item with absolutely no tags or washing instructions.  Still fit well and I liked it so I washed and kept it.
3.0,"Looks good, white is WHITE, but small hat"
3.0,Nice material but runs big.
3.0,This Jentyata women’s Bra they are well made. Material is good and stretchy. I wear a size 38 C bra and it’s very tight. I couldn’t even try it on. It will fit comfortably whose bust is around 27 to 30 inches.  Please check the size before you purchase it’s not a one size fit.
3.0,"Took forever for me to get this item. The shipping was awful. However, the shoe fits great and looks great."
3.0,The chain was very weak and broke the first time I put it on.
3.0,loved the material and style but unfortunately unless you’re a size 10 or under you won’t have a loose flowing fit. Arms are very tiny too. I returned it.
3.0,It's cute but kind of rides up. I got a large but I'd usually wear a medium and it does fit but if it shrunk even a touch I wouldn't be able to wear it anymore.
3.0,Because the band wont snap together (I tried everything) I gave it three stars. But its true white!
3.0,They are not as long as expected. You can not make a beanie out of them unless you have a childs head. you can not make a Balaclava. Not long enough. otherwise they are good for all else noted on package. Not sure how they will hold up to washing. I suggest hand wash and rinse. might shrink if dried in dryer.
3.0,We wanted silver but got rose gold...that packing pouch oddly says silver. Disappointing
3.0,Very cute but changed colors writhing 2 weeks of having them. Although I just didn’t take them off so. Probably do to over wearing.
3.0,"I wasn't very impressed with this top. I’m a 36C and 28 waist. According to their size chart I should have ordered an XL. No way! Every time I’ve followed the size charts for tops like this they’re always too big. So I ordered my usual size medium. It fits, but it’s not the most comfortable. It doesn’t feel tight, but the hem rolls up. The armholes are too high up the armpit. There is also no support. I had to wear a sports bra underneath. It would make for a cute casual top though. I’d recommend ordering a size up from your normal size."
3.0,"Pretty, but kept slipping ff...ribbons were not the best way to keep them on."
3.0,"Good product, however, my wife is allergic to them"
3.0,It was too small for my 4 year old nephew. Size wasn't mentioned on the description
3.0,I did not receive the bow tie that was supposed to come along with this outfit. That leaves me very disappointed. In my eyes the bow tie completed the look and now I'll have to go buy a bow tie that matches his outfit. No way to contact the seller.
3.0,Ordered this for my sister as a birthday present. Ot was too big for her and had rust stains on the collar. She said the material is great and she would have loved it. She isn't going to return it because that is how she is so I ordered her another one. Fingers crossed 🤞
3.0,Be aware that this is size S and is smaller than the average targets that you see and you are probably used to.
3.0,Frames arrived bent and unaligned.
3.0,"Just kinda baggy and frumpy, not that comfortable."
3.0,"Runs somewhat small and made with two (2) different, stretchy fabrics."
3.0,Comes apart at the wood after a while. I would recommend getting all resin not this style
3.0,"it ok, some colors I don't like"
3.0,"Please note: I bought in Nov 18’ but only wear this watch band every few weeks.<br />The Good<br />Love the feel and look of this watch band, a lot of compliments. The band is built very sturdy, stitching is strong and very appealing.<br /><br />The Bad<br />The band holder that slides onto the band, to keep it from hang off, is junk. It got a slight tear in it around the 1st week I bought the band, back in Nov ‘18. I’ve glued it numerous times but within a few weeks, it would be cracked again. I personally can’t wear a band without this piece, so essentially my band is no good anymore. I wish 2 or 3 of these band holder pieces, came with the band."
3.0,"Arrived with part of the threads pulled, which is annoying. I’ve tried three different times to get the right size band and finally got the right size band, but to have it defective right out of the package is irritating. I used a lighter and melted the hairs down.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent band. I think the defect I received is likely the exception not the rule.<br /><br />One this I noticed is the attachments aren’t as large as on most aftermarket bands. They kind of slide around in the channels on the watch face. That’s the reason for the lower star rating. For the price, it’s not bad though."
3.0,"I really love this dress for my daughter, but I would recommend getting a size smaller  . I got a size 12 month and it’s way to big."
3.0,"These shoes are okay. Not as comfortable as my older Brooks, and definitely not my favorite shoe ever. I think the heel to sole drop is good and the tread seems to be good quality, but the toe box is pretty narrow. I don't have a wide foot (nor wear any wide shoes), and my pinkie toe goes numb if I wear them too long (even with the laces looser). Arch support isn't the greatest, but not the worst either. I've had Brooks that I've loved, it's just not these ones. I wouldn't necessarily wear these for walking/hiking either - they're not ""long distance"" shoes, by any means. I use them for about an hour a day and that's all I can tolerate them.<br /><br />Overall mediocre pair of shoes. Just can't ever find a way to get comfortable in them - don't think I'll be buying this model of Brooks again."
3.0,Cute jacket did not fit. Ordered a large the first time and extra large the second time and still was too tight and couldnt zip it up.
3.0,Adorable shirt. It runs very small especially in the shoulders and chest area.
3.0,"I got a medium for length and it's still a little long. Normally I would wear a large due to my upper area and hips. But the medium is very loose and long. not as short as I had hoped. I am 5'6, long body short legs and it goes to my knees?"
3.0,"Quick deliver.  Size of bracelet small dissapointed,  really wanted a rose gold hand piece. Nice looking though may give a niece"
3.0,"There is no wire for the nose area, to keep it in place.<br />The straps don't stay on the ears, so I had to add strap adjustors.<br />Disappointed. But love the message and RBG!"
3.0,Too easily scratched.
3.0,Drawstring breaks after just a few uses. I’ve owned several pairs of these sweatpants. They are just standard sweat pants with a logo. Not real quality pants.
3.0,"These are like &#34;industrial-strength&#34; compression socks, kind of ugly, which I only wear for casual occasions.  I also don't like the &#34;Go2 Socks&#34; logo shown all over them!  The heel and foot do have good padding, however...  Overall, I like Sockwell brand better."
3.0,Bow headband doesn’t come tied. I have no clue how to do it. But the outfit is nice looking
3.0,I ordered my size by the chart. Asian inches are not the same as American.
3.0,"They tend to run a bit larger than expected. They look well, but a bit flimsy. Have to wash them carefully or else they'll break.<br /><br />Pay attention to your height."
3.0,I got 2 packs of 3 in each (I thought it was all 1 pack).  They are all the same colors. Not the same as the picture.
3.0,"The shoes fit fine but the sole is not grippy at all, very slippery on many surfaces maybe it will get better with time? They are advertised as great grip, not true! I have other gum soled shoes those have great grip!"
3.0,"Hard to wear with eye glasses.  Opened back.  However, embroider US Army patch is great."
3.0,"I wasn’t pleased with the color, although the quality was okay. I returned it."
3.0,The outfit is cute but it does run small. I expect my daughter will only get two...maybe three wears out of it. Also the pants fit like capris which was unexpected. It's cute but Im debating whether I want to retun it or not.
3.0,"The suit itself is great but definitely came in much smaller than I expected. I'm a 34C, 130LB, and orderd the large and it was probably 2 sizes to small. But other than that, the material, color, design was very cute and true to what's pictured."
3.0,"This is very cute and fit my daughter well. She is 27 months old but still fits into 18 month clothing (is now finally moving into 24 month). However, after two washes, the lining has already begun coming out. There is plastic string type stuff that is sewn into the dress but is now poking out of openings in the sewing. Unfortunately its too late to send it back so it's wasted money. I would not buy from this seller."
3.0,So they look close to what you see however they are all tossed in a bag and some had stones missing on arrival. I have however used a set for a week and I swim for 2 hours average every day and they look the same l. Just not sure where stones went since they arrived that way and the stones weren’t even in bag... all came screwed together since reviews said they don’t screw I left them together and just pop them in my ear that way. They are very shiny so at least not a flat full fake gem look.
3.0,The white dress fit perfect as a medium and the green ran a bit snug. I’m 5’2 135lbs. Aside from that the dress is exactly as advertised 👌🏽
3.0,"Sizing not quite right, doesn’t lay like the photos"
3.0,"Purchased for my daughter, but they don't stay on. They are slightly big, which wouldn't be a problem if you could adjust the ties to tie tighter, but they're elastic and you cannot adjust them. Hopefully they will fit better when her feet get a little bigger."
3.0,"Good bang for bucks. But quality is poor overall. I had to take out the front glass so that my watch would not grind against it while in use. The front latch is of poor quality plastic. Otherwise, it has worked out well."
3.0,This was much bigger and clunkier than I had expected. The chain is short for such a thick necklace as well.
3.0,"I like it, but in my opinion quality could be better. Some threads started to fall pretty fast and it started to electrify (not sure if that's the correct word, sorry english is not my native language). But I like overall design anyways."
3.0,The ring is not like a snow globe - it's a round ball with a tree and some powder. I expected a snow globe type appearance which could be shaken and the snow would drift down. This is just powder in a ball with a tree. Disappointing.
3.0,Bar is waaayyy long. The jewels are pretty but large and press into your ear could not sleep in it at all. Difficult to get in as you have to thread the bar through your ear then then jewel then your ear again. Quality is good for the price
3.0,a little to wide
3.0,"Shipping is a little long, the dress is super cute. You need do need to go up a size or two."
3.0,not as tight woven as I would like
3.0,"Although these are lovely, they take up to much room and take away from the other charms on my bracelet.  Ended up sending them back."
3.0,"So cute! Got them for me and my two besties for vday, came quick with prime. Didn’t come with the little wing which was disappointing because i thought that was the cutest touch."
3.0,"Super cute, love the fabric, color and style. Just sooooo tiny. I’m 5’8 139lbs, I received a size 6, looks like a size 2. Couldn’t even get the waist above my knees😬 size up for sure!<br />Otherwise they are totally cute!!"
3.0,Just hangs on your body. Bought it just to wear for shopping and lounging.
3.0,"Looks like it would be a nice swimsuit, but the sizing is so confusing. I had to return it since it was nowhere close to my size."
3.0,These work well. They have a larger eye cover than other goggles. My 13 yr olds seems to like this because they can see better with them on.
3.0,Material was soft. Color OK. It did not look flattering on me at all. Don’t like those little pocket flaps in the front.
3.0,The color was off it wasn't a true burgundy.
3.0,Super cute purse but about 3x larger than expected!
3.0,I like it. I wish it was cotton though.
3.0,"This shoe hurt my big toe, so if I really wanted to wear it, I put on band-aids."
3.0,"just to be clear these look nothing like diamonds. at all. they are however very pretty! look exactly like the picture except with the cubic zirconia being more transparent. the backs are bent a little,  but plenty usable. for $6 with shipping, definitely fair. they come in an envelope not a box<br />*they are WAY too big to be believable and frankly look like glass/crystal"
3.0,Came on time and looks really cool. But I can't wear it because it doesn't fit my ear nor can anyone I know where it cause they can't figure out how to put I on. I guess if you know the product it's fine. But it was pretty unclear about how I was actually going to be able to use it.
3.0,This clutch has a nice feel to it.. but it won't close when I put all my stuff in it. :/ Also there are a few of the little beads that are a different color gold then the rest. Very strange.
3.0,Can be cut easily for perfect fit. Very convenient but wears off quickly. Only got to use it for 3 months...
3.0,Shape is different.  First fit right
3.0,"Stiff, swede tangle at tongue, cheaply made, should have expected this being so cheap. Haven't wore yet although expect problems👎"
3.0,"Beautiful for a last minute prime -time dress :p Runs large, nice and lightweight for summer, and  the lace overlay is thin (my fingers caught on it)"
3.0,Had to return. The prescription wasn’t quite right for me. Looking straight ahead the progressive lenses were clear but unfortunately the slightest bit left or right wasn’t in focus.
3.0,Zippers dont close smoothly
3.0,a bit big for the size I ordered
3.0,Cheao but works
3.0,I ordered two sizes bigger than my sons current shoe and these are tight already. He will not get much use out of these
3.0,"Good, poor quality, one of the item damage"
3.0,"I'm a nurse and decided to purchase these after reading all the good reviews.  I love the bright colors but they are much thicker than I expected, also much tighter than I expected as well.  These would probably be great for runners but they are too thick to wear with my work clogs."
3.0,"I think these run a bit small. I should have ordered a size up. I think I ordered a medium and I am about 130 lbs. I do have a bit of a booty, though. ;-)"
3.0,gave as a gift.
3.0,Love the giant size for my round face and how light they are. Had to take off two stars because the arms became loose right away and the screws do nothing to tighten them. Now they constantly slip down my nose and fall off when I put them on top of my head.
3.0,This material is very thin but pretty
3.0,The arms are extremely long on this sweatshirt. It had to be worn with both shoulders out because of the way it was stitched on the rose red and the lettering was slightly off so love cant be read. I bought the black as well. It fit differently. I already laundered it so I can't return it.
3.0,This skirt has a curl to the end and is shorter in waistband. It isn't sewn as nicely as in the image on the seams. A Small was loose on my waist but it is a short garmet and only there for outfit accessory purposes.
3.0,Love the actual shoe! And the awesome design ... but just too tight on my toes ... leaves a line which I dont understand... because there is no line or shoe string or anything where the lines are on my feet.. it's over my toes ... and for the past 5 days ... my toes have started going numb .. half way through the day .... I would by again .. but it must specify of it is in wide or not ... that's the only down size. 2nd time buying shoes off of amazon ... and both pair have been too tight. But overall happy ... If only they wouldn't make my toes go numb. .. and throb. Good website to order from.
3.0,"I needed this for workout but the colour runs , which was very bad especially the pink one, it’s so bad that when working out and I sweat it stains the towel I lie on at the gym"
3.0,I love this dress and have not sent it back because &#34;I'm going to lose weight&#34; HA! It's very tight in the bust area (I'm a 42 D) but plenty room in waist. Very cute if I could wear it and ignore my breast being pressed down
3.0,The print is so dang small. Dissatisfied
3.0,"I love the color and sturdy comfortable material of this set.  I like to be able to freely move during my workout, and this material allows me that flexibility. It doesn't compress my pooch in the tummy area alot.  However, it fits true to size, and I'm overall pleased with it."
3.0,It doesnt go easily on cloth mask
3.0,The flesh tunnels are extremely flimsy and really difficult to get into your ear. The ones I got for size 2g were a little more firm but 0g you barely apply pressure and it folds. Not worth the hassle.
3.0,Good for a man. Just Ok.
3.0,I thought that the lens color was brown. its not it amber. gave them to a stranger
3.0,"I could not wear them, they were too large, looked funny on my feet."
3.0,Fits well but did not even last the whole season. The stitching started to pull and does not look good. They did last about 8 weeks being in the pool three times a week.
3.0,"I wear an 8.5 and these are too small, won't sty on my feet."
3.0,These glasses are not super dark at all. Cheap frame but for the price you can't beat it unless you're planning on doing some extreme boating or sport of some kind and you would not want to buy this glasses
3.0,"The top was much smaller than anticipated, even after measuring and ordering to their size chart. The fabric seemed cheap and the skirt was a different color from the body.<br /><br />The shorts were comfy and long enough for chub rub and bum coverage, but not visible to others when standing. The gathers on the stomach were flattering and the straps seemed sturdy."
3.0,Quality was kinda crappy but they fit and they are cute. I would order another.
3.0,I received two of the same when I should have had 6 different bows. Anyway I can get the correct one sent to me!
3.0,"Nice product, but the size was not accurate. I ordered large because I wanted it to last a while. But it hardly fit and my kid its average size."
3.0,Product look fine. Quality fine . Shipping took more than expected .
3.0,"It might work better for someone with larger breasts,  but it did not work for me.  It is not very flexible so the drooping neckline effect I was trying to achieve did not work at all.  It was awkward and bunched up more that drooped.  I wear a small B Cup and it did not sit well on my chest.  It is see through also."
3.0,Way smaller than the description says. Couldn’t even get them over my thighs!
3.0,"I have a size 7 5/8 head and although the circumference of the hat fits around my head I look like a bell-hop, not very complimentary. Gave it away!"
3.0,"Looked authentic (based on what Hopper wore in the show), and served its purpose as a costume.<br /><br />Don’t buy this as a day to day shirt, however. Like most Halloween costume pieces, it’s made with emphasis of mass production at an affordable price. The quality (thickness of material, stitching of buttons, etc) is simply not there for day to day wear. You’ll likely be disappointed if that is why you are considering buying.<br /><br />But again, if you are buying for what it is intended to be, an occasional costume piece, it does the job. For that purpose, it doesn’t disappoint, but neither does it impress, thus the 3 of 5 star rating."
3.0,"Product feels a little cheap, but they are only $10 sunglasses! Can't really expect all that much"
3.0,I material is soft and would be comfortable if it fit me.  I ordered the large which was the largest size they offered but it is tight.  Im Not a big dude and usually wear a small/med.  The large in this is more like an etra small.  I wish it fir cool lookin shirt.
3.0,These fit well and feel great but be prepared to sew holes closed in the crotch after wearing them about a dozen times.
3.0,Like-size<br />Dislike-no shine to them
3.0,"The description says it is &#34;Pendant Size: 3.3 x 4.5 cm 18'' Sterling Silver Chain&#34; In reality it is only about 19mm That is about 1.9 cm. It is very small. I was looking for something about an inch in size, this is extremely small based on the dimensions given.  However, that being said the silver work is very nice and the chain is beautiful and delicate, it feels like silk between your fingers. I would really like this pendant in the size it was advertised in though."
3.0,"The chain broke within 3 weeks, luckily we found the medallion on the ground in the parking lot"
3.0,I wear a 40D. Hope it fits. But it looks just like the picture. Didn't fit cup size is incorrect. Runs small
3.0,"I wear a medium in Simply Southern so wrongly assumed I wear the same size in this shirt. I'm returning it for an x-large, I'd rather it be too big than too small."
3.0,"These are nicely made gloves, but I have small hands.  I ordered size small, and they are too long in the fingers, way too long."
3.0,I ordered a large it’s more like XS
3.0,Cute but  you need to go up several sizes for a good fit.  I normally wear a regular XL and the 3X is tight.
3.0,"Always remember, you get what you pay for. Super cute dress, I bought for our engagement photos, but this is completely see through, in white not flattering for my body type (mom pouch super noticeable), maybe a different color would have worked better, but I’m returning the dress in white."
3.0,They are sheer and breathable. They don't fog up my glasses but are too heavy and don't stay up. They keep falling down. An adjustable strap would make them better
3.0,We ordered these for a gift and they won't fit a mans western boot. I am hoping we can stretch them  and make them work.
3.0,Like it but I cannot open to this date.<br />Need a video showing how to open or else I have to return it.
3.0,"These are really cute but they're very cheap. They come in a soft case and a tagboard box, and both were crushed in the mail, so the sunglasses I received were squished in places. I tried to bend them back but the nose pieces are so thin I was worried I'd snap them. So they're still uneven.  They're for smaller/narrower faces, and the lenses are a little taller than I like. But for a smaller person they'd be really cute if you got a pair that wasn't crushed."
3.0,"This poncho is lovely, but I have 2 misgivings:<br />1. I am 5'9, 200 lbs and was hoping this would be a poncho with some heft that would cover my elbows and most of my forearms. It only covers up to my elbows (I own other ponchos that give the coverage I described, but they are not turtlenecks so I was putting a lot of hope in this one.)<br />2. This poncho has a bit of an open weave/knit that is difficult to discern in the photograph. Again, a bit disappointing.<br />Having said, if you live where winter temperatures are mild, are only looking for an accent piece or a cover up in a cool movie theater, you will likely not be disappointed. In my situation this turned out not to be what I hoped for, but I can use it as an accent piece, so its not a total wash out."
3.0,"I was a returning customer to yogipace, buying this particular pant first time. Their fabric and durability is fantastic, but I can't deal with the 1/2in white logo flag tag sticking out at the left pocket!<br />I'm disappointed in yogipace for listing pics that purposely conceal the external tag sticking out from the seam. They use either a phone or a hand in the pocket to block view of the tag.<br />If I pull the tag off it will rip the seam, if I cut it will leave white remnant where the tag is secured by a serger seam, and I risk cutting the fabric.<br />Have to return these. FWIW the fit and feel are great, I would have enjoyed these pants."
3.0,Cute ring that you can adjust to fit. After a few months of wearing started rusting so I tossed it. Fine if you're looking for a temporary thing.
3.0,"I was so excited about this jumpsuit, because another jumpsuit I bought from this brand fit me so great. Now, I am a 4' 11"" girl, so fitting into rompers and jumpsuits is extremely difficult for me. I ordered this and the other jumpsuit at the same time... of course since the other jumpsuit fit great, I thought that this one would too. MAJOR FLOP. The top was fitting, but the length was too long so it looked really weird. Even the pant legs were too long. All around, it looked absolutely horrible on me, sadly. :( I ended up returning it."
3.0,Nice jewelry but too big to use as a nose stud...unless you have a huge hole in your nose!
3.0,"Pros: 100% cotton, soft, bold color, stays in place.<br />Con: Width is too thick for a toddler, in my opinion."
3.0,Flimsy shades. Were not identical. Only $5 so should no complaints
3.0,"Cons Dislike how they fir. Waist of pants meets my bra crotch is large. Pros really warm will wear these around the house outside  only ,because they’re warm . Would not purchase again"
3.0,"Strange material. A knit, but sort of slick. Print is ok but could be positioned for better body image."
3.0,eh? It was 4th of July and I wanted to be festive. I'll prolly never wear them again till next year if I still have them.
3.0,The bottoms fit we but the top is weird
3.0,"The product wasn't horrible at all. If you're trying to wear this more as a shirt then a dress, don't. It defiantly fits like a dress. I like the t-shirt look better, so that's why I returned this product. Other than that, the shirt is cute and looks exactly like the picture."
3.0,It needs to be longer!  I can wear it but I'd like it a lot better if the strings were longer...or the belt itself were a few inches longer
3.0,This dress fit much smaller than expected.
3.0,disapointed
3.0,Comfy dress. Wrinkles immediately after putting on
3.0,Thin itchy material
3.0,Not very comfortable and there is a plastic piece on the strap that keeps poking me.
3.0,Eh... there are better options to buy from.
3.0,"It’s ok. A bit itchy, the design is low on the shirt, so it makes your bust and stomach look like it has a face haha.. but I will keep it. Cute enough for the price!!"
3.0,"Bought this for my husband who is a mail carrier, glasses still fog up with mask on."
3.0,Too big. I sent them back. The reason I gave them 3 stars was because the return was so easy.
3.0,I purchased this piece in a 4T for my 3 year old. The pictures were so cute and I wanted her to wear this on her birthday. When it did arrive the material is super thin and the straps are a bit too large. I had to pin it up to keep her chest from showing. My daughter is 3 years old and very active. She wore the jumpsuit one time and after taking it off I noticed the crouch area completely torn. I tried to fix by sewing it but the material is so thin it would not hold a stitch.<br /><br />I love the look of the jumpsuit with the head piece and always get a lot of complements when my daughter wears it but you have to be careful with the material. I fixed the croch area with patches and thread. So far it is holding up.
3.0,Love it the only thing the band little small
3.0,"Pretty good, it has stretched out"
3.0,Watch band is too small.
3.0,Says it is pink but it is yellow peach not pink!!!!
3.0,Cute but leaf is very big
3.0,"Listen.. I'm 5'3 1/2... and this sucker wouldn't even cover the bottom of my butt cheeks lol! I'm US 16/18;1/2x (ordered this in 2x) depending on fit.. apple shape hybrid.. if you need this to stay down at a certain spot and you're plus size.. this might not be the skirt for you, unless you want the world and Jesus to see your bottom bits. Having said that though, if you want to try it, it's excellent quality, especially for the price."
3.0,Made my ears flake
3.0,"It is a cute costume but the size is way off, I have a 4 year old boy and I got the 4-6 and the shirt wont even go over his head it is so small.  I need to return and get a bigger size..."
3.0,Very dull but pretty.
3.0,nice but way too small
3.0,"These are ok. The sizing is definitely way off, but once you find the right size, they look cute."
3.0,The ball comes out pretty easily. The ring could be a little tighter.
3.0,Loved wearing as a dress to work but then I washed and dried it and now it’s a cute babydoll top
3.0,It fits well but is a tad long and the skirt floats up when you are in the water. Good bra support.
3.0,"I buy for me but don't fit well, but my niece love it."
3.0,"The bottoms fit perfect, but the top was a little small. I felt uncomfortable wearing it in public and would not buy again. The bathing suit is well made and the shells look just like the picture. The size issue was the only problem for me."
3.0,Nice earrings and recieved on time. Happy with this purchase.
3.0,"So, I ordered a XL when I usually fit an L, and it was was wayyy too small. The quality is great, but it's hard to fit. I had to return that one and order a 3X to finally got. Please pay attention to the sizes and take time to measure yourself, otherwise you might have to return it a few times. But otherwise, the quality is good and super quick."
3.0,It is a little close fitted for a size 14.
3.0,Need to be heavier chested to fit right. returned
3.0,Very Nice but Very Small! 3XL is a Large!!
3.0,"Purchased for my 3 & 4 y.o. they work OK, but do tend to slide down a bit. The masks with the ear straps tend to work better. There’s a pocket inside that fits a small filter."
3.0,If they weren't comfortable I would have given them 1 star... the strap in one is bigger than the other one. However I have it a chance since it's so light and comfortable.
3.0,runs small it's okay a little over priced but ok
3.0,"The material of the shirt is nice, and the fit was as expected but on big problem is the color of the shirt is way off!!!! I wanted the nice mellow yellow colored sunflower but instead I got a really bright orange sun flower shirt . I guess for a third of the price ,u get what u get 😕"
3.0,Slight shrinkage.  Comfortable.
3.0,I loved them when i bought them.<br />When they arrived i knew as soon as i saw them they run big. and had to return<br />Other than that looks just like the picture.<br />Beautiful shoe
3.0,"OK, so maybe a 3 is a low review, but I bought a man's wallet assuming that it would fit in a back pocket. It's WAY too big for that. It's also so stiff to open that it's hard to lay the money inside, I actually fold it and put it in vertically on one side.<br />The upside is that it is very durable, the studs are totally fabulous, very stylish. It would be GREAT as a small purse with a long shoulderstrap, maybe that would be a better way to market it. No way to wear this in a pocket!"
3.0,I don't like this hat.
3.0,The top is cute & the fit is ok but I would've preferred if it just a tad bit longer & just a little looser. This would've been reminded if a 3X were available. Over all I wore it with a longer sweater over it & it worked well though I wanted something I could wear solo with leggings. For reference I am 5'6 260 with alot of booty so I prefer EVERYTHING to at least cover my rear this does but kinda snuggly which I'd rather it were looser.
3.0,"These are handy and a value for the money. They are heavier than I had anticipated,  so I didn't give them to the kids, but have been using them"
3.0,The advertised photo looks stitched on and the hat I received is clearly printed. The at besides the picture looks to be nicer quality but I’m disappointed the dinosaur isn’t stitched
3.0,"Not a bad costume but obviously cheap material duh. The disappointment was the headband, it snapped in half while daughter was wearing it without her even touching it. Very sad 2 year old but get what you pay for."
3.0,Wish there was better sizing options
3.0,"Nice sock but not a ""men's"" sock. Will give to my 8 year old nephew."
3.0,"Love the style. Fit nicely through bust and shoulders. Boxy through the waist, not fitted; and shorter than i like. Does not cover my Shirley Temple knees the way i prefer. Linen is transparent when back lit. Wear a slip!"
3.0,Pretty earrings but too awkward to put on and keep straight.  They also looked larger in the website photo (on the model) so I assume you used a really small model.  I returned them.
3.0,"Now I have to return the product.  But I do like them, so if you order this product, make sure you ordered an 8 if you are 6, and so on."
3.0,Didn’t really like it
3.0,This style dress looks best on very thin people in my opinion.  I did not like the waist elastic.
3.0,"Title basically sums it up. These look more like girl pants in person. I could see them being cute on a girl but definitely not a guy. I got my son's normal size and he's used to wearing skinny jeans and he's a skinny guy but these pants looked ridiculous like he was wearing girls leggings. I had to hold back a laugh when he tried them on. Like I said though, I do think they would look cute on a girl as long as she's not stick skinny cause it definitely makes skinny legs stand out even more and the crotch is very tight."
3.0,"Fits great. I love the feel. They are definitely buttery soft. However, these started to pill very bad during my first wear. I didn’t wash before hand either. Very disappointing because it showed bad even in black. Oddly, it pilled the most on the shin areas. Also they seem to magnify cellulite divots."
3.0,"If these had fit, I'm sure this would be a 4 or 5 star review. The red is a brilliant color. The fabric is a nice medium weight and appears to be of good quality. However, these run VERY small. I'm 5' 3&#34;, 165 lbs, and wear a pretty consistent size 14 in dress pants. I would need a (nonexistent) size 18 in these."
3.0,Much larger than expected.  If you like bigger blingy earrings these are for you. I personally would have preferred a smaller version of this.
3.0,"I really loved the color and material, but this isn't a bag it's the size of my wallet, doesn't even fit my phone.<br />Returning it as it's not worth the price at all"
3.0,"The shirt right out of the package had an interesting smell to it, but it was very comfortable and fitted ok. I got the smallest size available and not only the shirt but also the sleeves were quite long on me."
3.0,"It's very comfortable and made of a smooth, soft material. It even fits me well.<br />**I paid for this product using my own money without any compensation or discount from the seller**"
3.0,Large and clunky...
3.0,"I like my lenses dark.  These are average. Tho difficult to manage at first, I like the way they clip on."
3.0,"Ordered a size XL for my husband.  The shirt is tight across his shoulders.  It is also a western shirt with deep curved yokes on the front and back.  It also has mother of pearl snaps, no buttons."
3.0,Got this for my wife's birthday. The sizing was wrong.
3.0,"Just OK. Chain tangles far too much,"
3.0,"Pretty color, nice material but didn't stay close"
3.0,Ok they were really nice when we started using them and loved the 3 different modes. The added bonus of being rechargeable was what originally sold us. Now after some time using them the first thing that went bad was the rubber flap protecting the charging port. It wouldn’t stay in place and ultimately fell off. The second issue was that the connector in the charging port got all kinds of debris in it and trying to loosen it caused damage to the connector. With a lot of patients I was able to get it to work 1 more time before it would not charge any more. The second light faired a little better after I secured the charging port with a piece of duct tape . This helped but the flap fell off anyway with use. And this time rain got in the light and it refused to charge. Bottom line they may be nice for a sedentary dog but not for a hyperactive dog that loves to dig romp in all kinds of weather and just plays hard.
3.0,"I was unhappy because when i received the 1st order 1 earring could not be used and a jeweler explained that it was crushed on one side, so it could not be opened..after complaining and said i would return the earrings, i did get a replacement pair...only to find that one of those earrings were damaged in the same way...so I now DO have a pair and I returned both damaged earrings, I am not completely happy with the quality of the earrings..thank you"
3.0,Easy to get dirty and scratch up...
3.0,"Good size, poor quality in the strap. Clasps are very easily breakable."
3.0,I really like the shirt but it does run pretty big.
3.0,They are good boots but the islets broke on the second day
3.0,I like the outfit but the color is not what the picture show you
3.0,"These glasses are probably best for someone who has a smaller nose, as the prongs don't widen enough for a larger nose. This means that if you have a larger nose, they will sit higher up.<br />The polarized lenses work, but they have a sort of ombre shading. They are darker near the top and they lighten up on the lower part of the lense.<br />Overall, they aren't dark enough for someone who wants strong shades. If you like sunglasses that let more light in, these are for you."
3.0,"This works ok but it doesn't fit exactly.  The band was made with a squarish shape at the watch, which sticks out a bit and makes it somewhat inflexible."
3.0,One Stopped working the second day of wear.
3.0,"I like it very much. It is a little small but it is Ok for petite people. But OMG, what is it that smell? It smells so strong and so weird like some kind of chemical that when stored in the closet, the whole room was stinky as well!! We need it to leave in the garage. My major concern is it toxic. And I can't wear it so far because I am going to stink as well."
3.0,This is pretty BUT.......it is no way gold looking like this picture.....very misleading.
3.0,"Dress fits great, but the strip across my backside is totally see through and I cannot wear the dress. I would order a different color in the future."
3.0,"I'm 5'6"" and the dress hit just below mid-calf which isn't flattering for most women. It's only for the price but I'm not in love with it."
3.0,"You need another pAir of leggings under these or you'll be exposed lol but they're super cute, pair with a crop top or baggy sweater :)"
3.0,It was ok for the price
3.0,Quality not what expected
3.0,These are super cute but also tiny.
3.0,"Gave to my daughter, wrong size sent for me.  Looked like a really nice shirt, but I hate sending things back."
3.0,"The colors are vibrant and look like the photo. I am keeping the shirt, but will likely only wear once or twice for patriotic holidays. The material feels similar to that of a cheap halloween costume. I don't think it will wear well."
3.0,"Nice dress, but too short"
3.0,"I can't give this product a better review because I chose based on colour and size, size was right but colours were so off,I realized that all the colours that said RED we actually pink, including this one."
3.0,"It was a very nice purse, but the zipper didnt allow me to open all the way, like I hoped for."
3.0,Came with dead battery. So much for an anniversary gift.... watch itself is nice.
3.0,Made well enough but recipient thought it too heavy to wear. Returned for credit.
3.0,Sleeves were to short. It was more A-line than I expected. Did not like the way it fit.
3.0,I like the earrings but it will start hurting when you wear it for long period.
3.0,"It's good enough for the price, I suppose, but not what I was hoping for. The material is a lightweight knit but not as stretchy as one might expect. There were a LOT of loose threads on the various seams when it first arrived, which is generally an indication of poor workmanship. If you're on the fence about buying this, I'd suggest you opt for ""no."""
3.0,"I typically can wear any A-line dress I purchase, it's a standard dress type in my closet. The material of this dress is odd (starchy?) and overall it fit me very strangely. The sleeves were too long and the bust was too large, but the waist was too small. I am 5' and typically wear a 12-14 depending on the bust size (38DDD). I had to return because the fit was so wrong for my body."
3.0,"I didn't really like this dress- the pattern is beautiful and the cut is actually fine, it's just so thin. There isn't any material underneath the one very thin layer, and the dress itself is very short. The sleeves were fine maneuverability wise- I had no issues with that, but I'm returning this dress because the quality is just really poor."
3.0,I ordered as a gift according to the size chart but clearly it wasn’t accurate. This shirt runs small.
3.0,stones are so tiny you almost dont see them. other wise they are nice
3.0,So I bought the itachi one and the front is like blue and that isn’t how it is shown. Kinda disappointed.
3.0,"Please size up, nice dress no stretch but tighter than expected. Must return"
3.0,Band will fall off if the outer tab is hit or pulled slightly. Cool look though.  Workmanship looks great but weak magnets<br />Also they offered a free band for a review but when you try and claim your prize the email they give is incorrect.  Just saying
3.0,"Super cute use them at work all the time!<br />These are the second pair I have owned. The first pair was not functional at all! I was disappointed with the quality of the first pair. So I was on the hesitant side for purchasing another tokidoki pair, however I decided to give  them one last try since they would be obvious to locate at work if they ever went &#34;missing&#34; or pocketed by accident. The mozzarella pair have been working well since I received them (several months now)."
3.0,"These look to be made from buttons which is fine, but the post was put in the middle of the monkey instead of behind his head.  They didn't hang right on my ears so I had to take the posts off and glue them behind the head.  Much better."
3.0,"These leggings are totally see through. Absolutely cannot wear them in public without something long enough to cover your bum. The material is soft, they fit nicely, they're comfy and great under a pair of jeans in the cold months but barely thicker than a pair of tights."
3.0,oversized and very think - not breathable
3.0,Order up a size this runs small.
3.0,"Great fabric and gorgeous fit, just super bummed that this jumpsuit is way too long. I'm 5'5&#34; and will need to have it altered at least 3 inches, if not more. What a disappointment to get a fabulously fitting outfit only to not be able to wear it! Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive because it doesn't come with the cute belt."
3.0,"A perfectly fine sock, but because my father has severe swelling in his legs, the large size was too small. Returned it for the XL size and they worked great"
3.0,"One underwire came out while wearing it the first day. It was poking me and I had to have my Fiancé pull it completely out while on the boat. Then after washing it just one time, the other wire was poking out so I had to pull it out."
3.0,"Does the job. It's cute but can tell it's made cheaply. Doesn't rip or anything, great belt but just material feels poor."
3.0,"Good quality material, doesn't feel cheap. That being said the top and the bottom don't seem to be the same size, or maybe other kids have bigger booty's wherever these are made. The bottoms are MUCH bigger than the tops."
3.0,"This is a cheap felt scarf, like the knock-off ones you buy from sidewalk vendors.  I like the colors and pattern but it will shed on you like crazy so don't plan to wear with a white shirt, dark suit or pretty much anything nice.  Also its on the short side.<br /><br />Not a bad product, just know what you're signing up for."
3.0,"For me - the top is too revealing. Otherwise, good quality - lined. Really pretty. Material is stretchy but not in a bad way."
3.0,"These were comfortable and kept me ""safe"" during light days.  On the second and third days (heavier days) I leaked through to my pants; totally defeating the purpose of these.  I would wear these as a supplement to pads or tampons and THEN I would have more confidence than on days when I don't have period underwear.  I can't trust these as my only line of protection.<br />They are comfortable and stretch well with my body. I do not feel as if I had any strange or overly-visible panty lines when wearing these."
3.0,"It was very well made, stitching was straight no loose threads.  The cut was exactly as shown in the picture.  However the suit was very small. I ordered a size XXL and I normally  wear a 16/18 with a 40c bra, I couldn't begin to put this on.  But it dose fit my daughter like it was made for her she wears a 7/8 misses and a 34 bra. If I could get this in my size I would definitely order another one."
3.0,it was large
3.0,"I just got this today. It's wrapped really well. I'm so used to wearing real leather, I can't get my head wrapped around this fake leather. I have a handmade crisscrossed bag that still looks great 15 years later.<br />This bag has gold hooks which turns me off and the stitching looks like it is straight from the assembly line. I like the green color, but it's just too much for me. Going to spend some extra $$ and get a real leather tote. Will return."
3.0,It function as advertised but it created a noise every time you hit any bump in the road.
3.0,"The pants are very nice. However I usually wear an xl , these was a 1x and was to small."
3.0,I guess people in China have much smaller busts than in America. I will have to loose a lot of weight before I can wear this.It will probably be a good will donation.But the price was too small to return.
3.0,"It’s beautiful, but the gold starts to change colors to that rusty gold color after a few uses as well as a strong rust smell."
3.0,"It is nice, but fits small"
3.0,Gifted it to a friend since the item was slightly to tight for me! She loves it!
3.0,Would be higher but my wife already bought a pair
3.0,I was disappointed in the small size. I think my baby will outgrow it in a month but it is cute.
3.0,This band is a little tight at the watch mounts. There is a little plastic in the pin sleeves that needs to be trimmed. It can cause the pins to not thread into the mounts. Good material.
3.0,On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a six. It fits well but it seems like I am tightening it frequently.
3.0,"Although it's a beautiful color and cut, it's BIG.  Which makes it look obviously fake to me. I'm sending it back."
3.0,"I gave these pants 3 stars because they arrived in poor condition. The seam of the zipper is not completely closed/sewn. While they are very comfortable on me (I’m 5’6, size 16, pear-shaped body), the actual product quality in way of finishing needs attention."
3.0,Appeared different in photo.
3.0,"Thin. Designed for more fit women. If you want to buy shorts to keep your fat in while you work out....these are not them. The size I put is my daughter's not mine. My daughter,17, likes them pretty good.😁"
3.0,It’s really cute ....However if made larger would looks its best
3.0,"The reason why I rated 3 star is because I like the style,it is fashionable.I really like in sunglasses where I can easily transfer it from eyes to my head.This one is great on that purpose.Those metallic frames, I always have a problem with those because my hair will get caught on the nose thingy. What I don't like about this sunglasses is the polarization is not that good.I don't like using it when I'm driving because of the glare. I always wound up using my husband's sunglasses from Daway."
3.0,Was only three mask holders one was a necklace.
3.0,its okay..
3.0,"Good eye protection but they do not form any kind of seal around your face, so the filters don't really matter."
3.0,It runs a little small and the style is just not for me. Has a bit of an old fashioned look to it.
3.0,Unfortunately this dress was too small on me. I ordered the 10 and wish it came in one size up! I couldn't zip the back all the way up. Would be perfect otherwise!
3.0,The top is way smaller than pictured. Personally way too much side boob for my tastes.
3.0,The earrings were too large for me.
3.0,"For the price its a great dress, but I ordered the Med - which actually says small and its very stretchy. I am 5`4 - 145lbs - 34c and somewhat plump in the booty area. I probably will not end up wearing it since it doesn't attenuate my tiny waist that I've worked so hard for.."
3.0,Like the shirt but is so thin.
3.0,"I really loved this dress in picture.  It is super cute!! Fabric wasn't quite what I was expecting, and when I tried it on it was kind of see through I would highly recommend a slip of some kind.  I'm an 8 us and ordered a M maybe I should have gotten the large not sure but it did fit and I think I will keep this dress as I really like the pattern just not a huge fan of  see through ness lol."
3.0,"I have had this on my watch for about a year now. Love the look and more formal aspect of watch band, however the black is wearing off onto my skin and silver is starting to show through a bit after wearing it almost everyday for a year. I don't get it Wet however it does get some water exposure between dishes and Natural splashing. Would purchase again though because I love the look."
3.0,"Nice boot, but calf area was too big (and I have good size calves)!"
3.0,"I guess you get what you pay for, and this was on special for under $2, but I only wore it once, and lost the cute little bird - as did my sister when she wore hers.  Other than that, it is cute!"
3.0,I was disjointed in the quality other than that they are fine
3.0,"Bought for a football game outfit and it did the trick. Nice loose dress to wear with leggings and puffy vest. The pockets are sort of a joke aside from maybe holding a card or some cash...anything heavy will make the whole side sag. No weird smells, nice and soft, doesn’t shrink after washing.<br /><br />But after maybe three or four times in the wash, it started to pill so now I use it for pajamas."
3.0,Is for a party so have to keep it but disappointed that it is a larger pattern just like the previous reviews picture
3.0,"Pretty, right size, but stiffer than expected."
3.0,"Braclett is nice enough.. The colors are nice and it looks great when you wear it... When you look up close it looks a little cheapo, but that's to be expected bc of the price... Over all, i really do like it."
3.0,"Material wise, the item was very good, soft and comfortable.  But using their size chart, the items was way too big and loose.  I probably could have gone 1-2 sizes smaller."
3.0,I bought a 4X and it for like a Large.  I had to give it to my daughter.  Very disappointed in the fit because the material was very soft an the padded bra was nice and thick.
3.0,"It was so pretty, but it unfortunately didn’t fit well. I think it is more suited for a thin build, not an athletic/mildly curvy build. Too tight in bust for me."
3.0,The product is very well made and the colors are true. My only issue is they're  thicker than most. I could not use them with the watch I bought them for. They do fit on my Sieko dive watch.
3.0,It did not stretch.
3.0,"This is a cute set, the fabric is definitely a synthetic.  You can feel the slickness, and see it as well.  Definitely don’t want to wear this on hot days since it will not breathe.<br /><br />The colors are pretty, muted and done well.  The size was surprising.  I got a S and the pants fit lengthwise to the ankle, and the top was long enough (sleeves).  The only issue I had was the way the style/sewing was done.<br /><br />Because this is synthetic, when the fabric is cut there is no threat of unraveling.  So you have a lot of raw edges that are visible.  So the pieces that are sewn together are basically one on top of the other, so the piece on top has its raw cut edge on the outside of the garment.<br /><br />First I thought this was a mistake, and than realized all the seams were like that.  It bothers me, makes it look sloppy/cheap.  But than again you’re getting a set for ~ $30 so it saves time to sew the pieces in this matter.<br /><br />If you don’t care about it (makes it look very relaxed) and just want a cute set to wear around the house/outside that’s comfy and easy to wash/wear than this is for you.  Just be aware that there are some sewing quirks."
3.0,"I've got to say, this has been a disappointing experience. I really want this to work. I'm measuring in as 28E and followed the size chart. I've tried the Christina in D (way too big, WAY too padded) and the Angelina in B (still padded, but livable, but too small), and both have been horribly wrong. I feel like I could do the Angelina in D and just assume that the Christina runs really big because of all that extra padding. But I don't know if I want to go through the order-try-return cycle again. I don't really understand the point of having a size chart if it doesn't fit your size.<br />I also tried the halter bralette. The bralette front (in large) is much wider than the cup front piece. So the small back is ok for my 28-30 band with the bra cups, but not tight enough with the bralette cups. It makes no sense.<br /><br />Update: tried the Angelina in size 4 (maybe old size C???) And it's too large. This is really frustrating.<br /><br />Update (hopefully last one): I got both the Angelina and the Rosanna in a size 3. Angelina volume mostly fits, but the shape is just not right for me. It's too closed on top. The Rosanna is wireless and is actually pretty decent fit wise. I'm not crazy about the push-up padding on the bottoms but I'm pretty sick of dealing with this company and I'm just going to stick with this one."
3.0,The foot insoles don’t have very good support or padding. Doesn’t make the shoe very comfortable to wear.
3.0,"I ordered the 6mm and it is wayyyyyyyy tiny, much smaller than I anticipated the size. I was thinking it was going to fit my daith piercing but it definitely will not. It's smaller than the hoop used for my tragus piercing. I'm not sure what you would wear a 6mm for but they weren't going to fit any of my piercings. Ended up returning because the jewelry was too small, quality of the seemed fine though, no weird smells."
3.0,Soo stinking cute but wish they were more stretchy! My 7 month old won't be able to wear them long :(
3.0,"I love the size of these earrings and they are very beautiful. However, the clap is way too tight for releasing the bar without bending the earrings. I will need to bend the clap open a bit, but not too much, otherwise the bar will not hold. -sigh- that is always difficult with the issue I have with my waist. Other than that, they are gorgeous and a great price for three colors."
3.0,"Actually, I found that one of the chains on the gold necklace was broken and I couldn't fix it. These necklaces are quite delicate and probably will break when used with the masks. I don't recommend these and I got a refund on them."
3.0,It just didn't look great on me.  I had to return it.
3.0,"It's okay, I wouldn't buy another one or recomend to any friend o family member. It looks fake from miles away. The shine of the ring comes in the room before you do."
3.0,"Wrong engraving was added,  however they were quickly replaced."
3.0,"I hate to give it 3 stars but, the shorts dont fit as shown in the pick. I am an athletic 5'10 188lbs. I have good thighs and glutes.  I ordered a L based off the vauge reviews and sizing recommendations. THese shorts are a little loose and have a cloth, baggy basketball short feel to it. They are comfy and all,but they are not the trim type shorts. Good SHORT!!! but not as expected"
3.0,Ran really small so I had to return them.  Overall not a bad quality but I wish there sizing were not so far off.
3.0,"The mask is okay compare the price to another, worth to buy. However a plastic sheld for eyes blurred and hard to see."
3.0,it took to long to get it but it is very pretty
3.0,"Beautiful outfits, however the stiching in the back came undone."
3.0,Shoes are fantastic and all but would've been nice if they sent the right color. Was so looking forward to having matching shoes and harness for my girl. Not worth a return but rather disappointed.
3.0,"Amazon showed the original price as $60, which I can't believe was accurate. It was sold for $20, which was more in line with its worth. The material didn't seem to be of the highest quality, and had to fix the top so it would stay closed. However, it was a nice little gift, especially with a tiny piece of paper inside with my birthday wish for the recipient."
3.0,I ordered a small but it fit like a large
3.0,"I like the way it fits and the material but the quality of the sewing is very bad. The pleats at the neck were already coming undone when I got it and the collar is separating from the rest of the top after only wearing it one time.Ill be keeping it but, ill have to re-sew it myself."
3.0,"This is a really nice watch would love to give it 5 stars but, due to the fact that it would not stay fastened and I lost it a few times once at home and then at work thank God that killed it for me. Be careful when you wear it!"
3.0,"MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR ONESIE BEFORE YOU WEAR IT IN PUBLIC!!<br />first of all sizing, this is my first onesie ever: im around 5'3 got the small and it fit pretty well and was pretty baggy still but length wise it was perfect....<br /><br />now onward to the product review:<br />got my stitch onesie late saturday afternoon and didnt check the onesie carefully enough. wore it to Disneyland literally the next day and within 10 minutes of walking into the the park the ZIPPER broke #_# and i had to hold the bottom part up with my completely different color legging showing (super embarassing). went to the the first aid place and got 4 safety pins to try to hold it up since after the zipper broke i realized it wasn't even sewn on properly. normally at the end of the zipper there is a plastic piece at the end that connects the 2 sides, well on this onesie it didnt have one. so of course my zipper wasn't working properly. after 3 rides and safety pins poking my butt and not holding up at all, i gave up on the onesie and changed out of it. once we finally got to sit down a bit i took out the onesie to try to fix it cause i had no spare jacket so i was freezing. got crafty and stuck one of my safety needles right at the end where the plastic piece was suppose to be. put the zipper back in and it stayed on the rest of the night. for the price yeah i know it wasn't too expensive but would like to at least put the zipper on properly since it sags right at the booty area.<br /><br />havent been to disney in like 6 years and really wanted to make this experience worth it cause 1. disney tickets are $$$ and 2. i'll be moving out of LA to europe so it would have probably been my last time. but sadly spend the first half of the day worry and fiddling with this onesie instead of enjoying the theme park"
3.0,So these earings came in. There were not what I ordered. The reason for 3 versus 1... they were cute enough and 2 pairs came in versus 1.... still preferred what I ordered but they'll do so I'll keep
3.0,Really pretty but very small.
3.0,Super short and made very small. Size up 2 sizes.  I returnd but had high hopes for it!
3.0,It is a nice jacket but a little larger than a 40 Short should be. I sent mine back because it was too roomy in the waist.
3.0,I sent these back because they have to much velcro and made my feet to bulky looking.  Love Vionic and the support they give in a sandal!
3.0,"Did the trick. Not the material we expected. Its thin and almost see through, more paper-like material than anything else"
3.0,poor material and even poorer design. doesn't even fit on my finger
3.0,"Like my other review, decent pair for the money. Comfy but lenses scratch easily."
3.0,"Great quality and beautifully made. Very flattering<br />Update: I’ve been using this swimsuit for a few months now, and it hasn’t held up very well. It’s fading all over and it stretched a lot."
3.0,"I’m always a xl, but this fits like a large. It is tight all around. I’m a size 14 and I almost always wear a xl. This is not a xl"
3.0,Very pretty fit nice but a little big in the chest area
3.0,"These looked elegant online, but in person they look very flimsy and childish.  The red is a very weird shade of red."
3.0,"I want to like the watch, but the bottom button fell off after I only had it for 3 weeks. I returned it and bought another one (because I liked it, otherwise), so hopefully the first watch was just a fluke. The pink circle is larger than I expected, but I only wear it while working out, so it doesn't bother me, but I'm not sure I could wear something that big all day. The pink is a nice, bright color, just like the picture, and the numbers are easy to read."
3.0,"The weight and color of this item were exactly as I was expecting. At 5'7&#34; and 205 lbs I bought the XL = US L, it fit great through the torso and hips over a medium weight sweater, however, the sleeves were too short and it was tight through the shoulders making it awkward to try and put the hood up. May have tried the next size up if I didn't need the item for a trip this weekend. Found a similar one that fit much better at the mall."
3.0,I wanted to like this sooo much but I had to return it. I wore it for 20mins. The back of my arm just by my arm pit were bring scraped. I like to dance...mix that plus the sweat and pain from the rubbing I couldn't so I returned it.  So beautiful but not worth the annoyance.
3.0,"The top loop handle ripped with in the first week. The zippers are totally inferior i.e. they're not easy to open and close, they get stuck . The shoulder strap is already starting to tear.<br /><br />I only gave it three stars since the price was right. You get what you pay for."
3.0,I bought this dress and it’s pretty but I expected to see pleats on the skirt and there are none. I wear a size 16 and bought an extra extra large and it just fits
3.0,Color is darker then shown
3.0,"I ordered the “assortment color 4 pack” and was sent a two pack of black underwear that were labeled incorrectly as blue and orange, when contacted about the issue, they sent another pack, but they were all black as well. I asked if there was a low stock or if they could send me the colored pack that I paid for, they said it’s out of their control as the items are chosen at random at the warehouse.  They fit fine, but be aware that they don’t have actual colors, just black. Don’t pay extra for something you can buy at target."
3.0,"Very cute and sexy, I ordered a plus size because I am 6 mo pregnant (about size 17/18) the robe fit comfortably- actually with lots of room to spare but the belt fit like a ‘one size’, it was a bit snug.<br />Otherwise, very cute, had a few strings to cut off but I’ll be wearing this one all the time. The color is beautiful and it washed great (in a delicate bag/ no dryer)."
3.0,"The cute of this dress is very cute and classic, but it (and most dresses made by Fair Indigo) runs very large. Their XS is like a small in most company dresses, so this one didn't fit me and there is no XXS option."
3.0,"I bought this bc I love to one I bought from another company on Amazon.. this one is not of the same quality.  It is thinner, doesn't tighten as much as needed, and loosens through the day not staying as adjusted."
3.0,"This would maybe fit a smaller child, not an adult (me) though. Should be mentioned in listing. Other than that the colors are beautiful, the stones nice and matte (NOT polished) the way I like them. Could not figure out if this a clasp that can be opened, needs some instruction. But it's probably as fixed decorative clasp/connector to close the bracelet. Unfortunately I have to return."
3.0,"The dress itself was not bad-- decent quality and the color and fit were true to the pictures and descriptions. However, I was disappointed when I tried it on to find that it was too big, being the smallest size offered. If you are on the smaller side, I would suggest going with a different dress, or pairing it with a belt at the waist."
3.0,I like it but the top part stings a little. I haven't used it yet just tried it on so far.
3.0,The mask itself is great but what I received is not at all what was pictured. I would have preferred what was pictured though the one I got is still cute and just as functional. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
3.0,"Great for driving during the day, Not so much at night. Even tho they make me look like a Father with his kids on vacation they are good to fight off the sun."
3.0,"I wanted to love these! I have been searching for the best leggings on Amazon (in the $20 and under price range) and these are not them. The speckled look ones are see through and thin. They might work for exercise if you don't mind showing what is on, or not on, underneath. I never washed them because I tried them on and decided I am going to return them, so I have no idea how they will hold up. I wish it fulfilled all my wishes. I do like the pockets on both sides though. They were big enough for my phone."
3.0,cheap necklace & somewhat looks cheap in person. glad it was inexpensive.
3.0,Thought it was going to be chunky but it is slim and long
3.0,this is for a small child.
3.0,Not as nice as I remember. Seems like the size is different. A little too skimpy for me.
3.0,"I really liked this shirt when I received it. It seems well made and looks exactly like the picture. However, it runs very small. I ordered a 2x and it fit my mother in law who wears large shirts. I would suggest ordering up at least 2 sizes."
3.0,"Great looking dress. Fit as expected, Came with a stain...dont know what happened"
3.0,"The sleeves are short.<br />Much lighter than expected, but not paper thin."
3.0,Fit more like a medium then a extra small
3.0,"I bought the black and white.<br /><br />The fit is snug which is what I like. Wraps around the torso nicely for me.<br /><br />The fabric is thin and a little bit stretchy. I think it's fine.<br /><br />The black, I would give 5 stars.<br /><br />The white, I'd give 1 star because of the ugly yellow discoloratian. That happens when either from sweat or water or idk what. And it doesn't come off. It's really ugly; which sad because other then that it's a really nice shirt. The stain is not an isolated incident too because I bought two white shirts and it happened to both."
3.0,It was awfully small.
3.0,One pair broke on the first wearing.  I still have two more but wouldn't count on these long term.
3.0,"The Hugitout Women's Natural Cowrie Shell Bracelet is a rather cute bracelet that I think you will either like for casual wear or just plain hate. I gave it to my girlfriend to try out and she did not like it one bit.  It does come in a nice pink flannel bag. The bag will make for a nice gift package, but that all will end rather quickly if the bracelet is not liked.<br /><br />I think the bracelet would appeal more to a teen than most adult women.  I think I am generous in giving it 3 Stars. There is no price listed at the present; so I can not say whether it is a good deal or not. Also as I said, I think this is basically cute costume jewelry, designed more with a teenager in mind.<br />Thanks!"
3.0,"Too small, but I kept because trying to lose weight anyway.  The fabric is not stretchy at all though, so buy a size up."
3.0,1. The box used to ship in is to small. It has put a couple wrinkles in the visors. I used a blow dryer to try and take out.<br />2. The sides go out a little to long. They stick out on the side.<br />3. I do like the cord vs plastic curly piece.
3.0,Sticky clasp but still cute. More yellow than gold though.
3.0,They don't tell you that the visor is very long and protrudes way more than a regular visor. They looked like beaks.
3.0,Too fitting. Too snug. Needed  next size.
3.0,"I love the all around look and feel. Every detail is nice, but my arm doesn’t fit."
3.0,"Drilled a hole in my wooden pole, now the pole is weakened. Seems to be working now.  I expect it to last for years, only time will tell"
3.0,Doesn't stay on a 3 yr old and is really thick.
3.0,"I ordered this outfit in green and in black. The green in medium was a little too snug so I sent it back and ordered a large. The large fit perfectly. I then ordered a black one in large and it was a terrible fit. The material appeared to be stretched out of shape, it was huge! I am not sure if my black large was mislabeled or if it was returned by someone who stretched it to the max. Either way I am bummed because it is a beautiful outfit and I want it in all colors. I am unsure of which fit I will get."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter that just turned 12 and is smaller than her peers. The dress fits a little snug (and has extra boob-room where she has none yet). The yellow fabric is thin, she might have to wear a white body suit under. But for the price it's ok."
3.0,"I'm average weight for 5'4"". The waist to leg is to long. So I have to roll the top waist area or keep pulling them up."
3.0,"This is a pretty piece, but the bracelet came broken and I am waiting for replacement.  I purchased this to wear with a specific outfit for a specific occasion that has already come and gone.  Still waiting for the replacement."
3.0,Didn't fit. So I can nog say how comfortable or useful they are. The tops wouldn't go over calves.
3.0,"Far too large for my daughter, I was looking for a bangle style and it's a bracelet for me..."
3.0,"I bought these in 3t, and they are at least a size small. They are actually form fitting on my smallest daughter, who wears a 2t."
3.0,super sheer all over and not dark like it appears at the best area
3.0,It’s a nice shirt. The printing could be better :/
3.0,OMG!  This swimsuit is super cute but it runs WAY too small.  I ordered a Large since I'm a US size 10 but I think even if I was size 6 my boobs would be exposed.  My bra size is 36-C and the amount of fabric on this barely covered half of my breasts.  I would consider the Large size is more like a Small in the US.<br /><br />I do have to say the quality is great and it looks well made.  Bummer!!!
3.0,"It's only 40 so far,  but honestly they are not any warmer than the ones I was replacing for those 30 days.. I got a size bigger and I still yank and yank to get them up."
3.0,The product fit well but they sent me the wrong pattern and color but still like it
3.0,Ugh I guess I just have to wait lose weight and then waer the dress omg like I guess
3.0,It was too small. I can't even wear it.
3.0,Fits  a little big
3.0,"This is a nice band, but it is very stiff"
3.0,This cap is quite large for my already large head. It looks a bit funky.
3.0,"Material is nice, color is nice, just not a flattering fit unless you’re quite slim. Makes me look much bigger than i am. It is comfortable and good for leggings, just won’t be what i reach for first."
3.0,It was a little loose but over all cute. Nothing special.
3.0,"Holds in the tummy nicely but also holds in the boobs!  For casual wear it's OK, comfortable, doesn't ride up, but not when you're trying to look your womanly best.  I am a size 16-18-ish, 40C,  and got size 1X."
3.0,NOT BLUE!!!!  The flower design is like a white/grey.  Not bright blue or any of the colors shown!  Very disappointed about that.  The glasses overall are nice.  I like them.  I just wanted Blue!<br /><br />So I returned the glasses that weren't blue and ordered another pair.  Guess What??? Still NOT BLUE!  They have a very faint bluish tone.  Maybe when sunlight shines on them they will look blue. Oh well.  I do like the way they look and fit.
3.0,Too big had to give away
3.0,I used to love these. Lasted a good few months before they started to break apart. I wasnt happy about that
3.0,"I don't think it's .925 sterling silver, i have a ring that has the same design...it is Sterling silver. It doesn't have the shine of silver."
3.0,Fits great and loose. Size fits normal
3.0,Item was received cracked and the lens had fallen out.
3.0,"Love the cut. Hate the fabric. Mine does not look like the photos and there is no way this is rayon. It is shiny polyester and spandex. But I hate returning stuff more than this stupid fabric so I will keep it. For reference, I am 5’8” 145 lbs and the medium fits really nice. Goes almost to the floor with flats. Too bad. I wanted to love this and get more colors"
3.0,"I was expecting the material to be softer, more cozy. I ordered a small, my regular size, however the sleeves were too short for me. However, a medium would have been too big for me. If you have long arms this might not be the best option."
3.0,Purchased for my 3 year old grandson who is on the &#34;small&#34; size but the shirt was too short for him.  I had purchased a 3T.  The pajama bottoms fit okay however.  So now I ordered a 4T to wear with the 3T top.
3.0,Way smaller than expected. Had to return it
3.0,It is smaller than I expected. Barely fits my phone (iphone max) and small wallet. But looks very nice and chic.
3.0,Just not what I was looking for
3.0,"I love the look of this wallet, but the quality is quite lacking. I had only had it for just a couple weeks when one of the card slots ripped away from the wallet. The material inside the wallet also looks like an oil was spilled on it as it is two different shades of brown and looks wet in spots. The outside of the wallet is pretty and I like the pocket options, but I'm worried about how long it will hold up."
3.0,Got them foo m wife she likes them
3.0,No era el tipo de material que esperava
3.0,Work well but these colors easily show dirt that is going to get on them from typical airport luggage handling.
3.0,This makeup takes several applications and doesn't last. I was really disappointed by the quality.
3.0,I love my heart off the ocean it's very pretty but I was alittle disappointed on the size of the heart
3.0,"I had high expectations about these jeans, and I'm disappointed. They do look very cute, and the color is beautiful, but they are very tight for the size and too short. I'm 5'9"" and wear size 8-10 pants. I ordered size 10, and it was uncomfortably tight, and much lower in the waist than I expected. Maybe skinny jeans are meant to be that tight, but if it feels uncomfortable back it goes. They are also quite short, not even reaching the ankle. I bought them to wear under the boots in winter, but they are too short for that. The material is only 56% cotton. In my understanding jeans must be made of at least 80% cotton, otherwise they're just jeans-looking pants, LOL Sadly I have to return them."
3.0,I wish it was more sturdy
3.0,Great shoe but.. didn't even last a month though. :( My 5 year old son is rough on his shoes and these didn't make the cut. Nice shoes though!
3.0,"The material is very thin,not as expected.The picture is deceiving,because it appears that the outfit is white and green,but it is grey and green.I was disappointed,but decided to keep it,but will not purchase again.Also the top was oversized."
3.0,Liked how cute it was but gold paint scratch off in a few wears...also was really flat it could have indented some more so it look like a ring and not a sticker
3.0,"Another good purchase from Amazon Prime. Ordered on Saturday afternoon and delivered to my mailbox on Monday, a federal holiday.<br /><br />Definitely had to revisit my original paperwork as this band and my watch are not a perfect color match, in my opinion.  Hopefully as time passes it will patina to match the watch. Otherwise, it was easy to replace worn out leather band with this one.  I'm still struggling to adjust the band to fit my wrist but it's okay for now."
3.0,"Very, very small!!!!"
3.0,"it was supposed to be long, I have bought them before from other companies and they are all the same, but this one was the length of the short nikibiki camis. but still has nice quality."
3.0,Not as soft as I had hoped. Good price
3.0,"Super cute and great fit. The first time I wore this the red color bled through to my jeans, even after washing it."
3.0,"I purchased this as a garden hat to keep the sun out of this old ladies eyes.  First I found the hat on the small side.  The brim is wide enough but the actual &#34;cap&#34; part that sits on your head wasn't wide enough. Kind of sat on top of my head so it would just fall off if I bent over.  I do not have a large head by anyone's standard.  I'm only 5'3&#34;.  First I thought about returning it but decided to take a chance and do some alterations since I only wanted it for the garden.  I removed the ribbon which is only attached in spots with dabs of glue...like the solder glue sticks you use for crafts.  That helped just a tad because there were a few places that were soldered incorrectly and had created a &#34;tuck&#34;.  It was still a bit too small though.  Finally I removed the strip of material that runs around the inside rim of the hat where the cap part attaches to the brim.  That loosened it a little more...enough so I could get a more secure fit.  There's a strap you can wear under your chin to keep the hat from falling off but I hate that in the heat.  When I was done I just tied the ribbon back on the hat.  I wouldn't buy another hat but I'll get enough use out of it.  I suspect it will loosen up a bit too with wear.  I also see a few spots on the inside of the hat were the straw weave is not secured properly.  I'll use dabs of that craft glue to secure the ends of the straw weave so the hat doesn't start to fall apart.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not impressed with the quality of this hat at all.  If you have a truly small head, it might be fine but it's not for the average size head in my opinion."
3.0,I thought they'd be more comfortable than they are
3.0,They run small and have a weird fit.
3.0,These are some nice shirts. They are not true compression shirts. They fit like a regular shirt from Walmart. I was expecting a T-shirt that was going to really flatten my Stomach.
3.0,"Pretty, but it is darker than shown in the photo, very green."
3.0,I will probably order more of these! Comfortable material and flattering fit. It was a little low cut so it made me feel more comfortable to wear something over my bra. It’s also an easy dress to nurse with!<br />Edit: LOVE this dress (ordered it in three colors) but just noticed (after washing it and wearing it) one of them has a safety pin in the bust…..so obviously somebody returned it and it wasn’t checked….lowering the stars a bit because of this 😅
3.0,"My friend likes it, good fit and nice to keep hands warm and still be able to use smart devices"
3.0,I ordered the white linen pants hoping that they wouldn't be completely see through. You can get away with wearing them out but they are a bit see through. Perfect for lounging around the house and has a nice soft fabric.
3.0,"The zipper slightly pops and catches no matter how many things are in it or not, no room for any cell phone, and it has a relatively cheap hand strap. I'm not complaining, you get what you pay for after all. I'm not going to buy the wallet again, but I'm not deeply regretting it at present."
3.0,"It's a bit cheap in quality, but for the price, still a good buy"
3.0,This was just ok. The color was really nice but it was too boxy for me. I’m 5’2” so maybe someone more average height would like this
3.0,The product is great it didn't discolor. ThThe issue I had is they look smaller than what the picture is. Maybe put a coin reference in the picture.  Otherwise they came on time and we're easy to get on and off. I'm just going to have to use them for earrings instead of the other piercing purpose.
3.0,"A little long for my preference, and wish they had just a little more compression. Overall pretty happy though as far as comfort goes!"
3.0,Nice shirt looks nice but order bigger size and it's very short people will see all your stomach
3.0,We bought for the beach and they rubbed blisters on her in mins. After that we just let her go barefoot and she did great on the sand but would’ve felt more comfortable knowing she had something to protect her feet. They just didn’t fit right. I had purchased these last year for her and they were amazing but seemed not to work as well this time.
3.0,Purchased the three XL even though I am typically an XL. I could barely get the romper over my hips and couldn’t get it over my shoulders. There’s no zipper in this romper so it makes putting it on very difficult. I wouldn’t recommend for girls with hips and boobs. Super cute romper if you’re actually able to get it on though.
3.0,The wavey ghost that looks like it is blank in the middle has WRITING on it.  I wanted it blank. That's why I ordered it. Not really happy because that was my favorite one.
3.0,Picked the wrong size. I need to return it.
3.0,"This looked really cute on the one reviewer who submitted a picture. I found it rather flimsy, and really thin. The color wasn't true either. It's not terrible, it's just not great. I returned."
3.0,I had ordered a metal band for my Apple Watch years ago and the magnet was a connected in one place. Now there are two areas where the metal attaches. Safer? Maybe but also more difficult to get it to fit properly.  Better with someone else helping but who wants that?  I feel it is always a little to loose. It looks good so I am wearing it but always afraid it is not snug enough.
3.0,Missing the first three pairs
3.0,Makes me really hot and i did not like that...also rubs my thighs the wrong way.
3.0,I love this band. Makes my Galaxy watch not slide around all day and it's pretty comfortable.<br />Unfortunately mine has broken. Bought it on 9/26. Even though it broke I would still use another one.<br />Three for the break. Otherwise great band.
3.0,The color does not match the picture.
3.0,The material is great but it’s heavy.
3.0,Got a 3xl but wear a 1x still it runs small
3.0,Semi dim light that feels strange to light. Might as well just be a plain gummy bear key chain. It is absolutely an adorable keychain though!
3.0,Good style but cheap material..
3.0,"I like the look of the lenses, but the optics leave a little to be desired.  Even a slight smudge is a pain to clean off, and causes a noticeable distortion.  I assume using glasses cleaning solution with a microfiber cloth will clean these.  The lenses picked up a couple dings within the first week of use, I haven't dropped them and use a case.  Bottom line, if I was in the market for lenses again I would look else where."
3.0,"The boots look great and are made very well. I ordered a size five and they are about a half size too big, also they are wider than expected."
3.0,"The malachite and Lapis lazuli are fake. The two I can positively identify as imitation make me doubt the authenticity of some of the rest. One of them was a poorly dyed agate, the colours were really artificial looking and bled into each other. However they're all still beautiful and well cut and polished. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy again due to the fakes. They were also a full month late, but maybe that's just bad luck."
3.0,it's really cute...but way too small and i ordered it a size larger than i usually wear (because of reviews).
3.0,"Awfully thin, stiff fabric. I have not washed them yet in part because there was no care instructions on the packaging. They look like they could be cotton or even a synthetic fiber. The packaging instilled no confidence that they are bamboo. They are pretty. Teraji P. Hall's portrayal of Ann Atwood in 'The Best of Enemies' set in the 70's made me think a ladies handkerchief might be a great summer accessory. Have not carried a ""hanky"" in years."
3.0,"Got these and they were wayyyyy too small. I usually wear a 32b so I ordered b cups and the pads look super awkward under clothes. The adhesive was fairly good, however, and the design did pull my chest together and held well"
3.0,Purchased as a gift for my sister. Skirt is better than what we were both expecting. It's a little large in the waist but she decided to keep it because it was tolerable.
3.0,"I really like the bags, but one zipper has already broken.  I have it on one of the coats I wear once a week or so, and probably unzipped it 5-10 times. The zipper really is cheap. But bag seems to be OK. I think I should have opted for spending a little more money to get a better quality bags."
3.0,"I was so excited to order this dress. I paid extra for 1 day shipping and it came the very next day. I ordered a size XL in teal. I read all of the reviews prior to ordering to decide on the right size. Unfortunately this dress is not flattering on me and I plan to return it tomorrow. I am 5’4, ~145 lbs. my measurements are 37/31/42. This dress was a loose in the upper body and waist. The bust area was a little loose but tolerable, the sleeves were HUGE. The waist was also super loose, I could easily gather and pull the fabric 8” out in front of my waist. Oddly the back of the dress cupped my butt in a not flattering way. So big everywhere except tight on the bum. Apparently my body and this dress are just not compatible. The fabric is a nice quality, plenty stretchy and the teal is a cute color but based on the fit, I’m not going to try this again. I would be willing to size down and try again if it wasn’t already making my butt look gross. I just couldn’t get past the gigantic arm holes too."
3.0,Sleek design.  The elastic band is just a whisker too tight.  Hard to get a single card out.  A just slightly weaker elastic band would make this perfect.
3.0,"These were nice but the variety I received were not the same as pictured and some where weird, like the lightning bolt ones"
3.0,I asked for a medium and got an extra large. It fit but I think maybe just large would have worked better. Still using it thanks to all of the different adjustments. Pretty good for the price especially compared to prices everywhere else.
3.0,charm is pretty but the chain cheapens it
3.0,These are much smaller than I thought they would be.  I wanted  them to be twice this size.  Too delicate for me.
3.0,"When washed, it shrinks considerably and also neees to be ironed before wearing."
3.0,Some of these airings are great. Others clamp too tight. Some fell apart. They are very cute for girls without pierced ears.
3.0,They still allow sun glare into my eyes.
3.0,"The fabric is pretty nice. It does have a sheen, and a matte finish would be nicer for a more casual look. That would have been okay. The collar itself is a good width for most women. The shoulders were really wide compared to the chest though... more like a men's cut. The shirt was reasonably shaped through the waist, but the shirt is SO SHORT compared to its width. I do have a long torso, but I'm not that tall. After washing/drying, I am certain this shirt would not be long enough for most average women. If you are very short or have a short torso, it might work for you. I ordered a Large... I normally wear a medium or large in US brands. It was ""almost"" the right size except for issues noted here (like a size 12-14 Petite)."
3.0,Didn't love the fit of the swim suit. Returned the suit and I'm waiting on my refund.
3.0,"Charm came with a chain where the clasp was affixed with fishing line. The charms loop broke off the top in the first few wears. Great idea for a little girl who loves Thomas like there is no tomorrow,  but lacks a little quality."
3.0,Very large in size for a medium-  cute-  but had to reorder
3.0,"It fits and is cute, except I got a short sleeved dress instead of the dress pictured. Disappointed but still cute."
3.0,"I was unhappy when the dress arrive to find out that it ran small, very small. Although it's a cute dress and I would love to own one if it ran for bigger size women"
3.0,Not as sturdy as had hope. But these umbrella can get real expansive. Make sure to purchase the base. Even at 10 mph breeze a lot of movement.
3.0,"I got what I paid for. The design and colour are very nice, but the quality leaves much to be desired. When the item arrived, half of the rhinestone heart was scattered in the package fallen off :-((<br />I was upset, but now I'm wearing it anyway cause people don't know the original design."
3.0,Poor quality cotton tee. Very heavy graphic appliqué. Fast and good shipping. Appeared as advertised.
3.0,good quality but i have to order one size more big.
3.0,"Love the look, quality is poor though. Broke in a few months of not so heavy use. At least it's cheap."
3.0,Really boxy.......
3.0,"These are cute purses for carrying your cell phone, 1 or 2 credit cards and some paper money.It is a VERY small purse without any storage space for much of anything.. DEFINITELY NO SPACE for ANY make-up!! If u just want to carry your phone with a little money, this is an easy, lightweight way to carry these things..but there is no storage space for anything else.This is a cute little purse for a young girl!!"
3.0,"I order size 10-12 .<br />They nice and good material, but my daughter is 10 not a big girl and they fit too small."
3.0,"Nicely made and fun but so heavy my 3.5 year old can't wear it. The headband is also big and round, so it just doesn't work well. Too bad, very cute."
3.0,"Super lightweight, I wanted something a little more substantial. Does pack back down easily."
3.0,"Bought to compliment a pink and purple costume, but unfortunately, it's pink and navy blue. Colors were not as advertised, but it fit well and there was plenty of material to fill it out."
3.0,Some of them won't latch
3.0,"Fabric not great and it did not give me the oversized look I wanted. For reference, I am 5’10 160 lbs 36 DD. I returned it"
3.0,"While these are exactly what I wanted them to look like, they are not as practical as I would like. After a few hours, they become very painful. I would recommend only wearing them for a certain event or a single day. They look great, but are not the type of ear jewelry that you can put on and forget about."
3.0,"I was a bit hesitant in ordering this, but the price was so attractive that i couldn't resist. I speculated that the band would be a light flimsy one, but when the item arrived i was surprised with the build quality. the band is heavy and well made. Swapping my old leather band with this new one was fairly easy. The band is smooth and comfortable around my wrist. I was very pleased with my purchase, Until one day, less than a week from the install day, i noticed cracks on the bottom glass of my watch.<br /><br />****The metal band when worn around the wrist, touches the edge of the glass bottom cover of the watch and puts pressure at this point, causing the glass to crack."
3.0,"Fit tight thru the chest. When I measured the actual dress, it wasn't true to what the size description was"
3.0,"Wrong color. I like the scarf, I just wish they would have sent me the right color. When contacted they didn’t respond."
3.0,its too thin and Balsani brand is thicker. We will se how long it will last me
3.0,I wanted a halloween hat for my dog and I knew this would be too big but I thought it could work. It ended up being really big on my own adult head but I was able to make it small enough for my dog. Its pretty decent quality just a little big for normal heads.
3.0,"I have attached the stock image from Amazon and the in-person picture of the Deku hoodie. While some discrepancies with color accuracy is to be anticipated, there is a SIGNIFICANT difference in color.<br /><br />I ordered this product because it seemed to be a light color, but ended up being much dark than anticipated.<br /><br />At least the color that came in is somewhat consistent with his hero uniform, I guess.<br /><br />Not entirely sure how I feel about the fit either."
3.0,"Nice watch, looks much more expensive than the price; however I do have to adjust the time daily as it runs a couple of minutes fast each day"
3.0,"I ordered a 3.5 for my 10 year old daughter, and they fit me, a 46 year old adult with a size 6.5 foot."
3.0,Cute but too wide for my face
3.0,Fast deliver they are very nice however look at the three pictures. The last one to your right is my earring looks same size as the picture #1. But picture 2 is the product I purchased from this seller. Kept them because they are a cute size but not the size I was looking for.
3.0,Love for lounging<br />Have several pair<br />Fit like pj sorties to the knee
3.0,"Material is good but fitting is wired, initially we bought large, it was too tight. Later we ordered xl and it was too large."
3.0,Second week of 7th grade and one strap has completely unraveled. Not recommended for school.
3.0,"You better have a small head and narrow nose. The lens is very very dark, almost a driving hazard unless you are in blazing sunshine."
3.0,Small for the size. Needed a bigger size
3.0,"If you are an XXL, don't buy this blouse. runs super small. Now I have to give it away.<br />Very beautiful though!"
3.0,tight in the arms
3.0,"nice , price is right"
3.0,only was able to use it once. it was pretty small for my newborn. she wasn't a big baby .. she was 7 lbs 12 oz.
3.0,Snug across my bottom. Too short to be a dress. Too dressy for jeans. Possibly leggings but not sure about that either.
3.0,Comfy once on but takes some work to get them on
3.0,"Really cute, but runs big."
3.0,"The fabric this dress is made of feels very scratchy and cheap.  I'm tall (5'10"") and wear a size 12/14, so I ordered an XL.  The waist of the dress hit under my bust and was very unflattering.  I decided to return it."
3.0,Good hats for my boys. Fits a bit large.
3.0,Nice belt but way too tight for a medium.
3.0,Not as much color as I had hoped. Just an ok pair of earrings.
3.0,Some stones fell out.
3.0,It's just weird fit. If you have no books maybe... mine are all the way out
3.0,For big litters girls not good
3.0,What I liked about the product was the colors. It's pretty uncomfortable very large sticks out like a large beak. The inner carbon filter doesn't fit the mask and the cartridges that let out moisture except her don't work properly unless you actually blow right into them. For that you have to press the mask on to your face real tight other than that they do not work. Wore it one time and I think that's about all I can handle.
3.0,Shape is as expected. Quality of fabric is poor.
3.0,The stone was much lighter than expected. Otherwise great.
3.0,could fit a little better
3.0,I ordered the black. It was a great fit and great quality fabric.  I give it 5 stars! I liked it so much I ordered the blue. It was NOT the same fit and the fabric was cheap. The hang tag was the same  but the tag sewn into the item was different. It simply was not the same item! I give the blue one zero stars. I'd now like to order another black one buy I'm afraid it will not be the same as the first one.
3.0,"Good quality,runs a bit big"
3.0,"I really like this necklace. You can wear them individually or in tandem. They layer well with other necklaces as well. However, it tangles easily. I spent 40 minutes untangling it. Then, while wearing it for the day it kept tangling over and over again. I really like how they look together but will wear them separately from now on. The hook holes in the back are great, gives you many options for length. Also, I like that the circle charm has a smooth side and a textured side. I’m all about options with my jewelry.<br /><br />I recommend storing these necklaces on a hanging post or separately in the plastic bags they came in, otherwise you’ll have a hot tangled mess. Overall, a good product. Out of 5 stars, I give it 3 for style and -2 for tangled."
3.0,Material is uncomfortable.
3.0,"The fabric is thinner, no compression and sizing was inaccurate for me. For reference, I always wear a size small in Nike leggings."
3.0,"I bought blue and white dress. Beautiful dress,material is much more heavy than expected  (don't like it),embroidery is very nice.Returning both dresses for the same reason. Short on me (I am 5'7&#34;) and INCREADABLY tight sleeves. Otherwise fit good on my size 18 body. It's becoming very frustrating with all this companies from China. If you are making oversized dress,make it longer and with larger sleeves. That's is so simple!  Dress is 2*,but added 1 more star for beautiful embroidery."
3.0,Huge! Size down.
3.0,"These earrings are cute but smaller than expected. They also don't look as nice on as they do in imagination because the bar attached to the earring back hangs differently based on your earlobe. Also, it's short so if you have large earlobes or if your hole is high, the back bar is barely seen. I have small ears and I barely see it on me. Just something to consider. Overall, they are cute and look like the picture so I have no complaint with the actual product, just wish the design were a little better."
3.0,"Nice organic shorts.  NOT A FUNCTIONING DRAWSTRING!<br /><br />I specifically bought these because I am a big lady who has a quarter dozen very slender kids.  Finding size 4slim is hard, so I look for functional drawstrings.  This drawstring is just decorative.<br /><br />Otherwise nice shorts."
3.0,"They have cute shapes and the pasley is attractive.  They make a nice accent piece where they won't be too stressed, like a hat."
3.0,"No me gustó que ya había comprado antes este lente y sus patas eran en pasta negras, gruesa y resistente, en cambio estos las tiene finas y de metal y no me gustaron así."
3.0,These did not come with backs and like to slip off of my ear.  Other than that they are fine.
3.0,"I like the bracelet but the drawback is as you move your wrist, the balls at the end unscrew themselves and slip off.<br />If you aren't careful you can lose them."
3.0,It is just OK
3.0,"Pretty light weight, but what I expected for the low cost.  Fairly disposable."
3.0,Not very well made.
3.0,Really cute outfit but the top just fits.  Runs small.
3.0,"The helmet looks amazing there were small discrepancy like the glue being visible in the visor, the paint job could a have used another layer and the delay time to received the item without notification of when it will arrive."
3.0,"The fabric bleeds when washed. Thus, the color of this blouse fades over time."
3.0,"I like the design and will wear them, but I bought them to go with my purple wedding theme and these are definitely more pink."
3.0,Very tight but slimming. Couldn't wear for awhile due to having engorged breasts and I got the XL.
3.0,I like it... Its just not stretchy so order a size up....
3.0,Great products. It was really an economical buy and the weight was low equating to minimal shipping cost. They are quite functional.
3.0,I got a large. I should have gotten a 2XL. But it fit. The material is VERY thin. It fits somewhat small but I can make it work with a jacket.
3.0,they strink when you dry them
3.0,"The picture show bright & cheerful colors of the dress. When I got it, it's dull. For the price I wear it in the house."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Length wise
3.0,Kid likes it but the quality of the jersey isn’t as it looks in the picture. The prices is quite high for the quality of the product
3.0,"They arrived with plenty of time. They look great. They are a Christmas gift for my husband so, I won't know how well they fit, feel, work until then."
3.0,I disnt realize how small this was. I think my grandfather has passed kidney stones larger than this.
3.0,fits ok. cheap material.
3.0,"Nice fit, and comfortable,  but the fridge was to long for my liking"
3.0,Not sure why these are much bigger than the other ones ordered. (All were medium) but these are too big
3.0,"Super cute and exact size it says, however it is very thin fabric."
3.0,"Smells like the funny smell of rubber combined with paint. The material feels nice to the touch, though. Not a lot of options for cheap, 3rd-party Flex 2 straps so these will do the job for now.<br /><br />Update: Been using this for over a month now. The paint smell already wore off. The rubber is still intact and feels high quality. One issue, though: The fasteners are quite loose that they loop around leaving the tail-end of the band dangling on my wrist. It happens a little too much."
3.0,"Gorgeous quality dress, but hard to zip, 4 hooks at neck. Takes a few minutes to get into."
3.0,"As noted before by a few - this is fairly short. I think I should have gotten a medium not a small as I did. The sleeves are long - which is fine - but I actually hate the thumb holes in this I didn’t know they would be there, I usually love thumb holes."
3.0,"waist and length were fine, however, the hips were a tad bit small for me."
3.0,"It's a good key ring. The bottle opener and light work well, but after first use the ring does not open anymore. It would be nice to remove the keys easily, but not a function I need everyday so I still use it."
3.0,A little small for me.
3.0,Pretty cute dress.Unfortunatly the fabric is a little see though on the top part and really cheap. I still wear it anyway because it's cute. I would have rated it 5 stars if it wasn't for the crapy cheap plasticy polyester material.
3.0,"I was charged for the set (top and bottom) but only received the top. Also, I imagined it would make me sweat a lot more during my 1.5 hour walk but there was only a slight difference."
3.0,Cute watch but so difficult to see the digital numbers and to press the button that activates the neon light was so hard it would be difficulty for an elderly person to press the highlight button
3.0,Not a quality garment. I returned it.
3.0,Fit as expected. Quality is not as nice as other brands in same price category.
3.0,Nice watch but battery died after a month.
3.0,"Comfortable, I ordered a size 10EE and the packaging said 10EE but the actual insert was a size 11EE which was printed on the bottom.  So I had to trim to fit.  Wasn't really a big deal."
3.0,Very large. Sent back 12/8. Still have not been refunded.
3.0,"This shirt runs about 2 sizes too small. I'm about 210lbs, 5feet 8 and typically wear an XL in all clothes. This XL ran more like a medium or tight large. I definitely suggest ordering at least 2 sizes up, 3 if you prefer baggy t shirts."
3.0,"This skirt runs EXTREMELY small. I ordered a M, per the other comments and it fit like an XS, maybe a S at the biggest. It’s also extremely short, so if you are tall, this won’t work for you..."
3.0,"good quality, but it was shorter than the original..."
3.0,"Looks great, but size was wrong.  The product description says to order the same as your pant size.  I take a 33 pant (sometimes 32, sometimes 34, depending on manufacturer) so ordered the 34"" belt.  Can't reach the first hole.  I recommend ordering 2"" larger than your pant size.<br /><br />For the more correct sizing, here's a cut/paste from the sellers website:<br /><br />Belt strap measurements are approximate (from strap end to first hole and strap end to last hole not including buckle):<br />30: 27.5"" - 32.5""<br />32: 30.5"" - 35""<br />34: 31.5"" - 36.5""<br />36: 33.5"" - 38.5""<br />38: 36"" - 40.5""<br />40: 37.5"" - 42.5"""
3.0,"Cheap quality, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"What I expected for the price. Tight around the thighs. Bought the XL after reading reviews, still a little snug."
3.0,Returned for the size.
3.0,"Cons, you can hardly see the name on hat"
3.0,"This dress looks like the picture; same material nice and shiny...but the skirt part doesn’t fit too pencil like, the shape I was going for. Also, it smelled really bad like it was in a moldy place before it was shipped. The fit was also a little loose but not to the point where I would have to take it to the tailors.. I am 36D or 38C, 126lbs, always wear medium.. hips 38’, waist 29’...5 ft. 2 inches, skirt part hits right under the knees.."
3.0,Comfortable but after several wears they already have a quarter size whole.
3.0,"Not a cool material. Pretty, but could not get the wrinkles out!"
3.0,Doesnt fit costa bloke glasses. Stiching is coming apart out of the box.
3.0,Cute but way bigger than i expected
3.0,Smaller than I thought it was going to be. Disappointed 😥
3.0,"IT SERVES THE PURPOSE. I THOUGHT IT'S A LITTLE FLIMSY BUT FOR THE PRICE, IT DOES THE TRICK. WOULD I BUY ANOTHER ONE IN A DIFFERENT COLOR? YES, BECAUSE I'M NOT TRYING TO IMPRESS ANYONE BUT PLEASE MYSELF."
3.0,item came in is too  large fits and looks like an xlarge great for  PJ's
3.0,They seemed to be made cheap but they have held up pretty well. They are very cute.
3.0,"You get what you pay for? I was expecting something a bit more sturdy, to be honest. It feels really cheap to me. But they work as sunglasses and don't look bad! maybe i am just picky."
3.0,"My daughter is a solid size 10, so I ordered a 10.5 to give her a little wiggle room. Unfortunately she couldn't get her foot into the shoe, and when I put it up to one of her smaller shoes it matched her size 9s."
3.0,"I'm giving this shirt 3 stars only because of the sizing. I was so looking forward to adding this to my wardrobe, but because it's too tight in the tummy area I'm sending it back. Also seems a bit short. There is no way this would fit me with the flowy style shown on the model. I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh 255 lb. I purchased a 3x. I would exchange for a size larger if they had it as I love the feel of the fabric and the design.[[ASIN:B01KUTXJ08 Lovaru Women's O Neck Feather Print Shirt Casual Cutout Sleeve Top Blouse (XXX-Large, Red 1)]]"
3.0,Really pretty but broke soon after it arrived. Was able to fix it. Not the greatest quality
3.0,"Cheap, you get what you pay for. But I couldn't pass up the sassiness of it, and for that it is worth it!"
3.0,It's pretty and will serve the purpose. However. Description states it is sterling silver. I looked all over and could not find a stamp.
3.0,"Had thought the pendant would of been bigger. The stone sets up top of  platform with the ability to gather light through the sides of the setting. That works well for such a small stone. The fake diamonds around the setting look cheap.<br /><br />The chain is horrible, box links, they pull on the skin, hair. Not an elegant or fine chain, and the chain is far too small for an adult - maybe okay for a child. I prefer chains that drop down above the chest. This one is short enough to be a choker, and the chain type feels cheap.<br /><br />I am shocked at what was received for the price. Guess since the company put a few on the Vine they think they need to charge more for what should of been maybe $30. Am not impressed with this company and won't recommend nor request any further items from them."
3.0,Love the fabric but it came with a small 6mm hole in it 😢
3.0,The product is too small and compresses the nerves causing my hands to go to sleep.  Please order up  in sizes.
3.0,"The first pair I got was in a different style and they were super cute but they snapped just from folding them.  So the company was really cool and told me to pick another pair on them.  I chose this style, they’re very cute, exactly what I expected, just that the quality isn’t that great. They’re a very thin and fragile frame.  The attachment that is on the part that goes behind your ear is loose.  I still wear them though because they are cute & this brand is affordable."
3.0,"I LOVE Lands End clothes especially for my TALL husband but was disappointed in the sleeve length and color. I love that Amazon Prime provides free shipping thru USPS but returns are by UPS and cost the customer $6 for pickup; it's ineligible for a drop off or in-store return. In the future, I will buy directly from Lands End."
3.0,"Too tight and no stretch. I've never had a problem with hats being too tight before. Literally - never.<br />Waited too long for delivery, only to be let down."
3.0,nice looking band. I just wish it had a locking safety catch. you get what you pay for. It did come with a spring bar removal tool and two new spring bars. That was a nice touch.
3.0,"Very thin material which I like, love the way it laces up in the front. I'm not a tinry girl but I'm not obese either, that being said it is a little snug thru the shoulders and stomach area. I would order at least a size up from what you normally wear."
3.0,Neat gift idea but the post fell off one before we even started.
3.0,Very cute but the red vision got me dizzy so I couldn’t keep them on for too long. My eyes couldn’t adjust to the color
3.0,"Nice apron, nicely made.  This style is nice because the straps CANNOT slip off your shoulders.  My issue with this apron is that the material is far too light.  It's like a thin muslin.  It's suitable for only the lightest protection, e.g., from dust.  I would not use it for any work involving water or painting, as you would definitely get wet and paint would seep through.  Too thin for potting, too, unless you are a lot neater than I am!<br /><br />In the end, too limited.  3 stars ..."
3.0,Very pretty but tent-like around waste
3.0,"I may have missed it, but I did NOT know that it was such a loose fitting garment. It made me look like a cow. I returned it."
3.0,I guess it's OK I've not worn one
3.0,"Hat has good shape and feel, but logo rubs off even before washing it."
3.0,I got a medium and the butt area fits like a large and gives it a dumpy feel while the waste was tight. Awkward fit all together
3.0,"Beautiful,  not big enough"
3.0,Bathing Suit Material.
3.0,"I like this purse, but there is too much lining. If you carry many, many things to weigh down the lining, then this is your purse."
3.0,"This dress is just okay. It’s definitely cheap and is totally see through which makes me so upset!  I am afraid to wear it in public, I may return it. But I got Coral color in size M... I am 5’7” 150lbs.  It fits me pretty well, it’s a typical size M fit, and is good as a casual dress but I wouldn’t recommend it for anything formal."
3.0,Too long for short smalker people
3.0,Beautiful but odd fit. Way too big on the back where the pretty lace is. I am not sure who has a back that large with the size I bought. Or lace was stretched out? Could be super cute but a little too cheap I think. I returned this dress. The company was great about the return though!
3.0,"I ordered this to be worn along w.a shirt I bought for my husband. We were going to be skeleton people. My first grievance with this shirt is that it didn't arrive until AFTER the date I needed it, so we ended up having to scramble to get new costumes. Which turned out great but was pretty stressful for me since I had been waiting. Second, and probably most important issue is the quality of the shirt itself. The tank was okay material wise, but the printing on it was really rough and looked like after 2 washed it might just fade off altogether. Would not order again."
3.0,Huge weird sleeves. Cut is strange. The body was big but after washed was too short.
3.0,Cheaply made.  I would not purchase again.
3.0,I would say this runs too small by a full size. Looks cute. Decent quality.<br />Good for summer.
3.0,The pants are nice but the run very small
3.0,If you are a small women the watch will be much to big.
3.0,I like it but its kind of flimsy. Not really sure how to describe it.
3.0,"Lovely color not true to size, chart not accurate made for smaller build women"
3.0,Product was thinner then expected
3.0,The straps were annoying and VERY hard to adjust. Once I got it on and in place it was fine. But getting it to where it needed to be took me probably 15 minutes! Ugh!
3.0,Under the brim is garnet a little distracting for golf.
3.0,So beautiful but disappointing! I purchased Black Flower and it’s Navy Blue. Had to give it to my daughter because I don’t wear blue.
3.0,It will work alright
3.0,Doesn't look like on the picture
3.0,"It's very cute, and I loved it when it first arrived. However, the two handles have drooped so that kitty face doesn't look as cute anymore. Looks kinda silly. It looks the cutest when the handles are up. It is still a nice purse, though. On the small side but big enough for the essentials."
3.0,"It runs a little big, cute idea to this jumpsuit , legs are really wide and material very heavy."
3.0,They were super fun but we could not use all of them bc some were broken or the light did not work.
3.0,Didnt know they were clip on. Have to change them to hooks myself at home but it’s ok for $9.
3.0,"I so wanted to love these pants!! For that reason, I feel I let a lot of things slide.<br />Pros: The color was so pretty! And the stretchy, yet held up throughout the day so it didn’t look like PJs. I sized up from my usual size and glad I did.<br />Cons: One of the pockets wasn’t completely sewn and it was open to leg. Again I wanted to love the pants so honestly, not a big deal, I was just going to stitch up pocket.<br />The front of the pants come up really high while the back was lower. Again I could deal.<br />What I don’t love about these pants was the fact that elastic waist band kept twisting while I wore them. Almost like the elastic was too big for the area it was sewn into.  After I washed them, the elastic was even worse. And I Lost patience with the pants and just left them in my laundry room to deal with another time."
3.0,"El acabado es malo ,los botones estan flojos y en la falda esta todo desilado el falsoy los ojales de los botones,y a la verdad no es como en la foto"
3.0,Its beautiful! But when you where it on your hip there is a huge space where gemstones aren't present...makes you look fat or like the belt doesnt fit
3.0,Very thin. Took forever to arrive.
3.0,Kinda cheap made its almost see through!
3.0,It's great. Holds a lot of stuff. Smelled a bit funny. Not as reflective as I was looking for but still very pretty.
3.0,I love the shape however it got stuck in my piercing and without straightening it out it would’ve had to be surgically removed.
3.0,"These are a little smaller than what I was thinking they would be. The posts are on the thicker side, my wife complained, and don't sparkle much, unlike the picture. But my wife does like them enough to wear them all the time. But for what you pay, they are bad little earrings."
3.0,Buena calidad AAA Made in China
3.0,I want to love these shoes but the tongues always come out like this. It only takes a few minutes of wear and they pop right out. It’s annoying and I’m worried that it’s going to shorten the life of the shoe.
3.0,"Cute. Wanted to love it but, a bit small even when I ordered up."
3.0,it is ok  fore this price
3.0,Nothing great to note about this costume. I ended up not needing it thankfully as it was a back up costume for my dog. The quality looks really cheap and would probably break easily.
3.0,Color not even close to picture/description. It was a really pale tan. I exchanged it for a different color and it was accurate. Good quality watchband but the color is way off on this one - disappointing because I really liked the color shown. I got the dark brown one instead. Free return at least.
3.0,"They're okay, just too small. Had to try mine on without socks and still too tight. Also, the calf area is tight and I have regular to medium size calves.<br />And the bottom has designs on it, but it's surface is smooth, no grip. So if you walk on another smooth surface, you're likely to slip.<br />The qualiy seems okay, being that I  JUST got them. They came folded in a shoebox. Mine look like a pearl white.<br />I ordered these for the cheap price and I THOUGHT they came in my size. I also have boots very similar to these that I ordered from Sears/Kmart. These are just a bit taller, a wider strap and a different brand. And of course color.<br />May have to send them back cause there's no way I can get away with wearing them. If only they had a 12! Or they could try making them true to size, that might help."
3.0,Thought they were regular t-shirts. They have athletic breath holes in them.
3.0,I have a normal size wrist and am fairly large boned. While I like the watch a lot the band is ridiculously large. I have to take it to a jeweler to get a link or two taken out. Annoying.
3.0,These gloves are cute and warm but not as described. They do not work with the touchscreen. I don’t know if you can see in the photo but they appear to have touchscreen pads but they lack the texture needed to work the touchscreen. Very disappointed in these and I am returning.
3.0,Don’t try it. It looks adorable but it’s too short.
3.0,I wish the hoop wasn't as big but it was easy to put on. Im still wearing it though.
3.0,"Very pretty, but the post is super thick and there was no way we could get them in my daughter's ears."
3.0,Was so excited to get these with the dark camo print. The heal seems slippery and there was some lumps or bubbles on one side of heel. Not impressed.
3.0,"These were nice looking shoes, but were too small for hubby."
3.0,Not as durable as we'd of liked.
3.0,I'm 5' 4  36D 169lbs<br />I bought a large fits a bit snug across the back.  An XL would fit better. The length is good. The material is<br />fine however not denim color as pictured on model but as is pictured in the other pics.
3.0,The material rides up and I felt like I had to constantly keep pulling it down.
3.0,"These could've been great pants - BUT they roll down on my waist INCESSANTLY - wearing them now and not sure that I'll ever wear them again it's that annoying. They are also WAY too long - several inches too long - and so I have to constantly refold at the ankles so as not to step on them. I'm just really disappointed, because the style and material are great."
3.0,They are cute.  The images were not centered.  The material is definitely thin and cheap.  Very cheaply made.  It will not help with like the flu or a cold.  But my kid likes to use it to play ninja.  Pretty much all that it is good for.
3.0,Love the necklace but it came broke was very disappointed was able to fix it one of the links was missing so disappointed planned to wear it the next day with a dress hope it want come a loose######
3.0,They fit small. The size is more like a size 6.
3.0,Beautiful design but the stems on back are very short. I'm afraid to wear them. Don't want to lose one.
3.0,tooooo large for me
3.0,This is about the same size as a men's casio gshock-definitely not a child's watch. My 8 year old is wearing it because of the adjustable band but it looks gigantic on him.  All of the functions work and it's as described except for the &#34;child&#34; part.
3.0,It was not really high waisted. I tried pulling them all the way up but they wouldn’t budge. Thinner than I anticipated. Does feel thinly lined with fleece.
3.0,Falls off nose area too easily.
3.0,Not much compression in these compression shirts<br />But they do make a nice smooth undershirt<br />I Wear them all the time
3.0,"I had ordered a Large and loved it but it was too big (it is true to size). The material was a thin sweater like with really nice stitching. So I decided to hold on to it. Then I ordered a Med and I got so disappointed.  The material is more like a T-shirt , the stitching is all crooked and has loose threads everywhere.  The sleeves are long enough to cover my hands on both sizes, kind of weird.  Same company, 2 completely different sweaters.  So I’m returning both.  Although, The color is a really pretty yellow mustard."
3.0,sewing is poor quality. The seem completely ripped while wearing for the first time. An easy fix fortunately but when wearing it after is ripped further on the original. I will need to reinforce the entire seem. Otherwise its comfortable and I enjoy it.
3.0,"My son loves it, he's a huge fan. I wouldn't buy again though. The quality isn't worth the price imo."
3.0,The material is kind of weird but they fit okay. Slightly disappointed
3.0,Smaller than what I expected.How I measured and how they measured is way off I guess. Hardly can get my big hands in the back pocket when its on. Gotta take it off to get to my cash in the back pocket. Kind of defeats the purpose of having it on the waist there. Color is nice though and it is made very well. If it was a decent size It would have been perfect. As it is Im adjusting to the smaller size but missing a lot of the stuff I generally carry in my bag. I think it would be nice if it was explained from where to where do you measure the bag because it sure isn't what I thought it should have been.
3.0,They run small compared to shoes.
3.0,Not made very well fall apart and discolor quickly
3.0,"I have four Tumi nylon bags, and there are all better quality than this one. It is also too small for me. I will be returning it. I ordered a Michael Kors tote instead, and I am hoping that would work form me"
3.0,"Item runs small, order next size up. The color I ordered was the soft pink and the color received was Barbie pink."
3.0,Vendor service is fine; however pants were not true to size.
3.0,"This is cute, but pretty sure it's a fake. No authentication logo inside, just a ""made in China"" tag. It's decent quality and looks as pictured, though."
3.0,Sleeves way to loose. Nice fabric
3.0,Well made but to much compression per Dr.
3.0,The case clip broke within minutes of being used.  Why bother putting one on if it's useless?<br /><br />Glasses work well.
3.0,Jacket fits nice and pains fit nice but the bottom of legs is not as pencil straight as I thought they were.
3.0,"Pros:<br />I loved the color and style of this dress, and it fit well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wore the dress once, and the stitching is already coming apart in three different places.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy from this brand again, because I am not in the habit of buying clothes that only last through one wearing."
3.0,Great color. Very soft. Zipper too stiff. Missed seeing  grrrr about 3 inches on hood seam.
3.0,The fabric is very thin but it still looks cute
3.0,"It's cute, fits just right but smells horrible and is definitely NOT a sweatshirt.  This is a long sleeve t-shirt.  Not even close to sweatshirt material or weight."
3.0,Too short in the back. Would recommend
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this today and it looked beautiful... until I tried it on.  It looked nice, but the arms were too long for my more petite 5'3"" stature. The details were pretty and there were no loose threads. The knit fabric was a good medium weight and it looked solidly constructed. Nothing appeared to be cheap or shoddy. The color was lovey and it looked beautiful when I took it out of the bag. Unfortunately, this top just did not fit right. I have a large chest and perhaps that affected it? Although I have never had that issue before, even if a top was snug.  It felt like I was wearing it backwards. I kept checking the neckline to see if the tag was in front. Nope. Pity, it was a pretty color and solidly constructed."
3.0,Cheaply made and way too big for me. 😞
3.0,The red bled on to the white stripe
3.0,"I'm busty and have to wear this collar under a pretty thick shirt if I don't want to see the outline of the edges. I haven't had too much success wearing it because of that issue. Also, if I have any makeup applied when I put the collar on, it will end up all over the collar due to the narrow neck. Wish it worked better for me because it's made well and the Peter Pan style is really cute."
3.0,"When I got this bracelet, it was in a silver box making it an ideal gift for a girl or boyfriend. So when I took it out, it was so tiny and I had NO idea whatsoever to make it wide to put around my wrist. So all you're supposed to do is yank the sides apart - trust me you're not gonna break it. I absolutely love the little leaf that comes in the center, it's very intricate. Another reviewer said some of the colors bleed when exposed to water which is making me paranoid about having anything watery with me. But other than that, I love it for the color<br /><br />Edit: After 3 days, the little knot at the bottom where the two petals comes together broke apart after 3-4 days of daily use. Disappointed, because as I wear it daily it's going to keep unraveling till the knot is gone."
3.0,"These pants were good and bad.  As a woman with  32"" waist an almost 50"" hip, finding clothes is a challenge. These looked good once on. ,  am short-waisted 5'6"" and the waist almost hit my bra strap CONS: getting the narrow waist over the hips, even with zipper down was a delicate operation.  They do wrinkle badly, are hand-wash, and the color faded significantly. I was never able to totally get wrinkle free.  PROS: THey are a nice wide leg, matte fabric great for curvy small waist-large hip/thigh figures."
3.0,These are super cute. These are really big and don’t fit me let alone my children...
3.0,"I thought I was getting three boxes of cookies. I only received one box. The description of what you get is misleading.<br />However, the cookies are good."
3.0,really good for the price
3.0,"Maybe it's because I have a neck like a tree trunk,  but these didn't let my readers hang down far enough to be out from under my chin. Neither comfortable nor easy to use."
3.0,"I’m 5’4” and 135lbs. Fits good, little big but good for a beach cover up. Tiny bit see-thru but that’s fine for the beach. I ordered white and it looks a little night gown / hospital gown so I’m returning but getting a different color."
3.0,"I bought a size 4-5 and it seemed fine and the print is cute so I stuck them in the wash. When I was folding laundry, I discovered they were marked 6-7 on the inside. I am not sure if mine were mislabeled or not, but they are the exact size as my daughter's other undies in a 4-5. So, I am confused as to what size I actually have but whatever I have do fit like a 4-5. The underwear itself washed well, but agree with another reviewer that the leg holes are a bit big."
3.0,"OK I get the idea about this jewelry piece.  In theory it's awesome, you can use any necklace you own and make it a trio.<br />The problem with this is that once you have the three necklaces attached, it's a royal PITA to get the clasp latched.  The clasp rotates no matter how hard you try and the lobster clasp is really tiny. I would stick with the magnetic clasps."
3.0,Runs waaaayyyyyy small. Can’t wear it.
3.0,The sock size seems a little big because there is a small bunch of fabric that my heel can't fill which then bunches up and pushes outside the shoe.
3.0,"These were much shorter than I expected, but I still like :)"
3.0,"This bra is very cute! The band and cups on this bra are very comfortable, and the straps are wide and don't dig into my shoulders. However, the straps are loosened as far as they can go (which isn't much) and still where the strap meets the cup, it digs painfully into my armpit area.  The straps don't feel too tight, so I think the issue is the seam/hook where the strap connects to the cup.  It's not just mildly annoying, it made a sore area there after I took the bra off."
3.0,"Wife's Review: I was excited about this bikini as it looks a lot like the Beach Bunny suits that I have, but at a much lower price point. I now know why. What appear to be silver metal hooks on the top and bottoms are actually plastic, and somewhat flimsy plastic at that. The top is very skimpy and if you have larger breasts (I'm a 34D) you're either going to be exposing your nipples or revealing a lot of under boob, there's no way around it. The bottoms are ok, but the side straps are very thin and you have to tie them in a knot to get them to hold. They're extremely stretchy like a thin rubber band and I would have no confidence at the beach, and certainly not getting in the water, that I would lose the bottoms and that the top might be up around my neck as I was getting out. They really need to up the quality on this one, even if they have to charge a little bit more for it. It would then be worth the money, but not until. I'll be saving this for our private hot tub so it won't matter if it falls off as I'm getting in or out."
3.0,I love these hats. I have been buying them for years at a Lids store in my local mall. That store left the mall so I had no choice but to order on line. I ordered the same size I always do  L-XL and it's too small. I'm pretty disappointed
3.0,Not as form fitting as I would have liked.
3.0,"These are the widest calf boots I've found, but the shaft is very tall.  It painfully cuts into the back of my leg when I walk because it goes slightly over my knee.  I'm 5'3""."
3.0,Got 2 sizes large and barely fit!
3.0,Not effective. Leaves eye strain. Still better than nothing
3.0,I love the style but the designs on it were of bad quality which was cracked and seemed old. I got 50% refund on it. This product is worth 50% of the real price for sure. It looks good on me though.
3.0,I got XXL and m 5'7 135 soooooo sizing is way off. The shirts will work perfect for a workout. I'm not one to wear facny workout clothes but clothes that serve a function. This shirt doesn't absorb sweat dries quick. Nice
3.0,"Not sure that they are the correct size, as i ordered my normal shoe size,  i put them on for a couple hours at night to try on but found i had to take them of again after a few hours, as the legs started to ache a little, is this the norm for these on  long haul Airline flights?  iam not sure..  just not a snug fit, quite tight to get on as well.<br />Russell."
3.0,I read plenty of reviews before buying this for my husband. He said the eye holes felt sharp and uncomfortable. I don't know why everyone is raving about it and it doesn't fit my husband.
3.0,Not true to lense prescription
3.0,"It seems OK, but too small for my eye sockets.  These either press into my eyese from the top or the bottom - will not rest comfortably around my eyes at all."
3.0,"RUNS SMALL, SWEATSHIRT MATERIAL"
3.0,"This is cute but runs really small, Asian sizing I guess. You will need to order up a couple sizes. I’m 5’2” and 125, I got the small and actually LOL’d when I pulled it out because it looked like sized for a child. I was going to return but it actually fits my 11 y/o daughter well so I gave it to her."
3.0,"I've ordered tons of pieces from Ana Silver. I love them all. I like this one as well, but there are some sharp spots around the etchings that have scraped my skin or gotten caught on fabric. Plus, the 3- strips that form the band feel a bit thin."
3.0,"I'm usually  a large ,5""3 160 pounds I workout,  so I should've gotten a x-large.  Too tight  The material is good.  The goggles are too loose.  Can't wear."
3.0,They kind of seemed cheap but they did the job.
3.0,Warm enough but didn't fit me. To large for my size 7 head
3.0,cute but a little too small
3.0,I was really excited about this ring when it arrived.  It is so beautiful!  That was until I noticed it was missing a stone.  I haven’t been wearing it for that reason.  Hopefully it was just a one time thing.  If not for that I would be wearing this all the time.  It truly is a gorgeous ring!
3.0,The top was too small but the skirt fit well. They are both itchy due to the material.
3.0,"The material used is not moisture wicking. So if you sweat like I do during workouts your tank is going to look like you entered a wet tshirt contest. Alternatively, if you don't sweat much, these tanks look and fit great. I'm 6-1, 230, athletic build. XL worked perfect."
3.0,Too small.  Size 16 top is tight on my skinny 12 year old boy.  He's below average size.  Pants seem to fit.
3.0,Meh. Was kind of a waste of my money. I can’t raise my arms without expose most of my stomach
3.0,I purchased the burgundy in xl fits ok. It is hard to buy clothes online. The color is as represented. The material is nice but a little thin and the tag says hand wash.
3.0,These are really big for a small
3.0,Husband hated the feel of the material.  Linen scratchy. Bought xl or xxl. I don’t remember. It fit
3.0,"Love the fabric but way big for a medium size, I'm not to short and it went way passed my knees and I understand their meant to be long but just not long to me."
3.0,Fits really small so size up. Material is not good snags very easily.
3.0,"Nice but not perfect. I am 135 lb and 5'6. The 29 in inseam is perfect for me. I do not like when my sweater drag on the floor. I sized up and ordered a medium to accommodate my growing pregnant belly. Overall, I like the pockets, softness and weight of these pants. I do not like how wide the legs are, they are not flattering at all (my own fault as I failed to realized they are a wide leg style pant.) The width of the leg on these pants is 12.5 inches wide (hoping that shrinks after a few rounds through the dryer.) They also do not have an elastic waist band like mentioned in the description. The drawstring is short. I have to keep them tied for them to stay up on my hips."
3.0,"I have the “29 Lyk-blue” color option in this hoodie. That design is a colorful nebula on a black background. The space design starts at the shoulders, goes onto the sleeves, and flows down the body of the hoodie. The back of the hoodie has the same nebula. The hood is plain black; one of the product photos shows the hood as having the design and a different photo shows it as plain black. The hood is lined with black.<br /><br />The sizing is about an inch smaller than the size chart. I have a size small hoodie. After washing, the chest measurement is approximately 41 inches. The size chart says size small is 42.6 inches. The hoodie narrows at the waist, that measurement is 34 inches.<br /><br />I usually wear a men’s small in tees and sweatshirts; I expected this hoodie would run small. It fits, but I can feel it pulling at the back if I cross my arms. The hoodie has a little stretch but not a lot. It’s made from a mix of 95% polyester and 5% spandex.<br /><br />It’s a lightweight hoodie, so it’s not super warm. The material is kind of slick, or maybe slippery is a better way to describe it. It’s not fleecy or sweatshirt material.<br /><br />The care tag says to hand wash, I don’t know anyone that’s going to hand wash a hoodie. The description says machine wash, and that’s what I did. The hoodie did not shrink in the washer or dryer, and the print didn’t fade at all.<br /><br />There are a few construction issues on my hoodie. The seams are puckered around the kangaroo pocket, so there’s a permanent wrinkle. The seam on the top of the hood is stretched out, so I can see some of the stitches."
3.0,Was to small for me
3.0,The strings are not strong enough for the weight of the mask
3.0,Is good for your price
3.0,"Cute socks and they fit well prior to washing but as you can see, the gray pair shrunk much more than the dark pair and will no longer fit despite being washed in the same load. Had to return them unfortunately."
3.0,A little disappointed only 2 pair actually fit gave tje others to my grandkids to wear.
3.0,"Pay no attention to the size chart oh, they run super small"
3.0,I've used this headband a whole lot cuz I absolutely loved it and I paid good money for it but unfortunately after a month or so the Nike sign starts to peel off I don't know if it's cuz it's cheap or if that just happens with all the Nike headbands but I wouldn't really recommend this item for long term
3.0,Came in broken and all tangled .... sad bc the material is nice
3.0,These are a little too big for my 23 lb 2 year old. They do fit better then the smallest pair of underwater I've been able to find in stores. The material feels more of spandex then cotton. Directions say hand wash. Sorry not hand washing all of my daughter's underwater. Washed with her other clothes on delicate cycle and dried on low.
3.0,"I bought 2 pairs at the exact same time, and they were both different. 1 fit and way different material. These were to small and not the same stretchy material. Very disappointing. They're cute, if they were right."
3.0,"In description it shows, order a size up. Which I did or thought I did since the size sent was a L but wanted XXL. Pants looked good, material on point. Will make sure to reorder RIGHT size this time."
3.0,"Black one has lasted well,  it purple one edges have all frayed even in a zipper bag on gentle. Both have been washed as well."
3.0,"I like my maxi dresses to come to my feet, this one comes to my ankles. I'm about 5'6&#34; and ordered a large."
3.0,"My toddler doesn't like them, I don't think they feel secure enough.  He is 2.5 and has a large head too."
3.0,"Size up, waist runs very small"
3.0,"I really like how it fits, it fits comfortably around my waist but the only thing is that it is kinda short in the back area.(thicc bih) Just a caution to everyone thicker. :) Very cozy so I will give them that."
3.0,Cute watch but paid $15. The sticker on the watch says $4.99.
3.0,They feel like clown shoes
3.0,"Buy a size bigger then usual. Skirt is a very stiff fabric, hoping with washing it will be a soft skirt."
3.0,"This raincoat is for sure not a plastic coated rain coat.  Very thin tent-like material.  My daughter loves the look of it & can easily put it in her backpack on days it may rain.  I used scotch guard on it - 2 layers on the outside, 2 layers on the inside - to give better protection.  This is basically just another water resistant - not waterproof - layer between you & rain.  You will get wet if you are in any kind of heavy rain. I recommend this for very light protection.  While I love this garment, it is not truly a raincoat as advertised & does not thoroughly protect you from the rain, so I gave it only 3 stars even though it is well made for what the material is."
3.0,"It's okay. I got what I paid for. It took a long time to get here. The first time I tried to put it on, the chain on the end came apart. It was a minor repair."
3.0,Cute but way too tight in the bust area.
3.0,I like this one
3.0,"When I put them on, the sides stick out, weird. I don't think they fit tight at the waist and get bigger and baggy."
3.0,"Fit as expected, a little tight around the toes. These heels scare me. I took some steps in my kitchen and obviously need to work on walking in them before I go out in public as to avoid looking like a baby deer.<br />They are beautiful though, with a gorgeous silhouette that I can see peeping out from a midi skirt, or with a great pair of skinny jeans.<br />The landing when you take a step is kind of hard on your knees if that makes any sense, these are obviously not boots that you will be wearing all day comfortably.<br />I bought some gel heel inserts, so I'm hoping that they won't make the shoe fit too tight and will make it a little bit more doable. the sole of the shoe is not soft or lenient.<br />It does feel like a $50 boot. you get what you get for the price, and it's fair."
3.0,"Super high waisted- and that’s the only part of the pant that has any compression, resulting in tight on waist/ribcage and looser in hips. Not sure if I’m keeping these. The fabric is super soft and stretchy. I have never had workout pants this high waisted and only snug in the waist."
3.0,Runs VERY small!
3.0,It’s super cute but... very low cut not like the pic. It almost went to my navel. It’s just a couple quick stitches and it’s fine though :)
3.0,The strap is nice.  The clips look silvertone on the website but they are more like bass colored.  The site should list the color of the clips.  Does not match my bag and too cheap to bother returning
3.0,"These are pretty good pants for work. I chose the size based on my hips, where they fit well - however, they're a little loose at the waist and thighs, but tight around the calves, so they bunch up at the knee. I think a larger size would be too big overall, so I'm hoping the bottoms of the legs stretch more with wear. I'll update my review if the fit improves with more washes and wearing. Even with the fit issues, they're pretty comfortable, which is the main reason I decided to keep them."
3.0,"Print is decent, but fit is weird. It’s oddly fitted around the waist (but not in a flattering way) but baggy everywhere else."
3.0,I bought these for my 9-year old grandson who is very lean and athletic. These shoes run very wide so keep that in mind before purchasing.
3.0,Don't love it. Don't hate it.
3.0,"They are very pliable and they seem to be cheap quality, but then again they were cheap! lol"
3.0,"Super soft, but short"
3.0,"The leggings are pretty good material.. they fit well(ish).. I’m in the waist but my legs and butt area seem to be almost see through when I squat in these. I’m constantly pulling the fabric up to stay.. if you’re not sweating then the material slides down. I purchased another pair similar to this brand and I like their material 10x better as it’s thinner fabric, stays put, AND squat proof. I would probably just wear these out and about, or to the gym when it’s not leg day."
3.0,"Great price and great color, great price.  I will say that some of the toes are irregular.  That's ok  I cut the ends off but a couple of the big toes needed to be stretched at the neck of the big.  For the price and the colors, the alterations were not a problem."
3.0,"I say somewhat small but what I really mean is that this hoody is confused. No biggie though! It’s comfy, fits as a good layer and who doesn’t like black? Okay, the sizing is a bit odd since it’s short on the torso and arms but is rather roomy. It’s got some bag to it but damn it’s comfy.<br />A little thin for a northern set city but it’d be great for spring and fall, and as mentioned earlier, use it as a layer. The quilting pattern is unique and subtle so don’t feel too pompous in your new hoody. I’d say get it, if you like slimmer fit styles, keep on looking."
3.0,"Readout cute,  but it just feels and looks like it won't last too long.  I haven't had any issues yet,  so I'm being truly careful with the way and dry process"
3.0,Dress looks nice but runs big. I ordered 2-3. My daughter usually wears 2-3T and this fits more like a 4T
3.0,"The top is too short, we were disappointed, but didn't have time to return it."
3.0,Adorable little outfit. The tutu is fairly sparse in terms of fluff but it was cute and not too in the way of the party
3.0,"Not a style I liked. Not manly enough. Material was ok, but the style was just not for me."
3.0,Just a regular hand band with buttons probably better making your own<br />Did not work for mask either
3.0,Very cute but the thin post tore off when I was putting them on for the second time.
3.0,Love. Light weight
3.0,"It was a mediocre box , nothing special"
3.0,when I got the dress out of the package I notice a yellow light brown stain at the bottom of the dress . And one of the button came off easily .
3.0,"Was expecting thicker fabric since it is described as a ""Sweatshirt Top"".  Cute design though, wish it was thicker."
3.0,"soft, like slipper"
3.0,"Nice realistic to movie look, but nearly impossible to breathe when worn. Solid latex with no holes."
3.0,Cute style but the material is really thin (you'll need a slip) but it's way too small.
3.0,"Fit is good even over corrective lenses, comfortable. These lenses are NOT polarized. NOT. That test strip is not a proper test."
3.0,These socks are very short.
3.0,"I am 5'6"" tall and I find it runs short on me..."
3.0,"cute watch and very affordable. but mine didn't work. i tried to contact the seller, asking about maybe it being the battery. I haven't had time to get a new battery, so i'm not sure how it works (or if it does)."
3.0,"I love this style dress in the FLOWER pattern, so I bought the exact same size & style in the animal print.  I am so sad to say that the animal print is much tighter across the chest.  That is unfortunate, because it is such a cute dress.  I am a 32D and it is super tight.  Even trying to adjust the straps doesn't work.  I will either return this ... or I will remove the elastic in the back to see if that would make a difference.  If the flower pattern is available in the T2 style, I highly recommend it!  If you choose the T2 animal print, you may find it fits differently."
3.0,Loved the fit hated the material .
3.0,"Size was perfect. I ordered a medium and it fit as a medium. However, the seam down the crouch is fantastic if you like camel toe, which I don’t."
3.0,"I didnt even bother to try bending over in these - there was a huge gap in the back of them.<br /><br />The legs and thigh area fit me well.  The length was what I'd describe as 'normal' .... they certainly were not 'ankle' length on me.<br /><br />The fabric is soft and stretches well - I could tell they would be comfy.  I might get them tailored at the waist to get them to fit better.  Currently, I'd describe them as unwearable by me."
3.0,"i purchased these  gloves a few weeks a go.  The main reason I selected this pair was because of the the warmth value they advertised. (-30)  Overall a great pair of gloves I thought. Two weeks ago it was 10 degrees out and just finished snowing. I needed to snow blow my driveway and my neighbors which means I will be out side for almost two hours.  It took 45 minutes and my fingers were getting very cold. The water proof membrane held up so my hands weren't wet, but they were cold. Had to go inside and warm up. Stuck the gloves in the dryer to warm them up. Disappointed..."
3.0,They look bigger in the picture.  The quality for me could be better.
3.0,Picture deceptively shows 5 pair which is what i though i was getting but description says 3. I got 3 so 3 stars it is.
3.0,"I wear a size 6 or 8 in mainstream brands, so I ordered a medium. When it arrived, I was excited and took it right out of the package and could see right away it would be way too small - it looks like a size 2 to me (not that I've ever worn a size 2!). I tried anyway, but stepping into it, I couldn't get it higher than my thigh. For comparison, I took a picture of it laying flat on top of a black Size 8 Calvin Klein dress. You can see that the waist, torso, and shoulders are MUCH tinier than a size 8.<br /><br />That said, it looks very, very cute. If it fit, I'd have a lot of fun wearing it to a party, date or even a wedding. It seems well-made, the black piping is a nice detail, and the fabric is soft and comfortable seeming. So, order away, but order WAY up in size."
3.0,these were a little small and narrow.
3.0,snug but usable.
3.0,a bit small and tight. I feel like I'm wearing boxer briefs and they ride up real quick. they are soft tho.
3.0,"The dress is not made out of material that it looks to be made of in picture. It has no give. The dress is one size too small if you have larger or muscular arms and a larger chest. You will need to order a size up. Also, the material is on the thin side and probably doesn’t need to be dried on high heat when washed. Lastly, the dress’s colors are as pictured. Very vibrant and pretty. Order up a size if you want this dress though."
3.0,Ordered according to bust size and it was too big.
3.0,Was really disappointed and confused when this came in the mail and the earrings weren’t a matching set. What you see pictured is exactly what you get so I can’t be too mad but it doesn’t exactly make sense. I’m either just gonna make it work with my other earrings or just buy a second set eventually
3.0,Very Pretty but sized too small!
3.0,The length is fine but the part that goes up and over to the waist is weird fits fine in front but not in the back and very slick material that is always rolling down
3.0,"Haven't had the opportunity to wear this yet, as I mainly got it for work but when it came in the mail, I realized it was too short for my job and the dress code guidelines, but I think it will be a great skirt to wear on Independence Day!"
3.0,"Very pretty short, but the got is way to small"
3.0,if you are short it will  look like picture I am 5.7 and they looked like a diaper
3.0,It's to bulky for i-phone 6 & 6s. Good for 6 plus
3.0,"It loos okay, the strap feels kind of cheap, but oh well, $20, I guess it's okay."
3.0,It broke the 1st time I use it but it's easy to fix
3.0,"Not bad. Im a sz 12, so got the Xlg. Fits pretty good. Got it to wear as a dress with leggings. As long as they are not sheer tights or leggings it may work, because its pretty short, especially in front. The bottom button buttons right at your....and mine is not as long in back as it is in the pic. Also, a button was missing off 1 cuff, you can tell it was never there. Didnt come with extra. But i like it so im gonna keep it and just sew another button on. I like the material, i wouldnt call it flannel material, more like just a heavier shirt."
3.0,"I'm bald so I shouldn't be surprised that an &#34;one size&#34; hat is too big. Tag says don't wash but one cycle in hot shrunk it a little. Maybe two more and it'll fit. Good looking hat, though."
3.0,"I got this for my 13 year old son, they appear to be a bit cumbersome. He wanted something that he could try to help him decide if in fact this would be a type of jewelry to wear. His friends seemed to like it. You can't complain for the price."
3.0,Way too big when it stretches out. I have a 34&#34; waist. Wouldn't recommend for 36&#34; or smaller waist.
3.0,Buena Relación precio/valor
3.0,"These lens are great replacments for the originals that come with these frames. However, to get the lens to snap into place is such a big hassle and pop out relatively easy making the process to place them very annoying. If you get them to stay though, they are very stylish."
3.0,"I was really impressed with his backpack! I bought it for my first grader, and she loves a lot! Especially the keychain! I was kind of wishing the lunch bag was a little bit bigger, but that’s OK. Definitely a great product for the price"
3.0,"Soft fabric, not see through. Surprisingly though, the legs weren't hemmed. I'm 6' and weigh 152 lbs. I ordered a small and they are tight. Not sure if a medium would be just right or too big but since there are other workout pant brands that I like better that are hemmed, I'm not going to order more to find out.<br />Tag says they are made in China (just fyi if that is a purchase making point for you)"
3.0,"The metal caps are absurd. My shoes had been nice and quiet.  After adding the caps, ""klack, clink, plink, click, flickity, flackety!"" So annoying to have folks look down and say, ""What's that noise? Is that your shoes? What's on your laces? Metal tubes or something? Huh. Do you like them? I think that would bug the heck out of me.  Bet my cats would dig 'em, tho!"" And so on...<br />And at that point, you've cut the ends off, no going back from that.  Even melting the ends only held the stuffing in for a while.<br />Ended up junking them after 2 days."
3.0,Although I love the message the type is so small it’s difficult to read
3.0,They are abit big for me.
3.0,Loved it but made cheep had to stitch to reinforce the bottom of the top section. But after I repaired it was fine hand wash line dry
3.0,The material on the band of the watch scratched off right when I closed it on my rist but I am not returning it because that's what I excoect from a product like this
3.0,"They're a decent fit and do not stretch over time. My only gripe, there is no crotch hole to allow easy access when needing to urinate."
3.0,"i am normally a large in shirts, occasionally a medium. i read other reviewers that fit this profile suggesting a size small for compression. the small was great, the medium would have looked like a normal tank, the large would have hung off of me."
3.0,"This is absolutely adorable, however after 2 washes, and obviously not hard use in a kinder ballet class the stiches for the toulle skirt was coming undone. Grandma has had to reinforce it a couple of times"
3.0,the painting is messy on some where you aren't quite sure what the item is.  Overall not impressed
3.0,The neck gaiter is very convenient since the gaiter remains around my neck so I never forget my mask as I enter and exit stores and work. Although this is convenient I struggle with eating the gaiter when I try to talk to others wearing it around my nose and mouth. The material is light and breathable and I do still wear these some but prefer the masks over the gaiter when speaking to others wearing a covering over my face and nose
3.0,"Bought these to wear as undershirts and for layering. Problem Waists are same width as bottom hem.  Don't know about other women but I have a more curvy bust and hip area.  That means when something is tight on the hips it is naturally going to roll-up to the more narrow waist area.  Ugh, buy a size or two up; I did, and they still roll-up. Overall these are comfy, but will roll-up,"
3.0,I do love the one I got the only thing is after having it for a month the changs started to break on them they seem easy to fix tho so I've give it that
3.0,Little tight for a knit cap but over all great hat
3.0,"The feathers were soft, full and flattering,  a very well designed accessory"
3.0,I love this shirt I miss seeing this brand around but was happy I could find it . Maybe I've just gotten bigger but it seems to run a little small compared to my other brands in size large.
3.0,"Nice weight, but the neckline is a little large/wide and the sleeves are a little short, making it fit slightly awkward.  I'm only 5'2, so I'm not used to sleeves being a little short. I wore it at work over the winter, and at times I layered it with fingerless gloves to keep my hands/wrists warm."
3.0,Good for the price. You get what you pay for. Cheap material
3.0,"Loved the pants, loose, and soft material. The top was attractive, but smaller than an XL."
3.0,like the look and feel of these briefs but wore the blue pair today and within 20 minutes my balls fell out the sides as the crotch has zero support due to the cheap fabric they use to make these.  I am going to guess after one wash they will be all mis-shapen
3.0,"I ended up using this bag for my sewing material. Originally, I wanted it for work but to my surprise if was significantly larger than expected. If you want a large briefcase style bag, then this is the bag for you. If you need something small, I would go with a different one."
3.0,I ordered an XL because I have big chest. The top came in triangle & was very small.
3.0,Looks good but too shiny and the material is average. Expected more. Mot exactly as picture.
3.0,"It was cute, but it did just turn out too boxy and shapeless on me. I did return it. I was looking for a lightweight dress to wear to a summer graduation and it just was too heavy. The pattern and color were just like the photo, though, and very nice."
3.0,"Cute, I like the look. hopefully will be a comfortable wear around shoes for errands"
3.0,"Little flimsy, great size! Not as effective for blue light as others on the market"
3.0,Came in a very nice box with a cloth. The strap is a very nice leather. Face is a little large for me but nice looking and did not care for the white hands. Received a letter stating that there was an error and I got the watch cheaper than I should have and made me feel bad for them because they stated that they  had to borrow from friends to compensate for all the orders done in error
3.0,returned for a larger size
3.0,they are smaller than expected
3.0,There is a hole in the right pocket. A size 1X would fit better.
3.0,"there is no drawstring on the one I got, only elastic. I'll have to pin it to keep my hair from falling out :-("
3.0,Did not like the pagota roof sleeves. The<br />sleeves sloped outward and looked weird. Dissapointed that the design was not on the back of the shirt but rather all red. The fit for a large was good and the chest patch was nice. 3 stars for the fit and patch. 0 stars for the sleeve look and design<br /> only in the front.
3.0,If they're little bit bigger but they look exactly like the picture
3.0,i wanted it for a 2016 gold dime so it did not work for me
3.0,fits as expected. the bottoms are cheeky and do show more than normal bottoms but not too much.
3.0,"I have not use the bands yet. However, I did use the face guard which interferes with the clips holding the watch band. This causes the watchband to disengage you can lose your Fitbit at the flick of a wrist. This happened fortunately while I was asleep I woke up and I did not have my Fitbit onIt came off."
3.0,Id definitely go up a size. I got my size which is xl and it fit more like a M/L
3.0,"My only issue with this specific binder is that it's very difficult to get on. If you're able to get the one that's more like a sports bra, I would recommend it. They're a lot easier to pull onto your torso."
3.0,Wrong item.. suppose to be a charm for bracelet ; it's a key ring charm ?
3.0,"I’m almost 70, I think if I was a lot younger I would have loved this dress. I’m a  petite/small and the medium was tight on me."
3.0,The silver quality is beautiful. The heart's are huge. I give it 3 stars only because the size of the hearts give it more of a feel of costume jewelry.
3.0,Charm is big. About an inch and a half.  I also had to use some red nail polish to touch up paint as it was poorly done.  Good for Snow White cosplay/disneybound.
3.0,Purchased these to wear for a hiking trip. A tad tight. Think they'll be fine.
3.0,They were all extremely tight for my head :/ I don't have a large head or anything so maybe these are made on the smaller side. Tried stretching it out but it didn't work too well. Otherwise they're cute and the quality is there
3.0,"Love the colors of this shirt. It looks better in person and I actually love the fit as well. The issue I have with it is that it wrinkles REALLY easily. I steamed it before wearing it the first time and had it looking perfect. But after wearing it for no more than 30 minutes, it was substantially wrinkled again. Especially at the belt where the shirt folds from sitting down. Pretty normal for it to happen, just not as much as it did and so quickly. It’s an inexpensive shirt, so I can’t complain too much. It was just a bummer. If it weren’t for this, it would definitely be one of my favorite shirts. No question."
3.0,Cute design but cut too short.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 110 lbs and size small was too short to look right with leggings.  I returned it for a refund.
3.0,"I purchased the silver ones that were amazing. Then I got the green ones and after 1 wash, all of the strings and seams came out! I exchanged for another one thinking it was just a defected one, but nope. The second green one did the same thing. I was terribly disappointed because my little LOVES this type of pjs."
3.0,I ordered a large it’s more like an extra large . Product quality is good nice material.
3.0,"The shirt is nice quality. The color and pattern is as pictured. However, I decided to return this shirt because I don't like how it hits my shoulders. The picture shows the woman's shoulders mostly covered, but on me my entire arm is exposed atopping rightag the top of my shoulders. I don't really like that on me."
3.0,"As comfortable as any other leather band. If you’re too rough it will break off, but is easy to fix"
3.0,Not really impressed me like the picture.
3.0,"I’ve usually found it to be the case that the bigger the size clothing, the bigger your chest is supposed to be. I haven’t experienced an XS size with a C cup requirement before. My daughter is 15 and totally in proportion, but the chest is gaping on this. Too bad I bought it as a gift because the return date expired."
3.0,Didn’t like the big polka dots.. ordered normal size .. too large .  I opted to return. Appreciated the he response from seller.
3.0,It’s very tiny for a medium fits more like an x-small
3.0,"Love the feel of the dress, silky. My friends with small butts, this is not the dress for us! Made my small butt be non-existant. So I had to return it. I would recommend wearing a slip with it because it does cling to your body, and not in a flattering way"
3.0,has a funny fit
3.0,"Shirt is great, it just several weeks to arrive and was almost two weeks past the estimated arrival date."
3.0,I was really excited to get this Ravenclaw ring. It does fit me nicely and feels comfortable on my finger. The band is stretchy so easy to get both on and off. The main CON is that the print design is pretty cheaply done. The blue is missing from portions of the design and “Hogwarts” is not on the ring at all. I’ve included pictures of the ring I got so you can see for yourself. I’m pretty bummed and probably won’t be showing this off anytime.
3.0,"It’s super misleading to sell a single earring. I should have paid closer attention and read the reviews, but still... that’s so lame. However, I one earring that came is gorgeous and great for the price. I have to order another and wait another month for it to get to me, which is really annoying. $3 plus $1 shipping for a really fun pair of earrings isn’t too bad though."
3.0,"The material is excellent, especially for the price. Just right weight. Soft on the inside, firm and shiny on the outside. I just got it, but it seems like it will not wrinkle easily and will last a while.<br /><br />This fit perfectly everywhere except the bust. It doesn't make sense to me that the waist would be so roomy and the chest area so tight. Especially since there was extra room in the upper back area. It's like they just didn't know how to distribute the fabric or something. Also, I'm not sure why dresses are still being made with back zippers. Side zippers are so much easier for consumers to handle.<br /><br />Overall it's still cute, though. The tightness in the bust area is easy to feel, but at least it doesn't look too tight while it's on (so others can't see your pain lol). So I'm considering keeping it anyways. Maybe I can have it let out a bit or something."
3.0,The sleeves are a bit large as lengthwise.  If u look in the picture the sleeves do fit as it looks but I would go maybe 2 sizes up because the body fits small
3.0,"My goodness, this shirt is genuinely so transparent! I’m wearing a yellow shirt underneath, and you can even tell that the color is yellow, as opposed to tan like my skin. I wouldn’t really wear this without an undershirt, because I even think a nude bra would show up. Aside from that obvious issue, which is pretty serious, this is a decent shirt. Nice fit, and with no obvious defects. See photos—hope this review helps you!"
3.0,"Fit is good, only issue I have with these is the padding is a lesser quality than other pairs I own"
3.0,cheap... but the company sent me another and between the two I have one.. nice look
3.0,"Dulled quickly, copper color shows through"
3.0,"Nice soft fabric. Good pictures. 2 of the clips broke after a month use, however I used a ring to fix that problem."
3.0,It too small for me
3.0,Love the style. But really thin and flimsy.
3.0,"Love the fabric, super soft. The shirts are short waisted, and too tight."
3.0,"I love the mesh backing, it is the same color at the shirt not sheer likely appears in the picture. Arm holes were a bit tight. The shirt is definitely more fitted than it is loose and with the tie it ends up coming up a little higher than I like. But it’s good quality and the color is so vibrant so I will be keeping it."
3.0,Material was a little flimsy
3.0,I ordered these earrings for my daughter to wear in a formal interview.  The earrings were smaller than expected and looked cheap.  Needless to say she did not wear them.
3.0,Great product but came with one missing glasses
3.0,Beautiful ring loved the setting! However was very disappointed that the tanzanite stone faded to a VERY pale lilac in about two months!!!
3.0,The shirt is really pretty and good quality I just bought a size too big... should've got a medium.
3.0,It's a little bit heavy
3.0,Did not realize this scarf was black and white.
3.0,Good quality but too tight for my head.
3.0,"Is what I thought it was, nice for the price"
3.0,"I bought the gold one for my mom since our family dog passed away recently. She has only had it for 1 month, she’s retired so she doesn’t wear it all the time and it’s already tarnished on the paws and around the edges. It is very cute but don’t know if it’s worth the money. Hopefully a polishing cloth will clean it up."
3.0,"I like this shirt, but the material at the neck is not stretchy enough to go over the shoulder like in the picture"
3.0,wife's looking for dresses for her graduation.  this fitting is too small around her waist.  lace was nice but the zippers were made a little not too high quality.
3.0,"The glasses themselves are great. Very lightweight. My issue is, as I find with most brands with this design, is that the rubber/over the ear pieces always fall off. I have multiple Ironman brand glasses, same problem. Searching for a brand/model where this is not an issue. I have not looked hard enough, they must be out there."
3.0,I love this bracelet.<br />So disappointed the clasp fell off.<br />I am keeping it anyway and will fix it..
3.0,It's a nice hat but it usbt as wide brimmed as it looks.<br />Package didn't arrive when it was suppose to
3.0,Love the color but the material is super thin.
3.0,"The dress is a cute design but the sleeves are really, really tight. The lines on the dress also don’t line up with the sleeves so it looks a little weird, but it would’ve been cute except for those two reasons."
3.0,"The pics are really cute but the fabric is very thin, especially when stretched on the foot"
3.0,"Great material, but if anyone orders these they should order one size larger than they normally would. Mine ended up being one size too small even though the tag says it ought to be my size."
3.0,"This is a super cute top!  But, it's snug in the chest area.  I would consider my size average and have not had that problem before.  I would go up a size if I could do it over."
3.0,"It's kool, looks great as expected,BUT it DOESN'T work"
3.0,Got today. Not suede. Zipper is open to bottom. Not a pocket at all. Wearable but not what it was advertised.<br /><br />*Update*<br />Raised the stars a bit due to the company messaging with an apology and a refund. Very nice of them. Wish the boots had a pocket though.
3.0,They twist the ankle
3.0,"These are really cute! But they're really cheap and flimsy. Two of mine broke as I was trying them on. I can fix them and buy new clasps, but I shouldn't have to do that 🙄"
3.0,"Shirts are great. Material was awesome for wearing during a mud-obstacle 5k. Only problem I have is that I ordered mediums (US) and they came as US: small, Europe: Medium."
3.0,"The dress was cute and true to size. Came with a little hole that got bigger, I decided not to return as my daughter wanted to wear it. Just a jacket to cover it."
3.0,Does not look at all as pictured but is still nice looking.
3.0,The kimono I got is shorter than what shows in the photos. And its not because of my height.. I'm 5'1&#34;. Wish it was longer but its still nice.
3.0,"So I do Like these.<br /><br />They are not the best quality. You will have to sew them a few times. Hand sewing is not enough. you need to have a sewing machine. After about 2 months I had to restitch them, then they were fine. Pro Tip, Sew the foot straps on an angle and they will be more comfortable. You just need to use them on the same side every time.<br /><br />You will also have to bend the clips every once in a while to get the tension back on the clips.<br /><br />It can and will rip thin shirt material so be ware of that. Two shirts I love have holes now. To get around this fold over the bottom of the shirt at least once before inserting in the clip, This way you get more surface tension and the jaws wont just stretch it out as much.<br /><br />Some shirt material will slip right out of the jaws. I its embarrassing to have one slip off when you are trying to pitch to a customer and pop out under your pant leg..... whats even worse is when bolth of them pop off and slide out under your pant leg in the middle of a meeting. If they would redesign the clip with a locking rod on the top this would not happen, but the clip is only a spring clamp.<br /><br />I do use these just about every day but don't expect them to hold up out of the box."
3.0,"Okay for the price, not heavy duty, it will shrink."
3.0,"These shoes are way smaller than what the size indicates.  My daughter normally wears between a size 2 1/2 to a 3, but after reading the reviews I ordered a size four to be safe, and she couldn't even get her foot in there and I still have to return them.  The shoes are very cute, but I would order at least 2 sizes larger than normal."
3.0,Too revealing at the busts
3.0,"Material isn’t terrible, but definitely on the cheap side. Definitely should only be worn for casual events."
3.0,"Very nice looking watch.  The GMT hand runs a little slow, have to reset it every other day."
3.0,Picture seemed like a more padded bra
3.0,"I'm not a fan of the white Jade. To be fair, they do mention that the plugs vary due to the natural differences of the materials, but one plug was very white (like the picture) and the other almost translucent. I wouldn't order them again."
3.0,Wrist band was not a large more like a medium...
3.0,"It’s not a bad item. The printing is cute and the colors are nice. I can tell it’s cheaper fabric than the ones I purchase at Universal and it’s not as sturdy. Won’t hold up to any pins that is for sure, it’s a thinner strip of fabric and of A Lesser density also. The clear ID holder is open on the top, no closure, and is very cheap in quality. It’s worth the money, but just don’t expect it to be really high quality. It’s just ok."
3.0,"It is exactly as advertised and very bright pretty colors, it's just not what I wanted.  It's really big.  I wanted something a bit smaller to wear on my head in the car when the wind is blowing through my hair.  This is way way too big for that.  It would be a wonderful addition around a skirt."
3.0,"I’m in XL in Houston, TX but apparently not anywhere else. The suits are beautiful and may look great on someone who can fit a medium."
3.0,"It's a pretty ring, but it's not the one in the picture. I gave it 3 stars for the wierd angle/bend ,and also for not being the correct ring as described in picture."
3.0,Its colorful. Quality wise and say You get what you pay for. If you’re looking for sun protection this offers some but not enough. I would spend more on a better quality product. This product is perfect for gifts.
3.0,This was very large a little hard to adjust for a size so I just returned it
3.0,Just a little too small for my fat wrists. Very high quality...just wish it was a little bigger.
3.0,Beautiful watch. Week & day numerals too small. Difficult to read. Keeps excellent time. Worth the money.
3.0,"These are absolutely beautiful but very stiff and heavy. My kid couldn’t walk with them. Maybe better for the older kids but for the younger ones, not so much."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress!  The print (I got the bubblegum pink floral) was GORGEOUS,  it fit perfectly and was SO flattering. However, it was very thin and see-through (I do not have the patience to wear a slip in the summer heat), and arrived a total wrinkled mess.  I ordered it specifically for a vacation trip, and do not want to deal with ironing the entire dress before each wear, so unfortunately I am returning it. If it were a different fabric I would buy it again in a heartbeat, as it really had some great qualities, but the sheerness and wrinkly fabric are just total deal-breakers for me."
3.0,"Belt is okay for its money. Somewhat cheap looking but it was cheap in cost. One size fits most is actually pretty small. If you like these styles of belts with just a little &#34;give&#34; and your waist is larger than 28&#34;, it will be way too tight on you. Just fyi."
3.0,"I like the watch and it blings like crazy in the light.Its way  too big for my small wrists so I will see if I can have some of the links removed.If not, I'll unfortunately have to return it."
3.0,Doesn't feel right with underwear under it.
3.0,"This product was ok, but hard to link up."
3.0,"it looks nicer on screen, but a good gift for my toddler daughters. for the price, I will nod mind too much if they get lost or damaged."
3.0,"Very soft, but the inseam is too dang short. Another 3 inches and they would be perfect."
3.0,"So obviously this is not the same dress. I bought the dress not only for the style, but also for the pattern in the fabric. Its not the same fabric and if you look closely as the straps, they are the same. So basically, i bought the dress for the things i just stated, but when i received them, it was not the same. But on the good side, if you like the style, its definitely the dress for you ..."
3.0,"This was cute, just to thin for my comfort."
3.0,It seems very nicely made and is very pretty. It is a bit too small so I'm not sure about support and wearability
3.0,They work well. However I was surprised by how large some of them are.
3.0,"I loved the show and received a lot of compliments on the shade, but it lasted about 3 months of regular use before it started crumbling apart. For the price, I expected a little more durability."
3.0,I ordered it a couple times didnt get it but when she did get it she liked it and it was good.
3.0,"They aren’t as vibrant as I would expect but for the price they’re pretty good. The reason I rated it 3 instead of 4 is that mine had a weird smell. Like I’ll touch the earrings and the smell is on my hand it’s not pleasant, it’s like rubber sweat. Still going to try them and edit once I wear for a week.<br />Edit: they did not irritate my ears (however my ears aren’t normally super sensitive) however if you tend to forget to take them off in the shower it gives a itchy sensation. They don’t like water. The 3 stars still stands."
3.0,"It's a nice case, but too small for sunglasses."
3.0,"Tends to retain foot odor, otherwise adequate"
3.0,I have gotten other jewelry for this piercing so I know it was the correct size. The snake is just too stretched out over it making it hard to put in and it has no movement because of how tight it is in the ear:
3.0,They are too big for my 3 year-old daughter. I think they can fit better in a 6 year-old kid.
3.0,The suit was much larger than expected.
3.0,"I ended up with two pairs of these. The color options were so tempting I couldn't help myself. The other aspect that appealed to me was the French terry cotton fabric.  I waited until these were washed and worn a couple times before submitting my review. In spite of washing them on delicate in warm water and only partially drying them, large portions of stitching around the waist and pockets came loose on both pairs. From reading other reviews, this seems to be common. I won't order them again."
3.0,"I ordered this dress in red and black. The red is really nice and fits well (besides the material being a little thin). However, the black is made from a different material that feels weird on the outside. Its kind of shiny and not very soft. The dress itself was pretty but I returned it because of the material."
3.0,I really like the concept of the zipper boots. They look good and feel well made. First off when the item arrived there weren't any type of instructions on how to lace the zippers into the boot. I had to do research on the internet and watch a lot of different videos. I ended up going through several different lacing options before I ended up just making up my own way which worked best for me. Now that I have had them for several weeks I would say the are semi-well made. I did have several stitchings come out which I had to cut and burn with a lighter in fear of them falling apart. The zipper sticks half way up on both which causes me to have a little trouble zipping them. I tried wd40 which was recommended by people on the internet but that made no change. And lastly I feel that these things are entirely too large. They make my boots look a lot fatter then they are. I have them laced as close and as tight to the eyelets as possible and the boots are still not as tight on my feet as they should be.
3.0,It looks like it has pockets but it doesn’t.  Women need pockets.
3.0,"Super cute style, and I love the blue tinted lenses, but the frames are much bigger than they appear in the picture and leave dents in my nose when I wear them."
3.0,These were nice and fit well but clearly were designed for someone with very pale warm/yellow tones. I am fair but more olive toned so they just did not look good. I will probably return them and try the brown tinted ones so at least it looks like the skin tone is not supposed to match.
3.0,"Item looked cheap, not well made.  I would've liked it to be wider as a belt, but for the price it was okay."
3.0,Kind of small...
3.0,Its a average wallet. Wish ut had more credit card pockets. I'm not a big fan of the material it made out of.
3.0,"Everyday watch, it's okay."
3.0,"Like it, but black cover in the belt clip fell after a month"
3.0,"I was under the impression that this bag would've been of higher quality than what I received. It looks like it is shown, but the material is very cheap. Especially the leather part. This is the kind of bag i would take somewhere I'm not worried about it getting a little messed up at."
3.0,They fit as expected. The skirt is made of cotton and does not have much of a form; I guess one has to iron it to get the shape shown in the picture. I personally don't find it flattering on me.
3.0,So far I like it. The blue pin remover broke first time I tried it. Everything else in the kit works just fine.
3.0,I ordered a couple of sizes up from my usual Xl and it fit about like a large. Other than that it’s a nice shirt.
3.0,"after a week the front cover is cracked, fit perfect but the material is very sensitive, I think he cheapest are better quality"
3.0,"was good for a while, began to change colors and both of ours broke"
3.0,"I ordered big, because it was coming from China.  I would have done better to order my regular size.  Too many clasps (3), they come undone."
3.0,"My husband wears large. This hat isn't large. It fits me! Too bad--it's a great looking hat. Not a Prime item so will have to keep.  Should have converted the 59 cm inches before buying--that's only 22 1/4"" so be aware."
3.0,Liked it but waist was too small
3.0,"I've read the reviews and for the price decided to take a chance.  It is made of some sort of cheaper metal, nothing precious.  So my daughter could only wear it after we coated it with clear nail polish (the earring stud) to keep my ear from turning red after about half an hour.  It fits okay and stayed on well enough as I am not an active person.  I work in an office.  The description is very sparse and by the picture it makes it look like you might get a box for it but you don't.  It came in an envelope an the earring stud part was bent when I got it.  I took a chance and slowly bent it back into a straight position and luckily though I could see where it might break in the future it hasn't yet.  I re-enforced it with some super glue.  It looks great for cheap costume jewelry and it did come quickly enough from out of the U.S. so for the price it's up to you to take a chance on it.  All and all I'm Okay with it."
3.0,Nice but veryyy small!!!
3.0,Sizing runs small & shrinks in dryer
3.0,"It's a good sweatshirt. I was looking for something soft, not the usual sweatshirt. THIS is the typical sweatshirt. Also it's is way way brighter orange than it looks in this photo. It's a neon orange/tangerine. I thought this would be good for football games, but it looks more like a contruction worker's safety vest color."
3.0,"I'm only giving it 3 stars because the package was damaged and it damaged the. Ard this is gifted in. Other than that, beautiful necklace"
3.0,One earring wouldn't clasp
3.0,I returned this item as it was too large.
3.0,The shirt was cute but it ran very small.
3.0,Not my type of style! But overall great craftsmanship!
3.0,The top layers are great. The lining has no stretch and turns into a mini skirt when I sit down.
3.0,"...but you won't if you buy your actual size. They are huge. And they will only get bigger. They were slightly large when they arrived. I now can't wear them without them sliding off my feet. I even washed them and threw them in the dryer hoping they'd shrink. Alas. No such luck. They are now unwearable.<br /><br />It's a shame. They're warm, comfortable, soft, and have nice soles. But they are gigantic."
3.0,"I am 5'4"", so is my 13 yr old son. I weigh 115 lbs, he weighs 90something. We also have an oval face shape. We deemed these masks a bit on the big side. Barely wearable, but not small enough to be comfortable in fit. My 17 yr old hasn't tried them on yet, but I think they will probably fit him (139 lbs, 5'8"") and my husband (165 lbs, 5'10"") because their faces are more wide. Like other reviewers have stated, there are no slots for filters. These would probably be ok for wearing to the store, or in a small social setting, but not in a packed classroom, for which I bought them. So, the search continues. We have also ordered the Weddingstar, adult sizes, so we'll see how those compare. For people who are saying that these are too small...wow. Folks, the mask just needs to cover your mouth and nose and just go under your chin to stay put. It shouldn't go all the way to your neck and ears. Goodness."
3.0,Somewhat small tight to get up but if I ordered bigger it may have fit a lot better<br />Not much stretch either socheck your size well
3.0,quality is nice but the fit is a little snug due to the elastic fit.
3.0,"Not as large nor as strong as they appear in photos.  However, they are very convenient and do hold a fair amount of groceries."
3.0,Not as i expected
3.0,"I really liked the pattern!! However, the gown was a cheese cloth texture. It was not soft at all or comfy! It fits very to tight.. Very disappointing!! Would not reccomend this gown.."
3.0,"Zipper malfunction, it doesn't stay closed."
3.0,Would have loved this but it's too small!!  Please make a larger version.
3.0,I really like the looks of these.. But the posts are like an inch long.. They poke into my head and are pretty uncomfortable to wear..
3.0,Love the belt design...could be a bit sturdier ( losing eyelets)..
3.0,the pair I got was missing the nose guard on one side 😩
3.0,"Fits large and fabric is too thin. Color is stunning, but I don't plan on buying this brand again. Dissatisfying product for the price."
3.0,"I bought an XL, but it was a little to big and too long. Not flattering at all. Im 5'6<br />waist - 37"", hip 48"", bust 45"""
3.0,"While this a pretty little necklace, it is too small for most women to wear.  I will be sending it to my little great niece to wear."
3.0,"The grey pair had a hole in them, had to return them. the elastic band seemed a little misplaced, it was too close to my ankle area."
3.0,Not as high quality as I thought it would be. I should have spent more and gone with a VTAC. It is however still perfectly functional.
3.0,"These glasses definitely are mirror reflecting glasses, but the color that i had choose, silver, is a bit childish looking."
3.0,It was a little small for an X-large if it would of been a 2XL it would of fit better
3.0,"This is very cute, but it has plastic button closures and it is pretty thin."
3.0,It was a little wider than the screen for my watch.
3.0,"Everything is good. Nice structure, good for active handling. The only problem I had was the fall-off  of the strap at one end after several months. Fortunately, I brought it to the shoe repair and spent 10 dollars for tight stitches. Now it's restored in the glamour."
3.0,"The shirt was exactly what I wanted m - soft, lightweight, and comfortable. longer torso is great too. However I ordered white and it is off-white. I went back to check my order to make sure I did not order the wrong color, and I did not. It’s a great shirt but the white is naturally white"
3.0,I really like them but they slide around my feet so a bit big for me.
3.0,Beautiful charm.  Picture apeares purple but charm is two colors: purple and light lavender.
3.0,"It looks like it should work, but $30 for one inflatable bag? Why so much, and why is it needed? In my experience, a sturdy container (good size plastic box, or sturdy cardboard box) and a nice and fluffy towel wrapped around the bottle will do the trick. I have done it on dozens of international flights and never had a problem."
3.0,zipper broke after daughter wore it barely a month
3.0,Very  Unproportional the material is very thin and see-through
3.0,"super cute but i thought it was for little girls---it is not, it is adult size"
3.0,Pretty but smells weird like chemicals
3.0,"As much as I like this lanyard's construction and materials, the breakaway on the lanyard should be before the adjustment button; it's current placement after the adjustment button makes the breakaway ineffective and overall a safety concern."
3.0,Floats
3.0,"They are cute, but they fall apart the first time they are used, I was able to fix them, but that tells you everything about their quality"
3.0,10 uses in and overall the product has worked well. Materials are robust and elastics/clips appear are holding up well.<br /><br />One disappointing feature is the oval ring used on the band portion that goes around the legs. The ring is too wide and allows the elastic to bunch up and twist rather than holding it straight.
3.0,it was good purchase but  over priced in my opinion materials are not that great it could cost $19.99 or less but no $29.99
3.0,"Definitely doesn't look anywhere as good on me as it does on the model, of course!  This looks and feels like a really cheap sweater, cheap material that's stiff and unflattering.  It does run oversized but doesn't look cute, it looks like you're wearing someone's hand me down sweater that's 3 sizes too big.  Just a no for me overall."
3.0,It was ok… more like a long wide t shirt. Not very flattering
3.0,Takes a while to get used to. Do not give up. I searched through youtube to find out how to do correctly. Works even in my 6 years old hair.
3.0,I ended up sending this dress back because the top portion fit awkwardly and the dress overall wasn't what I expected.
3.0,The socks are nice. The material is a little thin though. I had to return them because they are smaller than described.
3.0,"Second time ordering this brand of progressive glasses. This time, just like last time, they came in a nice case and undamaged. I take them out to discover a few problems. 1. The closest view (on the bottom) is blurry. 2. These things are huge! I mean like, in the photo I sent there's a comparison of the lense of an average size lense and its much smaller. 3. The case is actually better quality than the product. 4. Even though they were only $10 bucks you'd think they'd at least be worth it? Nope. Wasted time waiting for delivery yet again."
3.0,"I ordered the nightgown but received a short sleeved shirt and short pajama set instead. The pajama set is in grey and has mustard yellow trim around the edges. The pajama set reminded me of the clothes they give you to wear at Korean Saunas. The fabric material is not too soft and relatviely thin, but it's comfortable enough to wear.<br /><br />I originally ordered a size Small for the nightgown but the pajama set was in size Large. The fit was actually perfect so I assume their Large might have been children's size or maybe misprinted. I am 5'-8"" and 125lb for size reference."
3.0,Cute but very short. Barely hits below my butt.
3.0,cheap fabric. skimpy cut
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars due to the fact that i ordered it my size and it is at least 1 full size too small. I gave it to a friend and it looks great on her. If I where to order again, I would order at least 1 size larger than normal.  The look is beautiful on my small friend."
3.0,"Love the shoes and wish I had known about this brand when my older daughter was a baby. However, after just a couple of wears, the velcro does not stay stuck. I'm not sure if this is typical but its disappointing because I had planned on buying more Momo's. Not sure if its worth it. I am constantly fixing them."
3.0,The tennis is good but came in the wrong size!
3.0,Does not fit like on the model. Not very shaped. Will try with a belt.
3.0,For the most part it is quality. I wish it came with more support. I am a double D and need that support. Other than that it is super cute
3.0,"Don't fit like my other Jordan's, but I don't wear them that often. They look amazing!"
3.0,Too much material from the waist down
3.0,I should have ordered a size up. They are a little tight.
3.0,Not supportive enough to wear alone. Or size down.
3.0,"For this ukulele strap I did not like it very much. I actually returned it. The scarf material feels amazing on my neck but the length of it is terrible. It is too long for me. I even tried to tie it in a knot ,but it was still too long. Over all if the length was not so long I would have kept it."
3.0,The bottom cut of the shirt doesn’t compliment me
3.0,I know it's Asian sizing but there was no chance in he$$ that this dress would fit over my larger chest. It wasn't even close. Busty girls beware. The dress is beautiful in person though
3.0,After I got this bracelet I just felt it was very cheap looking so I don't wear it.
3.0,"So far I'm not that happy as the bracelet has fallen off three or four times. I would recommend a chain safety put on as to not lose it. As far as if the stones will stay sparkly, only time will tell."
3.0,lost there shape after the first wash. I only wear them under other shirts so not a real big deal for me.
3.0,Very cute dress but humanly impossible to bend over in this. its right under your butt. Also itchy.
3.0,"The first one of these -- same brand -- I bought (over a year ago) had a poor quality zipper that caught a lot and finally broke. I liked the size of it, so I gave the company/brand another shot. This one is lovely, with nice zippers and I am pleased with it."
3.0,"Overall, a good option for women who travel with lots of beauty products and want to stay organized.<br /><br />Here are the pros and cons:<br /><br />Good:<br />- Folds nicely. Very compact and convenient.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Items you want to place in the pockets must be fairly flat to fit.<br />- The travel organizers arrive with a funny, chemical smell. Order several days before you need to use them so you can air them out first!"
3.0,This shirt looks like it could have been cute but they sent me two sizes too small. I've returned it and it was very easy to return but I didn't bother ordering again
3.0,narrow....so if you have a wide foot...order a slide with a velcro adjustment.
3.0,The slides are a bit wide and a little bigger then my normal size.
3.0,Fabric quality is very bad. You can not wear it in winter. I gave three  stars because the design is so cute.
3.0,Very cute shoe but very narrow. Not for wide feet. Had to return.
3.0,Some what to small don't like the way the bottom fits.
3.0,"Didn’t like how it feels on,not too bad,but you can wear it around the house."
3.0,The legs were super wide compared to other boot cut jeans and the fit up too was weird.
3.0,White stitching shows on mask front. Mask on post does not show white stitching...it makes it look cheap and tacky. Should sent product as advertised.
3.0,"To small in the shoulders, had to give it away. Otherwise, it appeared to be a great workout shirt."
3.0,"I really like these belts, however the sizing leaves a lot to be desired.<br />I tried 3 different sizes and none of them worked for me. The XL which is what I usually get belts in is WAY too big - Had to return!<br />The L which I thought would work was also too big. When tightened it left a very long tail which looks STUPID! Had to return!<br />The M was my next try. Well this one is too small! Can't win I guess. Had to return!<br />Thanks for the return policy though, that went flawlessly!<br />I'll have to look for another brand!"
3.0,"I am 5'3"" and weigh 125lbs usually wear a small sometimes medium depending on the outfit. This fit great until you looked from the side, then I looked pregnant with how the fabric hung on me. Returned it but loved the colors."
3.0,"Look good, but too big for my 3 yrs hands"
3.0,The ring I got in the mail wasn't  nearly as pretty as the ring in this picture. It's not a bad ring.
3.0,Dress is so cute and fits great but has had these weird white spots on the top of it both times they've sent it too me. Like it enough to try one more time but their quality control must be very poor! I see it's showing up with these weird spots on one of the advertised pics now. What the??? It's definitely a flaw not part of a design! Three strikes you're out!
3.0,wanted to love it but it did not look the same in photos
3.0,"Decent wind jacket, but runs small got an xxl and it just fits over a sweatshirt, I wanted it larger to fit over gear. Water soaks right in, maybe if it's misting it might resist but not for long."
3.0,Cute bag texture is different then expected
3.0,Too tight and long
3.0,This dress is an oddly thick material. I ordered the black and flowers one and with the slightest stretch it would start turning white which may be a sign of cheap material. It was also very unflattering in me unfortunately. Was able to return with no difficulties
3.0,"These shoes are very cute, the colors are bright and cute style. But they are big and wide. My daughter’s foot was swimming in these shoes so we will have to return them. I thought about saving them for next summer but they are too wide for her foot."
3.0,"Thin cotton material and loose woven back side with cross threads coming loose. Purchased on for him and one for me, no issue with his, only mine and only in the sleeves... which get caught on things...also, falsely states it is flannel, which it is NOT. More a coarse thin cotton that softens a bit with washing."
3.0,"&#34;Ear Cuffs require no piercings. The Climbing Cat Ear Cuff will easily fit most left ears and is guaranteed to delight!&#34;<br /><br />I was under the impression that this ear cuff required no piercings because the description said so. When it arrived, it very clearly has a piercing needle/apparatus (I have no idea what to call it, I clearly don't have pierced ears). The cuff part is higher up. I figure i'll just cut off the little metal piercing thing and it should work okay as an ear cuff.<br /><br />It did arrive in a cute little box though!"
3.0,"FROM THE LABEL: 100% acrylic; Made in China; cool water; do not tumble dry; do not bleach; iron up to 110C max<br />Approx measurements (laying flat):<br />Total length: 35-1/2” from collar to bottom<br />Sleeve length from top of collar to bottom of sleeve: 28-1/2”<br />Sleeve length from dropped shoulder seam to bottom of sleeve: 18”<br />Width: 21”<br /><br />Design wise, it’s cute and it reminds me of something I would have bought in the 80s at Esprit. Quality wise, um no. It looks, feels, and reads pretty cheap.  I was expecting it to be thin, you can easily see how sheer it is just from the online images, but it’s ok as I was looking for something very lightweight. However, the ‘scent’ and chemical treatment that often plagues garments of this ilk was so intense it made my skin react. After I tried it on—on bare skin which was a huge mistake—I was literally burning in every spot it touched. Pretty sad state of affairs that you have to wash these fast fashion imports just to try them on for 45 seconds?! Ugh.<br /><br />I laundered it in a delicates bag, in cold, on the gentlest cycle of my machine. No dryer of course. The washing was so gentle that it didn’t even relax the deep creases from being folded in a small bag…but yet it’s already got a slight case of the ‘fuzzies’.  So I can’t see this being able to hold up long through multiple washings. Also, the seams are wonky and thick; these uneven and bumpy seams are quite visible from just about every exterior angle. See pic.<br /><br />Fit wise, I ordered in XL; I’m 5’5”, 44 bust, heavy in the middle and more narrow in the hips. This hits me at mid thigh. The sleeves, on my frame, aren’t comically long and the upper arm space is roomy but not super baggy.  Overall I’d say it should accommodate most figures up to about 18-20-ish? Though remember it’s so see-through (and bright white) that there’s no ‘hiding’ anything. If you’re not plus sized but like an oversized look, I wouldn’t automatically order up. Most Asian apparel runs very small but this is more TTS.<br /><br />I purchased this because I’m a sucker for stripes and prefer pockets in my slouchy cardis. But ultimately this is more of a beach coverup for light use than true streetwear. I like the colors and the design so I’m giving it more stars than I should, but feel guilty buying such disposable clothing."
3.0,The dress is cute but I had to adjust the straps in the back. They were way to long. There is also a desent amount of side boob.
3.0,"Looks to be made of quality  fabric. However, the size chart depicts erroneous sizes. An XL fits more like a medium."
3.0,Not as helpful as I would like.
3.0,"I was really hoping I would like these stainless steel round cut black cubic zirconia stud earrings by Regatta Jewelry just as much as I liked the clear colored ones I got from them. However, though they're made with stainless steel I'm not sure what exactly the black part is that is covering the stainless steel. These earrings seem to irritate my ears a bit leaving crusty material from my ears. I did not have this issue with the other stainless steel steel earrings by Regetta jewelry, which is what leads me to believe the black is what is irritating my ears. Also I noticed that where the push back of the earring clips on it seems to be chipping the black off of the post. They are very nice looking jewelry earrings, and seem to be well made, and the jewel seems very secure. They are not too large so they're not too gaudy looking and I could easily wear them in the second hole of my ear. I really like the look of the black jewel, I just wish that it had had &#34;silver&#34; color of stainless steel with the black jewel as I feel they probably would not irritate my ears like these black coated ones do. They look very nice but they're just not for me. I receive this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />&#60;3 Thanx"
3.0,Hardly fits my face. More for a kid.
3.0,"I was thinking wearing this would look like the image.  I have about that type of body.  I am 5'4 104 pounds.  I ordered the small.  Maybe I would have fit in an xsmall or xxsmall if they made them. Anyways,  the top fits perfect but it would for anyone .There's not a seam under ruffles for boob support, it just goes straight down . This dress is going to look awesome though when I am pregnant! Lol I wouldnt get this dress if you are petite.  Maybe a size small is for someone around 125.the fabric is nice and soft though.  Second dress I've ordered from Amazon with this fabric, it's nice but they both fit my body the same."
3.0,They are cute but way smaller then i thought they would be for the size i picked.
3.0,Missing backs.
3.0,I have to admit that I didn't get to test this out properly because my dogs thought they were chew toys.
3.0,It’s ok.  Very warm but not really flattering
3.0,Fabric is nice but not sized to fit.  Ordered an XL. And it fit like a M-L
3.0,"It's ok. The white stripes aren't true white, more of a creamier color white so when paired with a true white top it looks dingy. Also not as long as the picture and the slits are oddly placed. Cute but not super impressed."
3.0,These are cute and my daughter was so excited to get them but they run small even even using the size chart. So now my daughter wants to keep them even though her toes are at the very tip and I can't even return them for a bigger size because we got the biggest size. So she'll probably only get to wear them a few times
3.0,"I like the idea of the dress; but it’s HUGE. I ordered a small and I’m swimming in it. I’d order an xsmall, but they do not have that option 😕. I will try to see if it will work with a belt, but if not I will have to return"
3.0,"legs were 8&#34; too long. My daughter is very tall, so I will give them to her"
3.0,My husband likes them but they all are crooked
3.0,"What I liked: the style, color, feel of fabric- that on linen. What I didn’t: see through. It’s very light and I could see my undies either back or nude. Also, the size. I ordered a large and it was huge and shapeless. It’s good as a beach dress tho. I sent it back."
3.0,"Ordered pink because it was free returns so I wanted to see before committing to a different one. The pink is completely see through. The black I was going to try will take over a month to arrive and not free returns. So, it’s a bust. I wouldn’t order again. If you do, it’s a solid size too big"
3.0,Very nice leggings I would've rated them 5 stars besides the high chemical scent but what I really hated is that after 2 weeks of worn the inside (leg ) below the cratch torn. Material isn't good or maybe defective
3.0,"Great quality screen print. T shirt is a bit on the stiff side, would have liked a softer more vintage feel. Have worn and washed several times and logo still looks awesome."
3.0,"I had high hopes, but I should have trusted my gut. Fits as advertised, and really does match the description... but looks super cheap, more of a pajama top than an actual blouse I’d wear out of the house."
3.0,"Wasent wide enough to get foot in. Very tight , other than that they were great. Bought my normal shoe size."
3.0,Nice but the arms fit funny
3.0,"It is very soft, it kight be good but not always , because doesnt look fit on you and i didn't like the neck cut much! I use it inside sweaters or shirts as first layer! Doesnt look fit as is."
3.0,"Runs small, zipper is already broken, material is cheap"
3.0,the toe area is a bit narrow but it opens up closer to the top but that creates a huge gap at the ankle that rubs you raw but the look cute
3.0,Looks kinda cool yet low grade product. This is not a deal and I would expect to pay 10 dollars for this product.
3.0,Runs very small. Size up 2 sizes
3.0,The quality was fine for a costume but the skirt was tiny and didn’t fit the described sizes. Don’t recommend for anyone above size 4-6 women’s.
3.0,It was a little small so it didn't fit right!
3.0,"Ordered and returned. Not a fan of the material at all. Very flimsy and thin.. stretchy and shiny. Looks like a beach sarong. Had intended this for salsa dancing and the side slit is about 3 inches too high to be able to move without flashing someone, as well :/. Bummer."
3.0,"These were a gift for my daughter. They were pretty, matches the picture shown."
3.0,My item does not come with pouch or warranty card like the other i bought
3.0,"This ring is very pretty. The abalone inlay is subtle but looks really nice, and each one is unique. The quality of the ring is not great. I'm not sure if the metal is not pure or what, but it is super soft and bends really easily. Because of this, it is very easy to adjust the size of the ring if you are between sizes or your size is not available. I measured my finger to be a size 10 (which was not available) but ordered a 9 and it fits great. I like the thickness and width of the ring and like that it is smooth and won't get caught on things, but I wish the material was less malleable. I don't think it will hold a nice round shape for long."
3.0,"The idea behind this is great; however, I find it moves around in my mask.  It has hooks on each end to attach to your mask but I found that most masks don't accommodate the hooks.  When worn it does serve the purpose of keeping the mask free of your mouth making breathing and talking easier but unless you can hook it-it moves around."
3.0,The charm is great but the necklace broke with a very small tug!  I was anle to fix it but next time I hope my necklace is a lot stronger...
3.0,Not quite what I expected. A soft polyester with a snug fit.
3.0,"Basically fine, but find the collar a bit weird.  It seems too thin and too large in diameter, almost as though it were designed for women or something.  Unisexual?!"
3.0,they shrunk in the wash.....
3.0,"The package came in good condition, but when opened the there was noticeable damage to the glass case. The glass case is misaligned, markes that look like pin marks or claw points, sides are rubbed away in spots, and the inside back part is bent and coming off. Positive, the glasses are great and daughter loves them! No scratches or anything to ruin the glasses... odd as the two came attached."
3.0,Clasp bar uncomfortable-round type more comfortable- instead of flat blade like bar. Otherwise good color and appearance..would not buy again unless bar changes.
3.0,The fit and material reveals any all lumps and  bumps … :).  I’m a size 14. Ordered a large. Too close fit. Wearing  it with PJs. That works.
3.0,Not the best fit. it's cute but it is made very cheap.
3.0,Item as expected!!!
3.0,The case was broken but the watch was not broken.  It is a birthday gift for my niece.
3.0,"Really thin, it feels like it won't last long."
3.0,"My advice would be order 1-size smaller than what you usually wear - these seem to strech out as the leather absorbs water or sweat. They just feel like they're gonna slip right off my feet, I only wear them around the house."
3.0,first time use and broke.
3.0,"Girlfriend loved how it looked, but it was starting to make her break out. Not for those with sensitive skin."
3.0,They are just ok. They interfere with the touchscreen if they get wet at all.
3.0,Would buy second set but little pricey
3.0,"Dress is absolutely adorable, but as I am long wasted it fits more Empire and does not come down as low in the back as pictured... if I try to make it come down that low by tying the lace loser then there is too much exposure all the way around as the dress is held together by only two Thin rope ties - 1 of the neck, and one at the waist / lower back. I ordered a small and it fits just like a small according to measurements.<br />Dress is very forgiving an adaptable as far as adjusting so people with larger busts I should probably go with a medium and with proper adjustment of ties you will get the coverage you need and the rest of the dress will still fit as a small.<br />Also, I am five foot seven and the dress shows very very short in the pictures but is just about an inch above the knees on me. With a little bit of tweaking on my end I think it will become one of my favorite summer dresses :)"
3.0,The cut of these with the real tight calf and fit are not particularly comfortable.
3.0,Everyone likes it. But not me...
3.0,worked good for what I needed
3.0,Really cute but runs at least one size to small maybe even two sizes
3.0,Not spandex no compression
3.0,"Great bag with plenty of room, unfortunately, one of the two main zippers broke and I had to remove that zipper with pliers.<br />*Edit: Knocking it down to 3 stars, after some time I learned the zippers are horrible, all of them eventually stopped working and either jam up or come off altogether. So I know have a decent bag that I cannot zip up so it is useless outside of the house."
3.0,Very stiff and hard to get on the tie. A clip or a more flexible metal would be better.
3.0,The waist of the shorts is super high.  If you have a high waste then okay but if you like things to sit just below good luck.  Plus the shorts are very long on me almost like a bermudas.
3.0,"It is a lovely design but gets dirty easily with outdoor play!  As my 3 year old is slight fleshy in her feet, it is also rather tight and was painful the 1st few times she wore the flip flop. Needs time to break into it but it is also wearing out and about time to throw out after the breaking in!"
3.0,"It is a cute bracelet, but much smaller than I thought it was going to be. The straps are much narrower, beads smaller. If I had been shopping in a store, it would not have caught my attention, and I wouldn't have purchased."
3.0,First they smell god awful but that fades in a few weeks.  They are uncomfortable as any Sandal I’ve ever put on.  These are true shower sandals and not made for walking.  For the price they work.
3.0,Cheap and glue everywhere
3.0,"These are actually a lovely color and length.  I pulled the drawstring out, because I need no added belly material.  The waist band is not really flattering, but not thick and bunchy enough to make these unworkable with normal tops.  I thought they would be more denim like; they are a thin, silky material, which I think will work fine if I let go of the denim idea.  Drawstring is easy to remove"
3.0,they are extremely heavy. they tend to leave an imprint on your face.<br /><br />They tend to slide off. they need rubber on the side arms
3.0,"Nice looking flip-flop, but the shoe hurt my wife's feet, so had to return them."
3.0,Actually it good but for me it’s loose.
3.0,It's very pretty but does not stay tight on your wrist and continues to loosen as you move your hand.
3.0,Nice dress. It was a little small so my daughter is enjoying it.
3.0,"Nice pretty necklace, small for.what we were expecting but otherwise great!"
3.0,"Arrived beautifully packaged. Good quality. Included pendant and chain in a nice box, velvet bag for storage and a polishing cloth. Only issue I have is that I ordered the silver 3 triangles and received black circle, square, triangle. I decided to not deal with returning/reordering/waiting. It is not what I picked but still nice."
3.0,"I bought these shirts expecting them to be a dryfit fabric that keeps you warm when you're cold and cold when you're warm, but these shirts just retain all of your heat no matter what. There were times where I was completely drenched in sweat just walking around the airport from the shear heat that these retain. If you're going out in the winter when it's below 30 degrees F they would be great, but I was wearing them in 40 degree weather and it was still way too warm for me."
3.0,Goggles fit my hear but the strap is ok but the goggles are to small.  Look funny.  Probably ok for a child.
3.0,"Could fit a little better, a bit too loose in the bodice."
3.0,Both ends unscrew. Liked the variety. Not very good quality. Does not stay screwed tightly.
3.0,Crushed during shipment. Not the quality I expected. Brim never did recover.  Should have sent it back.
3.0,Face does not look as described.
3.0,Love it but didn’t last through summer
3.0,Just ended up being too large for me
3.0,Doesn't look like the picture but is very fresh material..
3.0,When we first received this it was good but after the first couple uses it started to tear by the zipper. Not impressed with the quality. Overall the product worked just the minor imperfection.
3.0,This isn't a sweater - it's a sweatshirt designed to look like a sweater.  A bit snug.
3.0,"I got the xs and it probably woukd fit a 5 or 6 year old. My daughter wore it as a sleep shirt twice, we washed it and now it has a hole in the left side. Really disappointed. It's a sleep shirt for us and we'll keep using it but the,quality of workmanship leaves a lot to be desired."
3.0,It fit weird on me
3.0,"I ordered it on a Thursday night and it arrived, with one-day service, on Wednesday!  Apparently it all sat in a service center two towns away for a couple days while the USPS had to figure out how to get it to another service center 2 towns away in a different direction to deliver to me.<br />This is not the first time this happened.  It seems to be a common occurrence and I would recommend getting someone else, other than USPS to deliver items in order to actually have one-day service."
3.0,Dress is cute. Fits nicely and the material is soft.<br />The neckline is a little off. It isn't hemmed and just lays a little weird. It's not bunchy enough to be a slouch neck but there's too much fabric for it to lay smooth. I got a good deal on it and I am happy with it but if I had tried it on in the store I probably wouldn't have bought it.
3.0,Strap too big needed to alter just to wear.
3.0,I normally wear a medium. I ordered a large this last time. It's still kind of tight. But I really love it.
3.0,These are very heavy and way too dark to wear unless you are arc welding. They do look cool and sturdy.
3.0,Super cute and love the non- breakable concept but arms were so flexible they wont stay on- too flimy and or wide for my 7 year old daughter.
3.0,The hats really nice but the gold triangle thing is ugly and the hat would have been 5 stars without it and when yo remove it(a few screws) it leaves large holes in the hat
3.0,They are really soft but they do not stretch so much. I recommend looking for one that have more cotton and some spandex so they stretch. I bought some FOL breathable underwear that are 91%cotton 5% polyester and 4% Spandex. They are perfect.
3.0,Front is sewn shut.  Needs an opening.
3.0,It fit right but had a GOD AWFUL ODOR.
3.0,"The fabric and design are ok, but the size is too small. I knew about the small sizing so I went for a XL when Im always M, but still didn't fit."
3.0,"I ordered the size recommended by the size chart.  It's on the small side, I'd wished I would have ordered it larger.  The material isn't very stretchy, so there's no margin for error.  This would look cuter on me if it were a little loose.  Cute though.... just too snug."
3.0,"It was cute and dainty… but the rocks were kind of jagged. It was too poky for me, so i gave it to my daughter as a gift."
3.0,"Ok ladies for your ladies-if you are looking for great support without implants this one will fit the bill.  However the double sets of hooks in the back are a pain to get together unless your bra is too loose-the top set is high up your back.  Otherwise it works fine.  That said-if you have implants and/or lift as I did this bra won't work.  The gaps around the middle is too loose between the breasts-my surgeon said nope.  There's another Syrokan one I bought to try has a solid grey band and is perfect!  (SYROKAN Women's High Impact Support Bounce Control Plus Size Workout Sports Bra)-Wide angled in straps-triple hooks, snug between the breast-perfect said my surgeon (who preferred his patients used victoria Secrets VSX sports bra), so score!  Anyway-for non implant ladies-great, non implant use the other one! (SYROKAN Women's High Impact Support Bounce Control Plus Size Workout Sports Bra),  I hope this helps you!"
3.0,"Sweatshirt fits great, and color is as pictured. Unfortunately, after a few washings the fabric is becoming nappy. Should be better quality for the price."
3.0,After one wash the rhinestones fell off the shorts. I was disappointment. She had only worn them once.
3.0,"Cute dress but super small,  I wear a XL.  I bought a XXL.  Looks like a medium at best"
3.0,Only got one out of three
3.0,Run small..
3.0,Did not like that the baffles were sewn through---over price like most down jackets---if the baffles are sewn through air gets in --- does not really keep you warm---needs solid interior lining like they use to do 15 years ago--Item was returned
3.0,Read the one star review that states they didn’t purchase this product but is mad that they state how these pants can possibly make you seem thinner in certain areas. First of all that’s why I read the reviews to see if they are a good product and possibly help me seem slimmer in areas I have an issue working out. I will be purchasing a pair and will update on them.
3.0,Loved the mask but the cat print wasnt in center of mask off alittle but noticeable.
3.0,"I was giving this product as a gift and it is worth it to note that the packaging came a little beat up, which is less than ideal for a gift, but a good product overall."
3.0,Way to big. Runs huge
3.0,"Stylish, but pretty complicated to figure all functions out on this watch.  East coast (NY) time is inaccurate, and I have it on another country which matches what my time zone should be."
3.0,I like the product but if you did not put away properly it would get dangled.
3.0,Cute but the straps are too wide so it bulges out around the arm holders and neck. Ended tucking it in my sports bra to get it to fit right.
3.0,No curves shown and the material is on the thin side
3.0,"I was a little bummed out that this didn’t fit. It fits too small for the sizing listed. Other than that, it looks super cute, and would probably look really cute on someone not larger than a size large (again, order up)."
3.0,The seller was great and the item was as advertised but it was a bit small.  I should have gotten a size up.
3.0,I like the shirt just need to come in a bigger size
3.0,"they don't look very great in my ears, they rest really weird and it's hard to tell they are spiders. But they are sturdy and seem well made. I still wore them for a night and they didn't bother my ears at all."
3.0,"I got other pajamas in this brand and they fit perfectly. While this set fit, I didn’t like the fit as much because the top feels smaller but it’s still comfy, just doesn’t fit looser like the models top. The shorts have ruffles and tend to ride up too, and pockets that hang out, but they are cute just not my favorite ones."
3.0,Tight on the for head
3.0,"Very pretty, but hard to keep the roll-down part in place. Kept rolling back up to cover my shoulders throughout the night. May experiment with safety pins or something."
3.0,"it is a good looking shirt problem is the sizes run small I purchased a 3X and it's more like a 2X I bought a 2X for my son for Christmas guess i'll have to give him mine and give my grandson his, not a bad product at all but the sizes run small."
3.0,it was longer than expected. there should be someway to check how this would look on petite women.
3.0,"I love thenlooknof these, they are unique and beautiful. However very painful to wear as the holes don't align in one of the earrings. It's like a pinching sensation while wearing them."
3.0,"These are cute and soft inside. Unfortunately, they don't work for my daughter. First off, they are very wide. The sizing is also inadequate. My daughter wears a size 11 - 11.5 and these are enormous. Perhaps they fit a 13 but they don't fit a 10, 11, or 11.5 foot. As you can see there isn't any elastic to accommodate a change in foot size, so they'll only fit when your kiddo's size is spot on. I personally am disappointed, so is my daughter."
3.0,Product was nice but ran small he will be able to wear them for only a few weeks probably
3.0,"The cream color is so close to the white color, you can barely tell it’s not white."
3.0,There is no give at all.  Too tight on me and I ordered larger then normal.
3.0,Very stiff and a little too large
3.0,Looks good but cheap made
3.0,The reason to buy it: low price. The reason to say it not so impressive: 1. too tight; 2. no enough elasticity; 3. limited ability to absorb sweat.
3.0,They can hurt your get until you get used to them.  Start slow.
3.0,…the band is shorter than the ones from other manufacturers.
3.0,I love the size and design but one was broken when they arrived. Makes me worry another will break then I'll have to look for a different set.
3.0,"I ordered these in the 10 mm size. They are bright, shiny, sturdy and very heavy. I love the look of them, but I'm going to order a 7 mm so that I can stand wearing them all day."
3.0,A unique type of fit I would Say order like one size up even if you have a 35lb child the largest size is too tight to put over any pant
3.0,Not for small chested. Returned
3.0,This was a gift and it was also very beautifully made
3.0,A little short for what I expected so can’t wear to work but cute and works for the price.
3.0,These are great for people like me who constantly lose their nose rings or have the gems fall out but the guage of the stem is a lot thinner than regular nose studs and it slips out and come out often. Great for the price though.
3.0,Super cute great clarity broke within a month
3.0,The material seemed to be a little cheap. Look cute though. Not sure how well they will hold up. It was a gift for my niece.
3.0,A bit bulky but overall a comfy chenille.
3.0,Took a long time to receive. Way smaller then I was expecting. I ordered a red one that was supposed to be comparable and the red is twice the size.  And better quality fir same price.  Too expensive for what I got.
3.0,"I had to return - ordered the small but the bust did not fit at all and I can't imagine a larger size would fix the issue without drowning the rest of me.  If you are small all over I'm sure it's an adorable staple, I wish it fit!"
3.0,"Way too small. Nice fabric, tho."
3.0,"Frankly, this jacket just didn't cut it for Michigan Winter.  I'd recommend this jacket for temps around 50* and higher.  Add to that, the cut was bulky and square, no type of toggle in the middle to keep it fitted, and the square plackets don't lay right.  The size Small fit my size 6 frame perfectly, but I just didn't like how it looked on me."
3.0,It was more wide than long and that was a turn off. It is a nice shirt tho
3.0,Leaves lint EVERYWHERE!!!
3.0,"I thought I finally found the pefect leggings, until after only 3 washes and the zipper popped on the right hand side, now exposing my upper thighs. Because I liked the fit so much, I will order again. Hopefully they last."
3.0,The size was off. The socks were bigger than expected but for they still served its purpose. I recommend.
3.0,It’s a nice enough dress but the straps are not adjustable and gaped at the top. The straps should either have elastic and in them or be adjustable as everyone is not the same.
3.0,Looks great in a photograph
3.0,"The shape and style is exactly what I was looking for, but I'm very disappointed in the transition. It does not get very dark outside and does not lighten up very much inside. Overall, very disappointed."
3.0,"It is fine except a couple of the words' ink ran.  But other than that, it's fine.  I use them to clean in and lounge around."
3.0,It doesn’t look like the picture at all but it’s very cute the colors are all the way off. I received more pinkish purplish color not green. The outfit is very cute and sexy but if you’re top heavy you may wanna rethink this one. I’m a 40G and my breasts are very exposed.
3.0,It fit small.
3.0,Excellent material but they roll and become uncomfortable.  Amazing price.
3.0,"This jacket fit me well, and I got a lot of compliments on it... BUT... after only a week or so, the seams started coming apart. First on the sleeves/elbow area, then on the back/armpit area. Also, the fabric balls up quite a bit in the areas where there is friction like the sleeves, backside (from sitting), and the under arms, so it starts to look kind of ratty after not much wear. I still think it deserves 3 stars though because it's actually pretty heavy and kept me warm for the winter, it's a beautiful color, and the style/shape of it was perfect for my body type. Its just a shame that I probably won't be able to wear it next winter since it already looks worn out and torn :("
3.0,What would you expect from a $40 watch. Not that great but makes a decent gift to a couple. Looks good that’s all it matters
3.0,"Frumpy dress!  I’m 5’5”, It didn’t look great on me!  The little sleeve is nice to hide fat.  I think it would look better on someone taller.  Material is soft."
3.0,"This shirt was pretty enough, just the sizing was way off. Ordered 3-4 year old more for like a 8-9 year old."
3.0,Much more white in person than silver.  Love the clasp tho!
3.0,"Very nice and beautiful, heavy keychain, the light is super bright too.<br />Only complain I have is the tires as they fall off on your pockets every single time. And it seems that now after just few weeks, they are lose and most likely will end up misplacing them all.<br />Not sure why they decided to go with rubber tires since the whole thing is metal.<br />Not a problem if you are not planing on using the keychain as a a keychain, and just display on your wall or desk."
3.0,"Great shoes for the price, but way bigger than a US size one."
3.0,"I was excited to wear these...until my kid told me it looks like I took a poop in my pants.  In other words, they're very unflattering."
3.0,Really nice hat. Only problem is it came with a stain already on the front part of the hat.
3.0,"These are super cute witch hats, but definitely more youth size than adult. I don't have a large head by any means & they just barely sat on my head, not enough though that they would stay on with the weight of the top of the hat, it continually toppled off. I had to attach it to a head and to keep in place."
3.0,It's ok. I found one of the hook bent when u opened the package.
3.0,The length was much short than I wanted
3.0,Broke at the screw attachment area after about a week
3.0,"They fit a bit large. i'm 5'11&#34; 200 lbs, and the leggins fit a bit loose for my liking after the 4th wash."
3.0,You get what you pay for with this product
3.0,The band snags any shirt!
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, except part of it keeps twisting under so I find myself always having to adjust it."
3.0,My mom loved this
3.0,Was cute for the white party I needed it for. Cheap material though. Arm was tight.
3.0,"It's soft and lightweight. Here's the dilemma, the garment construction is great, it's well put together. But it's like it's made from cheap materials. For example, the elastic trim along the inside of top of the cup is very thin and it seems that with one wash or one particularly hot sweaty day and that's it. It fits fairly well and is very pretty, it's just that with 36H bossom, I need more support for everyday use."
3.0,"I am 5’10”, 138lbs and I wear a size 2 / xs / 26.  I bought these in a small and couldn’t close them around my high or mid waist.  Otherwise, they are cute!"
3.0,"You can see thru the cloth, so you better get a good bra. It was really nice but the deodorant or sweat created orange stains in the cloth so I stopped using it"
3.0,1 of 7 is with defect.
3.0,"The sizing was fine, it wasn’t as long as the picture makes it seem, fell JUST below the crotch. Was expecting it to come to at least mid thigh."
3.0,The necklace is really cute however the chain is very cheap quality. I plan to keep it but I will put it on a nicer chain.
3.0,Ordered size L....<br /><br />Run small then other CARHARTT product I have.<br />The main problem is that the shirt is very short in length.... Shoulders and sleeves are ok
3.0,"Great shorts, however, be careful when washing.  Best to hand wash separate as mine came out of the wash covered in pills.  I had to throw them away.  But, I liked them enough to buy another pair."
3.0,"This item did not meet my expectations at all, just enough to cover my head not my shoulders as I assumed by description shawl."
3.0,"There is very little support in these. If you are the lease bit &#34;full&#34; these are not going to help. If you need them for the small strap the are okay. I prefer the Coobie comfort bra with the wider straps for more support. I would not purchase again, however that has nothing to do with the quality, simply a personal choice."
3.0,"Rings are cheap but definitely worth the price! Don't bend them too far, one ring did break on me."
3.0,Very cute but the skirt is too big. Top fits perfect. Nicely made
3.0,"Really wanted this watch band to work out. Very attractive, comfortable and really easy to put on/off since it just slides over your hand, don't have to bother with buckle. Only thing is side buttons didn't make proper contact to Fitbit so unable to control watch. Tried numerous times to reseat Blaze in frame but still didn't work."
3.0,"It was great,, jus as described"
3.0,"This is a pretty nice watch with some caveats.<br /><br />The main issue is the bracelet, which, if not worn tightly, rattles like a toy on the wrist. I wear my bracelets loose, though. And, to be fair, a lot of automatic watches rattle as the rotor spins inside. This rattle, though from a different source (as it’s a quartz watch), isn’t any more annoying than that. In this case, the specific source of the rattling is at the end links, where the bracelet and the end links are not snug. When it rattles, it resonates through the case and produces a hollow metallic sound. When the bracelet is snug, the end links can’t rattle around loosely.<br /><br />Other than that rattling, the fit and finish is fairly good for the price. The quality of the bracelet is about the same as a Seiko 5. The clasp is stamped and there’s a single-sided, spring-loaded release button. The links themselves appear to be solid. The bracelet is comfortable, with no sharp edges.<br /><br />The case and bezel appear to be polished steel. The unsigned crown has no crown guards, but feels firm and solid, as do the chronograph pushers which also serve as crown guards here. The numerals appear to be printed and are not luminescent, but there are lume pips at every hour marker and on the hour and minute hands. As expected at this price point, the lume does not have the best longevity, losing its charge in an hour or so.<br /><br />The thing about this watch is it looks amazing. It’s really a handsome watch in person. Perfectly sized, great design, easy to read (for a chronograph) and quartz accuracy all come together to make this watch a treat. And, aside from the rattling, the fit and finish are good.<br /><br />If you plan to change the bracelet, or if you wear your watches fairly snug, I would recommend this watch. If you like to wear your bracelets a little loose, or have no intention of changing to a different strap, the rattling might be a deal breaker."
3.0,Light but lovely coat
3.0,It’s cute and warm but my daughter was complaining the bunny designs on the legs were scratchy on the inside of pants
3.0,"Not quite what I anticipated,, But not bad,"
3.0,I use this for my rook piercing and it hasn’t fallen out but it has cause annoying pain. I guess because of how it lays on my ear. I now have a bump on my outer ear  where the pointy part of the heart sits. Overall : not good for inner ear piercings but it does the job and hasn’t caused any infections.
3.0,"It is small, you might need to go 2 sizes up."
3.0,It's cute but very thin material.
3.0,"Love this shirt, very easy to wear everywhere. Only complaint is that the sleeves fit a bit tight around my bicep."
3.0,Was not the material i thought it was going to be made out of its not soft at all (that i can live with it thos stupid wire in the center it wont stay in place and its sharp
3.0,"Ordered these for my hubby but when they came my 14 yr old saw them & that was that. He wore them every day for about a week, put them in a softer-sided case, took them in the car & when we got where we were going he took them out to wear them & said they were broken. Not sure what happened to them but unless they were stepped on they should have held up longer than a week."
3.0,The size was large and quality isn't as expected
3.0,Nice bag to small for me sent it back
3.0,Lovely soft material but green is not as shown.  It is much more pale.
3.0,"Very thin sweater and not to my liking, personal preference is that my sweaters are heavy and warm.  I need to wear another sweater over it to be as warm as I like.  My daughter loved it and now it has a new owner.  I would say it is better suited for a younger person, not an older person.  It looks much better on her also, yes it fits a younger person much better."
3.0,it was good when i first started wearing it but the color fades faster than expected
3.0,"I like the print. But, I was disappointed that the print was only on one side of the scarf. The other side was white. But I am keeping it because it was pretty and very inexpensive."
3.0,"The shirt fit the way I would like in arms and across the shoulders.Not pleased with the length. I'm only 5'-3&#34; so if you are tall and want in to cover your midsection while doing daily activities don't buy this brand. Very soft material, will likely end up as a sleep shirt."
3.0,"Nice shirt, light weight comfortable except for the sleeves.  They are too tight. I bought a large for comfort so the sleeves should have been fine but they are not."
3.0,Shorts are decent but very small
3.0,"Their previous Playdry material was better, more comfortable.<br />These, The collar is too small and bunches, the fabric stays dry great, but is more plastic feeling than fabric feeling, less comfortable."
3.0,I expected the emblem to be white. Its actually gray. So thats unexpected. But the sweatshirt is quality so he will deal with it. just disappointed that it didnt look like it did in the photo
3.0,"The shirt fit, but the style is really boxy - not a flattering fit."
3.0,This would be so much cuter if it wasn't see through. I love the design and color. The fabric is nice and soft but there's not hiding anything under this dress. Hope you're comfortable with a nude thong and nipple stickies otherwise everyone will see your underwear and other assets crystal clear.
3.0,"Good quality, butnthenshirt ran small.. Like skin tight"
3.0,"Fits okay, a little too big and you can’t adjust it but very cute design and fun to wear."
3.0,Had to send them back... they were really big with huge pockets
3.0,"Decent shirt for the price and love the saying. A little tight around the hips and I don't love the material, but all-in-all, a decent shirt."
3.0,"so I bought this maybe a month ago, had to force myself not to take it off. the strap is stiff, and by that I mean it doesn't sit centered. I moved the little plastic strap hold closer to the center but then the strap is completely jutting out from the watch and looks awkward as hell. overall, beautiful watch but I hate it !!!<br /><br />* one last thing, the light on this watch looks so cheap. a dim green comes from the left side and barely reaches the first digit."
3.0,Way too short and tight. Plus the patches are more like 3D flowers making you feel like you have large flaps hanging off your arms
3.0,Good pair of sunglasses. Don't feel cheap and last a long time. Had mine for 3 moths but broke because I wasn't careful with them
3.0,I bought these for myself but they are larger than my lobs.  Thankfully my husband has bigger eara than me.  They don't fit very tight to the war so the kinda look a little off but he likes them. Thanks
3.0,This is an ok shirt it's a cheap t-shirt with the hard print on it which I'm sure the first time it's washed the print will split....so I'm definitely not going to be throwing it in the dryer
3.0,"I wear my hair in locs and these were nice to pull them up or to cover my locs.  The fabric is very lightweight, so they are comfy to wear.  I like that the fabric is soft and won't pull my hair.  The ends are unfinished, so I am afraid that they may unravel.  I wash them in a lingerie bag like I do my delicates and hang them to dry- I don't think they will last through the dryer.  But for the money I paid, you can't beat these to cover your hair or use for a  headband around your locs or braids."
3.0,Loved everything but it was to small so I got the next size up
3.0,"Bought this for a little one that's always about 90th% for height and parallels Carter's to a T. I bought the dress in the 12 - 18 month size and at 15 months, it is already too short with the diaper cover snapped. I had to unsnap it and tuck it inside a separate cover. It's not a huge deal because the dress is not the &quot;Shirley Temple&quot; style I was expecting. The skirt is so long and overlapped you can't see the cover or any cute, chubby baby thighs anyway. It comes down to knee-length. And the kid cries when trying to crawl and play in it because of this.<br /><br />Also, the neckline is a little weird. The back has a v-neck and looks like the front and vice-versa. And because both sides of the neck are so wide, the straps are always falling off the shoulders.<br /><br />I paid about $9.00 for this item shipped because I really loved the print, but it's really not a cute, people-will-stop-and-ask-where-you-got-it type of dress. The fit is very awkward, there's no real craftsmanship, and the print is pretty boyish upon arrival. Meh. LO will wear it on off days."
3.0,"It keeps me warm in my cold office. However, the fuzz on the inside sheds on my clothes."
3.0,they are okay...
3.0,"ok workout shirt. Slightly see-through and pills quickly. The little Gem is a cute touch in the back. I wish the fabric was better quality. If it were, I would order more."
3.0,The fabric is VERY thin….not really worth the cost.
3.0,"I wanted a neoprene glasses case and figured the straps were a nice bonus. Case is very thin/flimsy and BARELY fits a normal sized pair of women’s sunglasses. The straps will likely work well to hold the glasses on your head, but they are so short that you can’t comfortably carry them around your neck.<br /><br />I was looking for something to hold my sunglasses while playing in the ocean with my kids, and this doesn’t quite meet my expectations. Still, I’ll likely keep the set and give it a try (hardly worth the return hassle for the money)."
3.0,I really like the colors and the fabric. If your company could make the waist bands consistent in size -- you would have a winning product!!  Thanks. .
3.0,"Sent the wrong color, but other than that decent quality."
3.0,"I had it for only 2 days, and the buckle fell off. I'm pretty sure that I can sew or glue it to where it won't, so I don't plan on returning it or anything.<br />And I'm still glad that I bought it. The price was good, it's pretty (even without the buckle) and the size is GREAT! Also, I love the outside pocket. It's a perfect place to put my keys so I'm not digging in my purse when I get back out the car."
3.0,"Much more charcoal than black. If you get over the color, it’s nice"
3.0,"the shorts is not bad however the fabric is a little thin, based on what I read, I was expecting it to be a little thicker and it felt a little big, and a little expensive in my opinion"
3.0,I sent it back. it was cute but way too big.
3.0,"Thin material, not very durable. OK quality"
3.0,Looks great they are a gift
3.0,A bit this so if you have boobs it stretches and you can see right through it.
3.0,"This is very pretty but doesn't come down my arms nearly as far as the one in the photos does. One size does not fit all. If you are small to medium, this is probably a good fit for you. If you are large, it's not. I'm keeping it anyway because I don't have time to shop around and wait for a replacement."
3.0,I like the shirt but would recommend anyone to size up 1 or 2 sizes if they want a fit like the photo shows.
3.0,"Love this pants but had to return it because it's not true to size, it was to big."
3.0,"This shirt is cute, but it feels cheap. Also, I thought I was buying purple and it’s definitely red."
3.0,These feel great but there is no give. Size up.
3.0,Cute dress. Its t-shirt material and very stretchy. Nothing fancy but comfortable to wear.  I ordered xl and fits great.
3.0,"Fabric is a bit more polyester than cotton but has nice “drape” to it and feels soft. Just wish it had higher cotton content. Also, the back of the shirt is solid yellow, no splattered bleach look like on the front, which is disappointing."
3.0,"I received this as a gift yesterday (yes I took the tags off, so it was brand new) and out of the packaging it already has small spots of tarnish. Would not reccomend the quality of the bracelet. But it is really adorable & fits well."
3.0,The sandals are wonderful except if you wear them in gravel or sand. Then they act like a shovel and they fall off from the weight.
3.0,The fit was perfect but the dress was returned because it was not as full as shown on the picture. The fullness is what I found attractive about the dress.
3.0,"Received the belt today. I followed the included instructions to trim the belt to my size, and I am wearing it as I type this. I've been intrigued by ratchet belts for a while, but finally made this purchase. Generally speaking, I like it. I grew tired over the years about always seeming to be in between holes on a normal belt. Since we all go up and down in size a bit from day to day, 1&#34; belt holes really don't make much sense. A ratchet belt solves that problem. Woo-Hoo! So why only 3 stars? Becasue the racheting mechanism clamps down on ridges/cams stamped into the underside of the belt. It's a nice concept except that there are *no ridges* on the last 4-5&#34; of the belt. (See attached photo.) So if you trim your new belt down so that there is not much hanging out of the buckle, there is nothing for the ratchet to engage. For me, when I'm standing up and moving about, the belt fits great. But after dinner tonight I retired to my favorite chair, clicked the release on the bottom of the buckle, and lengthened the belt just a hair. Oops, the belt loosened all right, but it ran out of ridges, so it sits loose but not engaged. I'd prefer my belt not to disengage when I stand up! And honestly, having 6 inches or more of excess belt outside of the &#34;buckle&#34; is esthetically not very pleasing. So, when re-sizing your belt, remember to leave *much more* excess than you'd probably like, or you'll end up like me."
3.0,"The crystal was longer then I expected but it was very pretty, until after a week it broke and fell off the chain. The bracelet is still holding up nicely."
3.0,"They feel as if they will break if you open them up to fast so that isn't okay, but other than that they fit well and look great on my face. Just beware of the cheap plastic and how fragile you'll have to be when you receive them."
3.0,they look good but the loop to put your glasses thru is a little smalll.  still love the look.  second be careful as one has already broke at the loop but it still makes a good flag pin to wear.  Will not order more as it is just not what i really like in an eyeglass pin.  as i said loop is to small #1
3.0,Does not support and flattens. Not a very flattering look.
3.0,"Usable for a project I have in mind, but useless as is. I was ASSURED they would not roll down. They roll right off if I so much as bend forward or sneeze."
3.0,"Material is thin. Fits small, I got 2 sizes bigger and it was still tight on my hips."
3.0,"The pink part is kinda small size for big bust. It’s a nice comfy warm lounge though, but the neck part is almost weird and uncomfortable"
3.0,"Fit was fine. I normally wear a medium, and medium fits well.<br />I didn’t like the material. It’s not a soft cotton. Feels more like a polyester. The print is on the outside, the inside fabric is white. I returned."
3.0,"The hat was awesome, it was a bummer that the hat didn’t fit on my big head . I guess I will just use the hat as a decoration."
3.0,quality okay
3.0,"Wears good, very light weight, but the arm holes are way more open in the back than in the front. Makes it look rather ... strange."
3.0,The fit was good. However color not as displayed in pic
3.0,"The style is nice but mine looks nothing like the color in the product picture. The pearls strung on the back are brown, but the discs in front are not. They are gold/yellow and do not match the pearls in back. Neither my white nor brown pearl earrings will go with this necklace. Disappointed."
3.0,I bought a large and it fit like a small
3.0,"You get what u pay for, much smaller than the pic, very thin material. Has a bad odor. Not sure if keeping"
3.0,"Way too large. I measured my child's foot and according to the product description these should have fit. They were enormous, almost comically baggy and large. Quality was ok, but the sizing was way off."
3.0,My ears did not like these.
3.0,"nice shirt and cut, I wish it had buttons down the front"
3.0,"This band gave me exactly the fit and comfort I was looking for. The fabric is soft enough to be comfortable to wear all day and there aren't sharp edges poking from the velcro. I was glad to have ordered the two pack. The black was fine (although not a true black, it does have lighter threads woven in), the red definitely wasn't red. It's more of a pink or coral."
3.0,"Go the next size up, considering you're probably gonna wear thermals and undies unermeath"
3.0,"These were cute, but fit quite tight on the calves (and my calves aren't large). Sent them back."
3.0,"I like color and quality of the goggles and the paint job on these. They do look rustic. Not cheapie plastic looking. For the price, I would expect the strap to be a bit better quality, but these are acceptable."
3.0,Beautiful shirt but the price is way higher than at Shein and guess what it came from there 3 times more expensive. Ugh!
3.0,They are cute and fun. Not the highest quality but worth the price.
3.0,"The dress is gorgeous but is way bigger than expected. It's slightly poofy too. I will have to safety pin the pleats down and wear a belt. XS is NOT XS. XS fits more like a medium in terms of width. I'm 5' 5&#34; and the length is just right.  Other than that, I am content with the way it looks."
3.0,Pulls really easily
3.0,They’re great looking sunglasses. Very retro and seem to block glare from the sun fairly well.  The only drawback is that they’re really really big.
3.0,It’s very cute but gets really static! It’s also very thin so definitely wear a slip under!
3.0,I was not so pleased with the product.  To use it as a hidden pocket did not seem to work well at all.  Even small items kept scarf from hanging well.  So the main reason I ordered it was for the zipper pocket to hold my items.  I can still use it as a plain scarf.  It is light and I will enjoy using it that way.
3.0,Shirt had a mini hole in it. Other than that it fits well. I actually could have gone down a size
3.0,"Color is great but this fabric is odd and rather uncomfortable. I'm not sure how to describe it; initially you might think it's an athletic shirt with some sort of wicking except it's not...it's hot and clings to the body but not in a smooth way. Instead, it's wrinkled and clingy, hot and overall unattractive. The shirt itself is made well but the fabric makes this a no-go at least for me...I'm giving it a neutral rating which is rather generous but perhaps someone else doesn't mind the fabric."
3.0,La textura es buena y protege del frio pero comparando en size hay mucha diferencia muy pequeño. Una persona medium debería servirle el 2xl cómodo.
3.0,They run small and keep sliding around so the nonskid is on top of foot.
3.0,"It was one the Christmas gifts for my wife. The shirt came without a tag, wrinkled, without any plastic cover or clips- basically, it looked like someone picked it up off their closet floor, folded it, and shipped it. The quality is ok- it's nothing to write to write home about. Honestly, it even feels &#34;soft&#34;- like, softer than it should, almost like it'd already been worn & washed... I bought her 2 other shirts from another company for about the same price ($2 more) and they were delivered like they were shipped from a store. Their quality is outstanding- well worth the money...this one, not so much. And even though it's her size, it's too small..."
3.0,They run small and short. Other than that great product
3.0,"I was not a fan of this dress. If you have a little extra chunk, this isn’t for you. I bought the large for my 5’2”, 155 lb self and it was not flattering.  It made my love handles look even larger than they are, and the sleeves were too long. The material is thick. It appears to be good quality, but I didn’t examine it closely.<br /><br />I think the dress would be great for someone skinny and tall. I am neither. I returned the dress."
3.0,A beautiful band but the peg that keeps the watch on keeps popping out and turning backwards. My watch fell off in my back yard.
3.0,Cute design. Not as bright as it is shown online
3.0,too larger
3.0,"Bought these as a lightweight travel shoe for my 9 year old daughter.  They fit her as expected (when using the size chart), and they are cute, light, and airy.  However, the Velcro strap became a nuisance after a few wears.  It started to stick up and annoy her and made the shoe look messy.  Otherwise, good shoe for the price paid."
3.0,It's a little long in the leg otherwise it fits fine.
3.0,These are very pretty and stylish but note the fabric is thin and does not offer a lot of support/shape.
3.0,Bigger than it measured around hips
3.0,"This shirt was great material and I would give it 5 stars except the word &#34;the&#34; in &#34;Get to the Choppa&#34; was misspelled! It was spelled &#34;tde&#34;. So I went back and looked at the advertised picture on Amazon and lo and behold it was also misspelled, but &#34;tse&#34;! Don't know if there was a copyright on the &#34;Get to the Choppa&#34; phrase or what! I did NOT notice the misspelling immediately, I think my brain auto-corrected it due to my familiarity with the phrase, but on closer inspection, there it was, &#34;TSE&#34;, not THE. I went on and gave the shirt to my grandson because his dad works with special ops and is a fan of Arnold S! (Plus most of his friends can't read!) I would be really interested in knowing WHY the word was misspelled, and why it was misspelled different on the shirt I bought compared to the one in the Amazon picture!"
3.0,Stitching is beginning to loosen up. But received A compliment.
3.0,Had a flaw in the printing
3.0,Shipped defective. Shoulder strap was sewn on twisted. Otherwise cute dress. Lightweight chiffon...wrinkles easily. Length to the floor. I'm 5'5.
3.0,The shirt fits ok but sleeves are a little too long.  The material is very thin and not stretched. You will have to wear something under.
3.0,Larger than anticipated so they don’t lay properly on your ear lobe unless you make them really tight<br />Or you need a different backing
3.0,Not exactly water proof
3.0,[[VIDEOID:f173f27bf65dd8bfde04a9e7c5865866]] There goooddd
3.0,"Smaller than the picture, it looks like for a kid not for an adult but not bad"
3.0,These do not fit like boxer briefs  they have a tendency to ride up because the trunk leg parts are too short- a bit more length and elastic would suffice here otherwise they’ll end up like a thong while you’re wearing them for awhile
3.0,Runs large and the color is more rust than burgundy.  Style is ok.  Keeping it but wouldn't reorder this style.
3.0,The tie is nice enough.  Sadly the tartan is a screen printing and not a true weave.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it was much bigger than I anticipated.  The sparkles were pretty, but otherwise seemed to grown up and big for a little girl."
3.0,The straps just don't stay together.  I need to get them sewn so they don't fall apart.
3.0,"I wear headbands for all my runs, workouts to keep sweat off my face.  I actually like Velcro a lot.  Probably about half inch too thick, but I just fold it down."
3.0,"The color is more a pink/orange, not a macho toxic man color.  Information in data windows is small.  Pain to get started.  Those were the reasons for the 3 rating.  The code scan on the watch tag does not work.<br />You need the correct Casio APP installed on your phone; therefore, YOU need to go to the Casio web site and find the User Guide for module 5641.  Download the APP and try to follow along for pairing.  I do not intend to use this for anything other than timekeeping, so I have no idea if the other functions are good.  I have an Android Ware 2 smart watch if I want to go down the fitness road.  I have no idea what the occasional beep sound means; I need to search the 27-page User Guide for the answer.  Papers within the box indicate a 2-year battery life under the specified conditions.  My advice: Wait for a solar version of this."
3.0,It is  nice however it worn up so fast because of staples in the small belt.
3.0,"These pants are given exactly what they are supposed to i like the softness of them but they runs really big , these are a size medium but they fit like a large"
3.0,"The picture makes it look better than it is.  But for the price, ok"
3.0,It makes no mention of this in the listing buy the socks are glittery. It makes them look like holiday socks which is not what I wanted them for. 3 stars because they're still good quality.
3.0,Looks small enough for a pre-teen to wear..  but after all the shirt itself is really cute If only it could fit perfectly.
3.0,"This is a nice ring.  It has a good weight and looks great on the hand.  The reason for the 3 starts is,  in my opinion,  the gold is a bit too yellow so that is obvious that the ring isn't real up close.  Other than that I really do luke this ring and wear it often.  It's very comfortable for a ring of this size.  It arrived before the estimated date."
3.0,"So as the title suggests, they sent me literally two right hand gloves lol. I can't wear it on my left hand without it looking offputting. I'm sure it was just a mistake, however I cannot wear these out. Also the material is kind of itchy, and I can't use my phone or any touch screen with it on. They are just meh :/"
3.0,My son wanted this so we read the reviews and it said buy 1 size up so we did still was too small had to return and go another size up and still snug
3.0,I really liked the color and the style but the material is horrible
3.0,"Quality is cheap, as expected,  but what I really don't like is that these are very large like 2 1/2 inches in diameter. I was expecting something smaller. They look odd."
3.0,"This outfit is really cute but the sewing is done without any detail. The shorts are just cut at the bottom, not hemmed, so they look like they are unfinished. Probably why this was so inexpensive."
3.0,"This dress is very cute and made well, however, I am 5’7 and the lining was extremely too short. While I would have loved to keep this dress because the overall look and fit were as expected it was entirely too short."
3.0,"They're a bit narrow across the top of the foot, but the next size larger would be way too large.  The price is good."
3.0,Great product. Except it only lasted a couple months before the middle part of goggles snapped and broke. My son is on  the swim team and loved how comfortable they are and they don't fog up. Just needs to be more durable.
3.0,This shrinks a little more with every wash. I ordered an xl and now after 2 washes it wears like a size medium fitted tee
3.0,"Cut is nice. Sizing is good, but that seam that runs across the front from neck to belly button is so odd and looked awful on. Will be returning it."
3.0,"The jacket itself was adorable. However, it is listed as being made of wool but most definitely is not. I returned it because it would not be warm enough for the purpose that I needed it.  Also, I suggest changing the information on the listing because it is false and misleading."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:9a00d296e1487cf873e1804f3b050c]] I’m 5’5” and weigh 125 lbs. I normally wear a size 4-6, and the size small fits well. I got the pink shade which is a little see through. I think the top looks like the advertised photo, but it looks much better tucked in than tucked out. When it’s tucked out it hugs my tummy and doesn’t look flattering. It also has a weird cut at the bottom.<br /><br />It’s very soft and comfortable to wear. There is no tag, but it seems to work wearing forwards or backwards. It’s supposed to be hand wash only, but I washed it on delicates and tumble dried it on medium without any problems. It didn’t smell bad when I opened it, which is a plus!<br /><br />I think it’s a decent casual t-shirt, just wish it looked better untucked too."
3.0,Chain was very cheap. It broke the first day I wore it. I only gave it three stars because the star charm was cute.
3.0,"This product felt nice, but runs about 2 sizes too small!"
3.0,"I was quite pleased with the Iron Fist Wugar Skull Grey Witch wallet I purchased.  The problem?  I purchased it as a Christmas gift, only to find that FIVE others had selected this item for the same recipient.  I wonder if it's possible to remove the item when it is selected from the recipient's wish list.  This creates quite a problem as what is she to do with SIX of these wallet?  She said she gave them away.  That is a poor solution but the only option other than returning them.<br /><br />In any case, she loved the wallet!"
3.0,"This is really flowey, it looks better on the model but it's doable I guess. I like the material and lace at the bottom. I also like the neck line. It'll be nice to wear to the beach."
3.0,"For the price this is an overall good hoodie. The neck is pretty tight, and sleeves are long. Probably not made with the best quality fabric . It looks exactly like the picture shows."
3.0,"Really nice hat. My head seems average....to me 😄 (22 inches circumference). I usually have hair extensions or a wig and this hat can't fit. Even with my hair just cornrowed, it was way to small"
3.0,Socks are so soft
3.0,I bought this in a large and the arm sleeves are very tight. Feels like a small. I typically wear medium-large size shirts/ dresses.
3.0,One broke already.  Last one I had lasted for years.  Was more durable
3.0,"I ordered a small and usually wear a size 0-2.  The bikini is very sexy and unique and the top fit just fine.  But the bottom was huge.  It is closer to a medium or even large.  I ended up giving it to my best friend who always has problems finding bikini sets because she is tiny on top and has a big booty.  So, if you have more of a pear shaped body, like my best friend, then this will be perfect for you.  If you are more evenly distributed, stay away."
3.0,"Small, scarf not in bow so you have to attach it somehow to bag and tie the bow.  Now closure."
3.0,The buttons do not stay put- so this means the button slits are made to big for the small buttons
3.0,"Nice fabric, I just needed a smaller size.  It is a compression fit and my tummy area is chubby so I went with the large. I definitely need a smaller size if it's going to give me what I'm looking for."
3.0,Llego pequeño
3.0,Beautiful dress. Two sizes to small. Order up!
3.0,The fit is smaller than i expected and the red is NOT red. Its more CORAL. The deception!!! Other than that its ok.
3.0,Much too tight...due of germs or strangulation. Returned it.
3.0,"The item is slightly narrow, and if you move improperly, it shows that you are wearing the panel.  Also requires another undergarment to attach to, which I had not been prepared for.  I have had a double mastectomy and was hoping for something to wear to hide the scars and to keep me from having to wear a ""pretend"" bra to keep me covered on days I stayed casual."
3.0,"I read other reviews and decided to take a chance on this dress. I'm 5'4&#34; and approximately 125 lbs so. I purchased a size small. I'm long waisted and have a smaller chest size.Usually belt on dresses like this end up being too high. I was pleasantly surprised that this dress fits great. My biggest complaint about the dress is how easily the fabric wrinkles. I'm lazy and don't like to iron. However, I like this dress enough that I may more often."
3.0,My swimsuit arrived today I like it only thing is if you have big boobs the top piece is not for you I wear a 40D in bras the top Part fits like a medium so I’ll just find a red top piece other then that everything is fine
3.0,Keeping  it just because I don’t feel like dealing with the hassle of returning. The quality of the sweater is really nice it’s thick. It looks like it just as in the picture. However something is weird with the sleeves and neck it’s like it doesn’t sit properly no matter how you try to fix it on your body and apparently others have had this issue too. I kind of have to wear it slouchy in off of one shoulder but it’s still nice.
3.0,"The medium was just about half the size or size too small for me. Also the length was a couple inches above the ankle and the color, which I thought was a turquoise was actually green when I got it. I’m going to try again and order the size large in a different color and see if it’s any better.<br /><br />Update: I returned the medium and purchased a large and it fits perfect. My suggestion would be to size up. I got the color called charcoal blue and it is true to the picture color. I’m happy with these. I might purchase another color"
3.0,I love the bracelet and it fit well for two months now the elastic is all stretched out and I am afraid all the beads are going to fall off.
3.0,Love this! Hubby loved it as well for pairing with jeans or skirt. The snap bottom could be a little longer so you don't have to put body in weird positions to have it button. Once buttoned it bunched up in lower back area
3.0,There ok didn't stay n very long. They kept wanting to pop out my ear :(
3.0,Ordered this dress (yellow) for Easter and was a little disappointed with how sheer it was.  I had to wear a coverup to cover the backside
3.0,Even with a nude bra. It feels ok quality but I can't d al with the sheerness
3.0,I am giving this 3 stars even though I have to return it. This item runs very large. The style itself is beautiful. Please be careful of the size you order.
3.0,"I loved them until I washed them, they really wrinkle after dried."
3.0,Good quality and really pretty but I typically wear large and ordered XXL. Fit in arms and chest but it was tight across the stomach and is much shorter than I'd prefer.<br />UPDATE: when I attempted to return (it said free returns) I was contacted with an offer to keep the shirt and they'd give me 1/2 my money back to cover the cost of shipping. When I said it felt like I scam because it said free returns I received a msg saying to keep the shirt and they'd refund my total paid.  Doesn't seem right it says free returns and they ask for money.
3.0,"I just got this and I have to return it. I wear a size large/14 US and this double extra large was way too small in the shoulders so I couldn’t move my arms. The length of the sleeve was OK as was the length of the jacket. It was about 10 inches from overlapping in front, even though I bought the recommended size from their size chart. The material seems like it would be OK and it’s fully lined, so it looks nice. The patch pockets are adequate, although not double stitched, so don’t overdo."
3.0,"I ordered a 16.5 neck and 34/35 sleeves, the shirt arrived quickly and the bag had the right size written on the sticker, but today when packing for a trip I discovered that the actual shirt was a 16.5 neck and 32/33 sleeves. So the sleeves size are  too short for my husband to wear. Nice quality, great fit overall except that the bag/package with bar code and size and the actual shirt size did not match. Now it is too late to return/exchange it."
3.0,"Despite following the size chart guidelines, this was too tight and it definitely does not fit as shown. The saving grace is that my granddaughter loves it and it fits her fine (she's 13 years old!) I think the size chart, regardless of the buyer being warned about the sizing, is based on a standard created by the fashion industry, not for an average female."
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, but it's made very wide yet short.  I'm 5'8.5&#34; and about 190 lbs and the shirt was huge width wise, but came just to my belt loop!  Us larger ladies like shirts to come down a bit.  At least to the tops of our butts.  This did not!  I was really disappointed!"
3.0,"This would be great for a ukulele, but not a guitar."
3.0,If you want a set for lounging or around the house this might be it. It is thin and not compressive or controlling in any way. Strangely its not see through based on how thin the material is. The top provides absolutely no support so you will need a bra underneath. The shorts are super cute though.
3.0,Nothing wrong with the item but I used the dimensions as decision to purchase as opposed to others.  it is actually 4.15 inches wide not 3.5 inches as listed.  If dimensions matter watch it.
3.0,"Color was not a match, makes my Apple Watch 4 look cheap"
3.0,"I’m a size Small (stitchfix) or medium (Target) for examples. I purchased this in a medium and it’s so tight I can barely even get it on. However, once it’s on... it looks pretty good. I wish I would have gone up to a large but i think the scaling is extremely off because I am in no way a large."
3.0,Material looks cheap and it fits weird - i returned this item
3.0,"The fit is good, but I went with this skeleton jersey because it looked different from all the other cheap looking ones. It looks cheap."
3.0,It's not terrible quality. But the skin on your thighs needs to be TIGHT for this to remotely look good. I had a significant weight loss and my butt just droops over the back of it and it looks awful.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. It looked gorgeous on the photo - but based on the size chart I should have been around a size M [L if I based it off chest measurements alone.] I ended up having to return it the first time around because it was too loose, so I got it in the smallest size - S - but it still did not shape well. I think it's very comfy to wear and the sparkling design looks professional and classy, but it just did not make my body look good. The pictures made it seem like it was more of a body con style but I wish there had been a size smaller or a way to tie the waist tighter because the small area they give you to tie a bow is only for the front."
3.0,Loved this dress!! But I only wore it one time and then the strap broke off in the wash. Annoyed.
3.0,"These are too small, the material is thin and cheap, and the storage bag is not attached as other bags used for grocery totes are. I don;'like them."
3.0,"I am a short skinny person and these are made for tall skinny people. (I am 5'6"" and 108lbs)  I ordered a size medium and it feels like a size small. They are really comfortable for the price point and the joggers have great pockets. The legs are too long though and I have to roll the cuffs. The elastic in the waistband rolls as well which is frustrating to deal with."
3.0,I like how soft the fabric is but this sweater runs big. I normally wear a medium but I'm currently wearing a large due to recently giving birth.  This sweater fits larger than normal.<br /> It was shrink wrapped when I received it and extremely wrinkled. I had to use the wrinkle release setting on my dryer to get wrinkles out. Even then some wrinkles still remain.
3.0,"These Generations jeans fit just like the Comfy Curvy skinny jeans, (and you should still order a size below what you wear in Levi’s or other brands), but they are not made as well. I had already recently purchased two pairs of the Comfy Curvy and really liked them. The waistband pretty much stays above the muffin top which is what I was looking for :-)  These Generations jeans are a little thinner, and the belt loops are definitely not as strong. Other than that, they seem identical to the Comfy Curvy. If you have a choice between one and the other, take the Comfy Curvy jeans."
3.0,A little smaller than expected but still a great bag
3.0,Good looking shoe (exactly like the photos) but came up way large (8.5 fit like a 9.5)... also not sure how long the faux leather would have lasted.<br /><br />Returned after trying on.
3.0,Nice gloves but they looked nothing like the pic. They were more like compression gloves for people with arthritis.
3.0,I used for protecting my crochet hair styles
3.0,I really liked the soft and light material of these tanks however they were extremely static-y.
3.0,Thinner and less compression than the Adidas models I've used before.
3.0,They don't fit me or my wife. They are sized for very small faces.
3.0,"Butterflies and leaves were bent in weird ways and it was scuffed and scratched in different places. Some parts could be bent back into place, so from far away it doesn't look too bad."
3.0,This is not a bad night gown I just wasn’t a fan of the material. It’s like what work out shirts are made of. Comfortable enough though.
3.0,"I love the scarf, but the label clearly says “100% silk FEELING, 100% polyester”"
3.0,"...product is good except for its size...too small , hope it's a little bit bigger..."
3.0,Good steal will not infect if done right
3.0,IT LOOKED BETTER ON THE PICTURE THEN IT DID ONCE DELIVERED
3.0,"My feet are wide-ish - not wide enough that I normally require a “wide” but if there’s a wide offered I’ll get it. That said, whereas I can normally wear a regular with no ill effects, these are too narrow and uncomfortable."
3.0,Would be cute if it fit. Bought to wear under low. It tops. Size 10 36c - I can't wear the small/large. It's so tight it's extremely uncomfortable.  Size up.
3.0,Seems no one is actually selling the real thing. They are all jewelry cast from the original design. Good casting but still just a copy. Eh.
3.0,"It is not very smooth when it comes to opening and closing.  Also once you close it it's very hard to fit back into the sleeve, which makes it hard to store in the bag.  Not satisfied."
3.0,its very cute  but looks as if it will wash away after a few laundry cycles .... I could be wrong.
3.0,Very tight neck and weirdly sewn.
3.0,Item was beautiful! I could not wear because it was uncomfortable for me.
3.0,"The fabric of this dress is very costumey and I think it runs a bit big. It’s pretty, but the price is a reflection of the quality."
3.0,"Thick and bulky, but they do the job and wash well. More stars if the cut was smarter/more contoured like regular panties. Too much/high fabric in the front leaves the toddler preferring regular underwear when I prefer her to wear the training underwear."
3.0,"It serves the purpose, the shirt is extremely thin however so you need to wear another shirt under it."
3.0,"A little too tight, nose comfort isn't great either, but not terrible.  The look is ... ok.  It helps to have a hat on.  Tint is perfect, just what I like, just wish the glasses were more comfortable.  Oh well, I took a chance.  These are getting sidelined."
3.0,This is very difficult to put on.  I have yet to figure out how put it on without having age loop hanging down.
3.0,quality not the best got them for daughter xmas 2014 super glued 1\2 the flowers back on already. I would spend the extra $ now
3.0,Had to return as it didn't give enough protection from my glasses.
3.0,"...and now he probably doesn't even know where it is!<br /><br />aahhh..youth<br /><br />This toy was a little difficult to get together at first. It also wouldn't work for some reason but with a bit of tinkering, we got it working. The double saber option makes for an enormous saber..particularly for an 8 year old. It also doesn't work the same on both sides, so we went back to just one side.<br /><br />The sounds and lights are cool and my little guy really does seem to like it. (when he remembers he has it!) I personally thought it was a bit pricey at $35+ but since I saw it elsewhere online for $99...!!!! Amazing the rip offs out there...probably got it too as this thing was impossible to find at Christmas..thank goodness for January birthdays!<br /><br />Overall...a neat toy for those obsessed with all things Star Wars...albeit a pricey one."
3.0,My son is on the upper end of the shoe size range for the laceez we purchased bit the laceez seem to tight making it difficult to get his shoes on.  We may try the next size up and a different brand.
3.0,"I always order an XL so they're loose. Being outside in the south in the summer,  it gets hot. Better to have loose fitting clothing. Ordered two in an XL and they are very small around the chest area.  Fabric is soft, shirt would overall be comfortable if it fit properly.  Next time I will just pay the extra and order the name brand golf shirts."
3.0,"Wallet is a little small, if travel will not hold the larger bills issued in other countries.  Good for US currency, just single pocket in bill holder section."
3.0,"I got 2 pairs. One in black with pinstripes and then the solid white ones. The black with pinstripes came with a torn belt loop which is an easy fix so I don't mind too much. They are very long. Have to be worn with heels unless you are 5'8&#34;. I received a ton of compliments on them. Now, the white ones are so see through that every flaw will show and nothing can be hidden under this material. I do not suggest buying them in white."
3.0,"Nice enough dress but be warned, the “pink” is actually very peach, not even a little bit pink. I needed it to coordinate for family pictures. Have to return it and continue the hunt."
3.0,"Crndzsis Womens 2 Tone Shawls Cashmere Feel Pashmina Shawls Wraps Scarf is one of the softest things I have ever touched.  I can't want for the climate to go back to normal so that I can actually wear it.  It's been 80 degree up here in the midatlantic.  I could use those typical 60 degree days.  However, I am excited to wear to this to work as I walk to the bus stop.  I commute via mass transit and waiting 5-10 minutes in 50-60 degree mornings you need something, but you don't necessarily want a coat.  Well this seems to be the ticket.  The colors are nice and lays and sits nicely on the shoulders.  This isn't a true pashmina and nor is it real cashmere, but it feels heavenly and I am really happy to add this to my wardrobe.  I will be using this for years to come."
3.0,"Liked the heavier material, but it was terribly missed sized. I just held it up to me and tried to stretch the waist and it didn't budge."
3.0,"It's cute enough, didn't work for my costume. The material is definitely a bit cheaper looking and the color isn't quite right. More of an orange than a brown, but the price isn't bad for what it is."
3.0,"I ordered an xL in pink, way to big but I like loose fit so no biggie. I should have chosen a different color as the pink shows any spill and leaves water mark if you spot clean it. Super cute summer dress, can also be dressed up."
3.0,"These are very comfortable and fit nicely when right out of the dryer, but they do stretch considerably after a short time wearing them. I'm suffering from saggy butt in them. I'd say, go with the smaller size than you think so that they still feel comfortable after they've stretched."
3.0,Great shirt but way too small.  I am returning it and I had to replace a 2x plaid shirt with a 4x in a solid color and it fits perfect.
3.0,Love the positive message but shirt much smaller than size ordered
3.0,"You could argue size is relative… but I feel these are just a tad too big. If the bottoms of the frames were about a 1/4” shorter, they’d look really sharp.<br /><br />They do turn everting a pinkish/purple hue, which is downright nauseating indoors. However, outdoors I am amazed with the clarity.<br /><br />They look pretty good and feel durable. If you have a larger face, they might fit you well (not to say I have a small face, I just think these are too large)"
3.0,Not very thick as expected from Sherpa. Very nice appearance.
3.0,"This is pretty & fits well, but too heavy for 90+ degree weather.  Nice fall top!"
3.0,It fit smaller and it was for homecoming
3.0,The jacket was nice and warm but the track for the zipper is not durable or is cheap. It broke on the first day wearing it.  This jacket to me isn't made for a person with a big chest. It's tight unless you get it  in a larger size but the sleeves might be to long. So if you lift weights you might want to consider another brand that is looser.
3.0,Its super cute on! Looks really good. Fits well! Unfortunately it's pretty cheaply made.. thread's were coming out before I even put it on..HOWEVER...I expected as such since it was such a good price! You do get what you pay for.. as far as fit..I'm usually a small and I bought a medium and fits perfect  and I like my clothes tight. It has a drawstring waist so you can fit your but AND your waist...all in all it was a good buy
3.0,My only problem is the neck line is tight and it has a small opening for the head. If your over 5'10 it's not a full length maxi dress.
3.0,The product is good and I like it however I had wanted purple and got black
3.0,El algodón se deteriora con los lavados
3.0,The right heel is crooked and feels like its going to break.
3.0,It is pretty to look at and tough to use. Four stars because it is sooooooo pretty. I had to subtract one because I cannot use it as a tote like I planned. The opening is slightly blocked by the zipper placement.
3.0,"They’re so cute but a bit too heavy. I’m so sensitive with earring weight and I can only wear these occasionally. However, on the spectrum from light-heavy they’re on the lighter side."
3.0,"I typically wear a L or XL. XL fits great.  I’ll preface this by saying I typically run warm, but the rayon/spandex material mix provides little to no breathing."
3.0,Runs small.  Very wrinkly but very good price.
3.0,"My iPhone 6 fits inside it and it's overall cute, however the stylus was missing."
3.0,Ring verities are awesome and looks good with all kind of sizes. But they are for short time and find them very comfortable wear.<br />I don't think this rings golded coating will stay longer. With in hours those rings color changed.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress and was ready to buy it in every color if it fit.<br />It was cut so strangely. Fit will in the chest and even the length was fine (but please note it is short however I’m 5’9). The weird thing is is the neck cut. It’s so small.  I don’t consider myself to have a huge head, however I could barely get my head threw the hole and then it was hardly a v-neck once on.<br />One last thing too. The material is somewhat scratchy. It’s ruff feeling. Of course I didn’t wash it cuz I’m returning it but just trying it on the material was not soft at all, actually it was uncomfortable"
3.0,"Love this top, however I’m 5’3” and it is so long that it could be a dress."
3.0,"The fabric was weird, I returned it"
3.0,These are really great no show panties… But terrible for the gym. They’re very very thin so you can wear them under tight skirts or dresses and lines shouldn’t be a problem however there is Nothing to keep them tight around your legs and butt so they slip and slide all over the place.  They were very breathable.
3.0,my husband got this for me.  He liked it but not my style.  Nice dress but I just didn't like the style of it.  Good quality and fabric though
3.0,"It does the job.  I don't normally buy wigs, and was unaware that I was expected to do some trimming myself."
3.0,Not sure how much wear I'll get out of this but it's expected for what I paid for it
3.0,"I read the reviews and even looked at the pictures in the reviews before ordering, but the no-show socks that I received did not have a silicon nonslip design on the balls of the feet, only on the heel of the sock.  The elastic is not too tight and the socks have stayed on my feet all day without peeking through my dress shoes.  BUT my feet slip around in my shoes making it a little harder to walk without worrying that I might slip."
3.0,"The sweatshirt itself is fine. Looks just like the photos. I gave it a 3 star for how it was packaged. It was packaged in a vacuum sealed bag and it came out incredibly wrinkled, total bummer."
3.0,Not really crystals disappointed
3.0,"I am frustrated with their sizing chart. My son is 13 months old and 17.5 lbs. The sizing chart seems really far off so I asked Coolibar about it. They said it’s correct and that I should base what I order off of his height and weight. So I ordered 6-12 months because it’s supposed to fit babies between 18-23 pounds. I got it in today and it is way too small. It’s really short and wide. It would fit an 8 month baby at most. I understand that “all babies are different” but don’t have a size chart that is obviously not correct, in which I already asked them about. Ignore the height and weight and just order what size your baby wears at Target."
3.0,Ring is nice but runs small. I wear 7 and it cant fit
3.0,It fits well but the print is not as nice as the picture
3.0,"I bought these because I always wear a 'cap' at home due to my hair loss. They are looser than expected. I am going to use them, but wear them 'backwards' as they fit better that way. (I will put the front in the back of my neck and back on my forehead.) I was also going to try to put one in the dryer as I am sure that will shrink it also. But, they are very well made and the patterns are very nice. The price for three was great also."
3.0,it's good if your chilly. def over sized like it says. the only thing is the collar is a it tight for it being an over sized sweater
3.0,EL COLOR ES MAS CLARO DE LO QUE PENSE
3.0,"My fault for not reading closely enough, but I wasn't expecting the built-in underwear. a bit on the short side for a woman in her 40s who USED to be a runner, but all in all very cute athletic  shorts"
3.0,Love the shapes and colors of the bracelet. But it doesn't seem to work for bigger ladies. And the stones seem a little ruddy. It's still pretty though.
3.0,This is  nice and simple  .Plenty space inside.<br /> I don't like the joining of material in the middle at the back.  It makes my expensive bag look cheap
3.0,"I had a hard time trying to decide these were somewhat small or large.  The fit is just... strange.  So much so that I wonder if it was a manufacturing defect.  I'm 5'9, about 185, so I bought an XL. Proportionally, my legs are slightly short and my torso long.  That said, the legs don't quite go all the way down to my ankles, or rather don't stay there, (which I'm used to so whatever) but the waist goes ALL THE WAY UP to my bust before it's even stretching!  Width-wise, though, they fit, and are comfortable enough once you get used to the waist being all the way up there.  I live in a rural area, so for what they cost it wasn't worth the effort of returning.<br />I'm not upset about the purchase, and I still wear them, but won't purchase again."
3.0,"This swimsuit is really cute but the top did not work for me. I'm a B cup and the cups left a gap no matter how I adjusted it. The back strap also caused my small amount of back flab to look gross. The bottom fit perfectly and is high-rise. I wear a medium in clothing but sized up to a large for this according to other reviews, which was a good move. Overall it's a cute swimsuit but I wasn't in love with it."
3.0,A cute style and could work for a narrower foot. I normally wear in 8 1/2W  and ordered  9's which were just a bit too narrow for the edge of my foot.
3.0,"Goofy, stylish, but I can't get these near my eyes to wear them as proper sunglasses. Perhaps it's an eyelash problem, but I think these are just meant to be work on the bridge of your nose."
3.0,"The armpits hang really loose on this and make it look wonky... it's super comfy, but just really not flattering. I returned it."
3.0,It's cute and good material but not ment for petite women
3.0,Order 2 sizes up if you reaaaaaally want it.
3.0,It is not what I expected
3.0,"I originally LOVED this item, yet my love quickly faded; the belly button ring was cheapily made, and the fleur de lis fell off shortly after wearing it..."
3.0,Really like it. Nice color. Find myself readjusting frequently.
3.0,"if this gets thrown in the dryer it shrinks disproportionately. Gets very short, sleeve stay longish. Still cute tho lol"
3.0,Boxy fit and weird. Size down instead of up on this one.<br />I purchased an XXL instead of my normal XL
3.0,"I love the color blocking of the black and white.  I loved the feel of the material.<br /><br />But ... I'm too busty and the girls need stretch in the fabric, and this has none.<br /><br />It's a shame - its totally adorable!"
3.0,"This bra is very pretty. And even though it says lightly lined, it basically just has little removable pads like a bathing suit and I would say it is UNLINED. However, I actually quite like this style and it is difficult to find bras in my size that fit correctly in unlined bras. The problem I had with the bra and the reason I am ultimately returning it even though I like it well enough is that the lace feels bulky and you can see it under clothes. It gives my breasts a weird shape unless I am wearing a thick top. I think this might be less of a problem is you have larger breasts but I am not sure. Ultimately not for me."
3.0,19mm?
3.0,"This is not dyed or bleached fleece; it feels like cheap polyester and the color is printed on one side. The shape is uncomfortable and unflattering for me; the collar stands up oddly, the shoulder seams are way down on my biceps, and the sleeves are too long."
3.0,I bought my normal size and it fits closer to what I would expect pajamas to fit. It is otherwise comfortable but I would recommend ordering a size down.
3.0,I'm giving 3 stars for the time it took sew the button on properly and to trip the extra threads that were sticking out all over. Over all we loved this dress and got school pictures done in it! It's sorta thin material so it works good on hot days. The colors were very vibrant but material isn't the best. If improvements are made I may consider buying from this company again!
3.0,"Color is much darker than picture, very dark green."
3.0,"After using the socks for a couple of times they have developed some tears, stretching out in the wrong places. They do work well and I use them when I fly."
3.0,I bought a 7/8 I believe for my 50lb 6 yr old and they're way too small. Belly hanging out
3.0,TOO FRAGILE
3.0,This top is beautiful but somewhat small. Be careful when ordering your size.
3.0,"Bad finish, looks cheap"
3.0,"Disappointed in the fit - not really ‘skinny’ jeans - a little too loose for me, but they’re comfortable.  Way too long & full at the bottom.  Maybe sizing is not true....."
3.0,"I got a small and it fitted prefect. I am usually a US size 4-6. Cutting and the Material is pretty good for what I have paid for. However, the front part has a column missing beans. It is quite noticeable. Don't know what to do. Can I do an exchange?"
3.0,"Jeans fit as expected, but there is an embroidered sunflower on the front left pocket not advertised in the item photo. It limits what I can wear with them. Will still keep, but slightly disappointed."
3.0,"There isnt anything wrong with the necklace.  The picture was really blown up to show the detail, but in actuality it is alot smaller than I thought.  It does say 2mm, so my fault on underestimating the size.  I'll keep it, just because but it's not quite what I was looking for in a necklace."
3.0,Her feet were bigger then we thought
3.0,It was cute but it had a big rip in it out of the package
3.0,I get the feeling the material won't last but it still get's the job done!
3.0,This pajama set ran waaay small!!!
3.0,"Like: color, feel, and look. Dislike pocket placement, sizing seems off/small in places, and don’t wash well."
3.0,"Not a good fit, returned."
3.0,I really love these gloves but they are not as durable as I would hope.  The seams could be more reinforced and I agree with other reviews about the &#34;annoying tag&#34;
3.0,Some ties broke on first few times using.  Very small. I keep these in my purse. Makes putting your hair up looks a little more sweet than justa black hair tie. Bow very small.
3.0,I have a big noggin so while this hat fits in that it covers my head it is just a little too tight and becomes uncomfortable after a while.
3.0,"This towel is good quality, and large enough for my child.  I gave it three stars because I probably would not purchase it again.  Here is why:<br />1) White towel:  What was I thinking?  It's completely adorable, but I should have known better<br />2) Odd Shape: The towel itself is a rectangle, so with the hood on, one side is much shorter than the other.  It can make it strange to dry a child that still needs to lay down or sit.<br />3) White hood:  Again, I did not think through the implications of a white hooded towel with a cone shape.  Once I put in on my child it was hard to ignore the similarities to the old southern outfit."
3.0,"Iv bought two of these so far due to the first one catching on a pair of mesh shorts I was wearing and breaking. Same thing happened to the second one except caught on a thread on my shirt. I won't be purchasing another, however if they make the bracelet more durable id love to purchase a new one."
3.0,"Very thin, careful or you can stick your finger thru"
3.0,"Wait, wait, wait.... So do y'all make it a habit of not sending the right sizes? Although I'm really happy on the size you send me bc it fits amazing. I asked for a Large and got a 4xL. That's a huge difference. Lol. Quality is ok. Very thin but the best part is ppl I know won't have this windbreaker."
3.0,"Soooo. This shirt looks so cute work olive green pants. However, my ruffle part is already torn/coming apart. I would say try it but be very careful with the hem at the ruffle part."
3.0,"These shorts are very cute.  I love the tie dye design.  They run large and the fabric is somewhat thin - they are not as thick as a typical yoga short/pant.  I am 5'8"", 135 lbs and ordered a medium, and they are very loose (for an athletic short)."
3.0,"This is a nice little necklace that I purchased for my mom for the holidays.  She was very happy but as I was looking at it I noticed one of the stones had fallen out.  Luckily it was in the box so I was able to repair it with a tiny bit of superglue but I was a little disappointed.  She hadn't even put it on before it fell apart.  When it came to the house I opened it up to inspect it and it was fine, but somewhere between then and my mom unwrapping the box, it came apart.  Hopefully more don't fall out and this was just a freak occurrence."
3.0,"This dress looks great. The colors are the same as pictured, mint, green, and navy. The stitching on the straps came loose after just 1 wearing. I had requested to return it and was going to order another one just like it because it was very comfortable. However, before I could do so I had major foot surgery and was unable to drive for several weeks. By the time I was able to drive and mail it back it was month after the purchase date so I decided to disregard returning it and refined the straps with some needle and thread!"
3.0,Affordable but wish the outer coating (resin) was less yellow and more clear. Definitely a genuine wing and over all a pretty piece with a decent necklace
3.0,"Definitely protects my SE. Not good if you have additional screen protector. Definitely not waterproof, will protect from spills and dust. I do recommend and replace about every 3-6 mos."
3.0,"I used this bag for a while then put it away.  There's nothing seriously wrong with it, but the green color is a bit more on the olive side than I wanted.  My real complaint is with the unnecessary flap that covers the top zipper; it doesn't add a whole lot to the security of the bag and is a nuisance to have to move aside when opening or closing the zipper.  I do like the size and light weight of the bag, and the price was right.  It's just one of those &#34;meh&#34; things."
3.0,Very comfortable but not as durable as I would like
3.0,it seems like a great product...just runs small.  Returned
3.0,"These are nice gloves and feel like they should be pretty warm. Handy since I live in Michigan! That being said, these gloves really don't work well with a cell phone as advertised. Cell phone use is precisely why I bought them. As you can see in the photos I attached, they are nice gloves. If you look closely at two of the photos, I've pulled the index finger of the glove as tightly as possible and am holding it tight by pressing my thumb against it. Pulling it tightly allows me to use my phone but even then it's hit and miss. Pulling on it like will ultimately unravel the tip of the glove's index finger. The upside of that, then I can use my cell phone while wearing these gloves!"
3.0,Pearls don't line up the same as this image
3.0,It's really cute but the girl astronauts black piece for her helmet has already fallen out. I haven't had it very long maybe a couple weeks
3.0,"Fits the arms, loose around rest of body. Pretty typical. I would say its true to color and stretches, but youll need to wear like a belt around the waist in order to not look shapeless. I dont understand why the arms on dresses these days are fitted and the rest of it is so loose... ?<br />The dress is great if you're pregnant lol."
3.0,"Meh.<br /><br />Not really for me. It looks flattering and will hide your stomach if you need it to. I'm 5'7 and weigh 130 so I ordered the small. Fit fine, but the bust area is meant for well-endowed women. I'm a 36B and there was way too much extra fabric and it sat awkwardly on my chest. I wouldn't order this unless you're a C cup or bigger. Also the plastic on the straps on the back really dug into my shoulder blades and probably would have bothered me if I was wearing it all day, and I couldn't loosen them because of how poorly the bust area fit.<br /><br />I'll be sending it back, but I'm sure others would enjoy this suit. It seemed well made and of good quality."
3.0,OK.. kinda crappy quality... I'll never wear it now I see it in person
3.0,I was not aware that this is made in China. It was not disclosed!
3.0,"this shoe is low cut across the toes. I bought a half size larger than what I normally wear because i have a wide foot. The shoe was still too small ,and tight. I went ahead and bought a shoe stretcher so I could wear it."
3.0,"Nice shirt I ordered 2xl for my son for Xmas it is way too big, it looks like a 4xl, I need to exchange for large since it is oversized."
3.0,"I like the dress, it just ran a little small in the shoulders. I will be returning for a bigger size."
3.0,The product itself is good. But the size seems to be a larger than expected
3.0,"I thought I was purchasing an official Dogeared piece, but it's a knock-off. Still cute but not high quality. I should've known when the price was that low! So buyer beware - this necklace is not a Dogeared piece of jewelry."
3.0,Not as warm as I hoped...
3.0,it was good but fragle
3.0,"I love the top but the bottoms are incredibly small.  I am smaller on top and bigger on the bottom, but even still, the bottoms are so small!  Wish I could have the small top and medium (or possibly large) bottoms, but it's a set.  Still an affordable price though so I don't mind, I'll keep the top."
3.0,Not a bad quality..but it's definitely not real leather!
3.0,I absolutely love this bracelet.
3.0,Really cute. Kind of a weird material. But great for the price.
3.0,Way way too small. Order a size or two down.
3.0,Pretty shoes but a bow fell off right out the box. I was able to tack it back on and also reinforced the other one.
3.0,"Nice pants, maybe I should have gotten a bigger size."
3.0,The strength seemed a little stronger than ordered.  Hinges are a bit stiff.  Appearance very nice.  Useful for failing eyesight.
3.0,"My son had broke my other glasses, and these were the next closest pair to the look/model only down side, they did not sit even. The frame was slightly bent, though I dont believe it is from shipping, but manufacturer error."
3.0,"I received the  wrong  color, but the dress is nice."
3.0,with arthritis they are hard to get over my head..and kindof snug
3.0,"My bad for clicking the wrong color, but maybe update the size chain you’re sending? I was expecting 18.5 inches, and this chain is practically a choker. False advertisement. Make sure you have a chain you can put this on if you buy, the one It comes with is definitely not what they are showing in the pictures."
3.0,Bought for the wife. Zero stretchiness to the shorts. Unflattering fit. Stars and stripes pattern doesn't show well either. Fit was true to size though.  Returned.
3.0,"Love these pants’ fit, material, comfort, and design.<br />However, the pants I got are a COMPLETELY different blue from the photo, and I got these to match a specific top and I can’t use it for that purpose."
3.0,"Runs small. And is not a stretchy material. Loved the softness of the material, like an old broken in tshirt. And the cuffed sleeve was a nice touch. Just runs small unfortunately."
3.0,"Good make, It is just too short."
3.0,"The base dress is good, but I have a C cup and it acts as like a sports bra/binder. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE HIGHER THAN A B CUP.<br /><br />The apron is GARBAGE, better to make a better one yourself, and the collar is misaligned when sewn on, so you have to resew it as well. You can reuse the apron material as more as frill if you want to reuse fabric, but that's basically it,"
3.0,They are really cute! I expected them to be bigger though 😀
3.0,It’s thin and cheaply made.
3.0,Belt didn't arrive
3.0,Slightly smaller than I usually wear. Would order one size larger. Good quality shirt though. I am just going to wear it open with t underneath.
3.0,"The arms are so huge! The rest is fine, but why are the arms made so huge?!"
3.0,the puff sleeves are a bit tight around my arms and had to sow the chest area for it being to big in the chest but fits everywhere else. It’s a very pretty dress other wise!
3.0,"They're ok. When I saw the &#34;memory foam&#34; for the sole I thought &#34;oh yeah!&#34; But actually it's pretty darn flat.<br />Not really feeling the memory foam, just assuming it's in there.  But ok for a quick kick on/off kind of slipper."
3.0,"I’m 5’6” and weigh 160, and I generally buy a size large. You can see in the side-by-side photo that a large in this dress is NOT the same. It didn’t fit terribly, per se, but one aspect of the dress that I loved was the loose, bloused out look of the top. It looks almost drop-waisted on the model. As you can see in my photo, the waistline is much higher.<br />I am now ordering a XXL (following the sizing chart provided), I’ve never ordered a XXL in my life, which shows you how off their sizing is. I’m interested to see how it fits, and will update soon!"
3.0,This dress is beautiful if you are not big busted.
3.0,Really cute but I feel like they are a little small. Super comfortable!
3.0,I recommend going up a size or 2. Not ideal for ppl with long legs. The become capris
3.0,Thought it would be sturdier very light weight
3.0,This dress is for a woman 5'5&#34; or shorter.
3.0,"Very disappointed overall.  Size is fine, material a bit rough especially around neck, just generally unhappy with item.  Had a fantastic version of this item about a year ago - material soft, warm, etc.  Unfortunately it met its end at the hands of the ER team who had to cut it off so that a tube could be inserted.  When I tried to reorder (when they finally let me go home) Amazon was all out of the item.  So. I did have something to compare the nightgown with . . . and the new one did not measure up!"
3.0,The glasses obscure my vision. There is a diffused quality to the viewed environment. Also the bottom of the frame on either side of my nose touches my face.
3.0,PRETTY TIGHT - DIDN'T KEEP MY FEET FROM SWELLING DURING TRAVEL - LIKE REGULAR HOSPITAL TYPE COMPRESSION STOCKING DO.
3.0,"The pjs came in and I was so excited to receive them. However, when opening it I noticed right away that the print was worn off in some areas and was very disappointed to see that it being a Disney set of pjs I would have hoped to see a better quality for the price. Overall the pjs are true to size and feel good. Just wish it could have been a little softer and the print not looking so worn off like it is."
3.0,"I would definitely order a size up if I ordered again. it's stretchy when you stand up, but for sitting, the material rides up and you are constantly pulling it down."
3.0,"Returning them too small, i’m probably getting a size larger."
3.0,"Fabric was pretty good. Not thin or see through but not stiff or itchy either. Really liked this piece but proportions a bit off. The crotch was long and the legs were just way too short. I’m 5’6” and 140 and purchased a medium. If you’re more petite, it will be nice summer fit, easy to dress up or down."
3.0,This product did not have a lot of beads when a large woman puts it on it's too many gaps.
3.0,"Very neat, fits well and it doesn't matter which side you wear it on, because back and front is identical! However, there was a problem with having an extra chain link which can hurt you, if you're not careful! Great look-alike to the key in Coraline... Looks exactly as shown and very long chain and easy to fasten!"
3.0,Kind of lightweight and fringe less dense than I like. Nice colors though!
3.0,"This cap is listed as &#34;Belfry Street Groby - Wool Newsboy Cap&#34;, so I expected a 100% wool product.  The tag in the cap shows it to be a wool/poly blend.  I believe the listing was somewhat misleading.  Otherwise, I'm pleased with the product.  It looks good, fits well, and seems well constructed."
3.0,I bought these for work use only. I’m in the construction industry. After about 4 months of use the wood on both sides broke off. All though I only had them for 4 months I would say I still got good use out of them. I would probably buy another pair because the design and look of these glasses are nice overall. These are good for work purposes since they aren’t super expensive.
3.0,"The bows fell off as soon as I washed them. I tied them back on but they’re not as cute now, doesn’t look the same. Other than that they are really soft."
3.0,Cute tho
3.0,Really pretty but runs small
3.0,Decent shirt but it's a little short and runs a tad small.
3.0,These earrings were one of the only sterling silver earrings that did not irritate my nest pierced cartilage. The only downside is that one of them broke easily. The three pair were worth the price for the quality.
3.0,"Nice.  Somewhat tight in the arms (2XL).  Also the color is not as dark as in the photo.  Actually, it was much lighter.  I probably would not order again from this company."
3.0,"Product arrived as pictured, but I'd avoid these flats if you have wide feet."
3.0,It's looks good but I am just fine with that
3.0,"They are nice, but it fits me small. I wish it was a little bigger"
3.0,This item is okay. It was too large for me.
3.0,"Love the quality of the hat, it's just not large enough. I wear a 7-5/8 to 7-3/4 and i have to have it on the last hole to even fit. I still wear it anyway though"
3.0,It was okay....
3.0,The size is smaller than normal. I received shirts from other places and matched them up and it was smaller.
3.0,These shirts were nice to have after the wedding. But the reason for just 3 stars is because the writing on the hubby t shirt was extremely faded. So I had to mess with calling amazon and getting a refund to order another set for our honeymoon!
3.0,"I bought these and two other similar items, one closed at the toe, and the other just two velcro'd straps across the foot, at the same time.  I also ordered an orthotic for plantar fascitis.  I used it in the closed shoe, and it fit perfectly.  Someone commented that these slippers/shoes looked too small for me.  I thought it was because they were wide and I was slipping forward.  However, a few days later I took the orthotic out of the other shoe and put it in these.  Well.  The orthotic is almost an inch longer than these shoes.  So, beware of the sizing provided, it's pretty far off.  Oh, the other shoes are Propet brand, so, their sizing can be considered pretty standard.<br /><br />They are open at the sides and toes, so don't give any support.  The heel has an adjustable strap, although I'm not sure what the purpose is.  They're not terrible for what they are, but the sizing is way off.  Order large."
3.0,Seems like a decent shoe. Would recommend socks with the shoe as if rubbed my daughter’s toes when worn without. Has withstood one wash in matching already.
3.0,These are canvas and the toes do not hold up for very long especially with rowdy 2 year olds.<br />The velcro strap is very sturdy and stays in place
3.0,"Had to send back because it got creased in the box on the way here, and no matter how I tried, I could not get the crease out."
3.0,Backs didn't fit well and one was bent but I have extra backs anyways.  Decent for price
3.0,Cute but they are very flat and thin. I wanted something thicker decided to return.
3.0,"I couldn’t make this work for me as intended. The hook stood up high enough to sometimes interfere with strings, I couldn’t shorten the holding height enough to keep any tension on it so the hook wouldn’t flop around...HOWEVER, I really liked the embroidered part of the strap and it finally dawned on me that if I just cut the string and removed the hook and plate I could tie off the ends and use it as a regular strap. I did.t want to cut off the excess (in case it needs to be resized for someone else) so I did hitch knots back up the string (macrame style) to get rid of the tails. I made a small loop for the bottom button so I can slip it on and off.  This is working well enough that I would buy it again, but I only gave 3 stars because it didn’t work as intended"
3.0,"This watch has its good and bad points. Overall, it is definitely well worth the few dollars you'll pay for it. It keeps great time, and isn't that really the main function you want in a watch? If not, and looks is your main function, this watch surprisingly delivers there, too. From any distance, this watch could easily be mistaken for an actual expensive name-brand piece. It's a Chinese made watch, made with a quality Japanese Miyota movement. One thing I don't like is the uni-directional bezel. It's chrome-plated plastic (or at least, it feels and looks like it), only has 60-clicks, and worst of all, it is very loose. Once set, it reverse rotates a lot before being caught by the cog. It is loose, compared to any other rotating bezel I've owned or seen. The band is rolled flat steel. It has three adjuster holes (nice!) and a dual side-button release clasp. Nothing great, but certainly not a bad band. Better than most Chinese metal watch bands, that's for sure. It's even better than some metal bands I've seen on brands such as Fossil and Diesel. Luminous dial hands. The back states, &#34;Water Resistant,&#34; but does not show a rating. A little research shows 30m, but with a pop-on case back, I certainly wouldn't risk this watch in any water situation beyond light rain. For an inexpensive watch, this one is definitely higher quality than most Chinese-made pieces. It's heavier, thus feels a bit tougher, has a better band than most, has working day and date, and looks great. Just don't mistake this for a Seiko or a Citizen. It's not near that caliber of quality. But, for the price, you're definitley getting your money's worth."
3.0,Can’t comment
3.0,"it got here in the time frame, the end of the time frame. pay attention if it is coming from overseas. it's snug. it has a fleece lining which is nice, but it doesn't stretch like knit does and there were one or two places where the color changed on the gloves that the yarn was loose"
3.0,I bought these thinking they would be nice on an adult but quickly looked like I was a teenager who was in an emo type style or channeling my inner Avril Lavigne. A bit too bulky for me but seems like great material that will last a while for the right outfit and person rocking these.
3.0,"I purchased a medium/large, and it was way too big .<br />It feels like a xl rather than  m/l .  I even bought spacers to reduce size. Still to big ! Waste of money."
3.0,"The shirt is made out of polyester.  It does fit well and is a nice blouse, just falsely advertised the material"
3.0,Bra way too small. Buttom fits very nicely.
3.0,"Nice glasses, but kinda small.  Ended up giving them to my kids. I will say, for the money, good little glasses, as the box, case, glass wipe, etc were all first class. If these were bigger for adults, they would be a 5/5 and a steal to buy."
3.0,Exposed Velcro used for closer on the back of the hat grabs hair or fibers from clothing that comes in contact.
3.0,"I am not sure what is considered an XL.  I wear a hat size of 7.5, and these squeeze your head.  Although I like the functionality ( for me, fly fishing ), the long term use would not be recommended.  I don't see myself reading a book for hours with these pinching my eyeballs out.<br /><br />Curious if others feel the same here"
3.0,Cute but disappointed the lenses are not as colored as they appear to be in the picture. There is also no little black spots on the lenses. The lenses are a VERY slight purple hue.
3.0,It's okay. Cheap accessories are for little people.
3.0,These are sparkly and pretty but I ordered a larger size.<br />So disappointed!
3.0,These necklaces are cute and my granddaughter was happy to wear them until she went to remove her necklace. Several strands of hair got caught in the necklace. I had to break the hair that was caught in the chain to remove the necklace. She does not want to try wearing the second necklace.
3.0,"This shirt is super cute! It's tight on the breast and body but is also flattering , will look great with a cardigan."
3.0,"It fits a little bigger than I’d like and is kinda frumpy looking, but it works for what I needed it for!"
3.0,"The rose gold love knot earrings are very thin and flimsy.  The online photo is deceptive when it comes to size., as the earrings are exceptionally thin.  One plastic back secured an earring, while the other back was much looser.  I am returning them.  Thank goodness , I can.  Thank you, Amazon for making them easy to return."
3.0,"I loved these ear rings , but they were way too big for me  , I wish they were smaller"
3.0,ok watch. Big! Not like photo so much.
3.0,Very cute top and very comfortable. Only problem is it is not sweat proof. Any sweat under my arm pits shoes up so easily.
3.0,My daughter loves it but the charm fell off after one day!!!
3.0,The engraved lettering is off centered.  But the metal is good quality.
3.0,Not so much for men returned for that reasonm
3.0,Love them. Soft and comfortable. Not see through. Stitching is starting to come undone on bottom.
3.0,So disappointed in the sizing. I was looking forward to comfy oversized but this is just silly sizing.  A medium is more like a 2 XL.
3.0,I really like the fit.. And they really trim your belly.. Lol
3.0,"I returned these as the cut was odd; the fit a little too loose.<br />I also got the 'leoprad print', which had a better fit. Both are size S. I am a 4 or Petite 6, generally."
3.0,"Shipping on this came FAST...got it in 5 days from order date.  Purse is super cute!  Looks nice, coffee color is perfect and looks like I paid more than I did.  Looks and feels like leather.<br /><br />Cons: Zippers seem a little flimsy and the smell...smells like it was soaked in urine??  Ugh...I am currently airing it out and praying that it goes away as quickly as others said.  Apparently this is known by the manufacturer because a note was included with the purse with different ways we can rid the purse of the odor.  One method was to put in our air vents, lol.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy...I'm anxious to start using my new purse!<br /><br />Edited to add:  weeks after purchasing, this purse STILL smells like a dead animal.  I've tried everything to air it out, to no avail.  Taking off a star because no matter how nice a purse looks, it shouldn't smell like you pulled it out of a dumpster.  :("
3.0,They are okay. Thinner  than I thought they would be.
3.0,"cheap plastic, hinges need grease, look a bit off. that being said i didnt pay much for them, expect something you would find on the sunglasses rack in a 7/11."
3.0,"Fit is good, sizing is accurate, very sold, but color is off. I got the yellow. It looks more like a golden cool shade in the picture, but when I received it it’s more of a sunshine yellow/orange warm in color. I’m going to keep it only bc I got it during a lightening deal, other wise if I paid fill prize I would return."
3.0,"I would order 2 sizes up if you order this, it is a cheaply made product but for the price, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Abit big but can hold iPhone and keys with lipstick etc so it's worth the price.
3.0,the top ball is not large enough but its awefully pretty
3.0,But I hate the sleeves.Have not work it because I thought the sleeves were pure black but they are sheer
3.0,its a little short
3.0,Somewhat small but nice to use comfortable.
3.0,I think this would work better for older kids. My 6 year old had a hard time keeping it up for even 5min
3.0,Yellow is mustard colored. Not as pictured but a hassle to return
3.0,"Beware of shrinking even after washing as instructed. Otherwise, I love this kaftan!"
3.0,"Cute dress, great that it has pockets, comfortable, but the material is cheap and started to degrade after half a dozen washes and now has a hole in the fabric itself that can't be patch. Given durability wouldn't spend more than $15 on this dress"
3.0,"This is a fine t-shirt dress, but it's nothing special.  I ended up sending it back because I need more pieces in my wardrobe that are better than just okay."
3.0,"Colors are cute, but the fabric is scratchy, even after washing a couple of times"
3.0,"Buenas. El reloj es dificl de leer debido a su forma. Adicionalmente venia detenido, se tuvo que cambiar la bateria."
3.0,I haven't even worn them yet and they are already starting to fall apart.
3.0,It's a bit smaller than I was expecting
3.0,"I think these are super cute and my daughter loves them. However, she has worn them for about a week and the stitching on one boot is already coming loose and fraying."
3.0,I love the turtle but the bar made my ear swell and hurt.
3.0,A bit large especially around the ankles.
3.0,"This slip-on platform wedge fits perfectly and has a timeless look. The cork wedge looks great. The PU leather strap has snake-skin embossing. As PU leather goes it's not bad, but it doesn't pass for genuine leather up close. They are a good buy as long as you are ok with that."
3.0,"I should have known better than to try to order sunglasses online without being able to try them on. I love the style and wanted affordable polarized sunglasses that I wouldn’t be sad about if they got banged up while doing field work. These unfortunate are way too narrow for my face and they squeeze my temples.<br /><br />Sizing, best for teens or people with very narrow faces. They are cute, I wish they were just a little wider!"
3.0,The dress is cute but the arms of the ruffle sleeve and very tight and pinch into my arms.
3.0,Very thin material and the v-neck is very low. The color is brighter than the picture.
3.0,order size bigger
3.0,Way too small but it is as is posted online.  This shirt is definitely for a petite and thin person.  I am normally a size 10-12 but this is not even close the shoulders and arms incredibly tight.
3.0,"This bag is exactly what I wanted; however after months of use, the inner lining is ripping away and the shoulder strap completely ripped off the side of the bag. The price is great, and I think I have gotten my money's worth."
3.0,"Beautiful fabric, but proportions were wrong for my body shape. The torso of this dress was too long for me."
3.0,$25 jus needed it 4 an all white party job well done
3.0,"I ordered a Large as am an 8 in jeans however it was too small around the leg area, if you are curvy and are used to wearing strechy jeans and pants this is not for you (they dont have anything bigger than a L&#34;, the material is not a strechy material at all. They are really cute though, well made, just wish I could have worn them."
3.0,I am 5 10 150lb and I got a medium it fits but aliterate to small so I might get a large next time
3.0,No big deal but keeps excellent time
3.0,"Beautiful.  The material is very heavy which would make it good for winter, but way too hot for summer.  I like it, but the fabric is not veristal enough for me to keep it.  I will be returning it."
3.0,Granddaughter wore it for 1 day and then it broke.  The necklace is nice but I guess it really is not for a 2 yr old.
3.0,"This a nice helmet and it looks awesome but there a few flaws that I just couldn't over see.<br /><br />1. As a person who has to wear glasses to see the sun shield was to close to my face and could not be used while wearing glasses. It could either use the sun shield be comply blind, or wear my glasses and be blinded by the setting sun.<br /><br />2. Going over speeds of 40 MPH there is a pronounced whistle in the helmet that can quickly become annoying. I recommend using ear plugs with this helmet.<br /><br />3. I wish GLX had spent the few extra pennies to put an anti-fog coating on the helmet visor. This helmet dogs up something terrible on colder mornings when stopped, infact I have to leave the helmet visor slightly open at all times.<br /><br />For the price it's not a bad helmet if you can get plastic it's flaws, but if you wear glasses I HIGHLY recomend the Torc T-27 modular design."
3.0,Very pretty but they snag clothing
3.0,"The vest came in, a little snub for its size, but not too much for me.  Like advertised, it holds a lot of stuff.  We were hoping that the would be light enough to wear in all seasons.  But it is somewhat warm.  So it's ood for fall, winter and spring, but probably not so much in the summer."
3.0,"Honestly, I expected more from these glasses. I was hoping that they would stop me from not wanting to drive at night but I can't use them for driving at all. I even tried them over my glasses but... I got the same result. They look nice on and I consider them just another pair of sunglasses for use on a low sun day. For whatever reason, they blur things a bit. As much as I wanted to like them for driving; I can't give them that. I'll use them on the boat but not on the road. They do come in a top quality triangle black case that I love with a screwdriver key chain, cleaning cloth and a protective bag if you want to just throw them in your beach bag.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for evaluation purposes. The details of my review are my opinion and my opinion only. Take what you will from it and make your own purchasing decision. I will say that I'm 52 and can no longer wear contacts but these may work properly with younger people with better vision than myself."
3.0,"Title says it all. I ordered based on the size chart, and they're pretty snug. They also hit much higher on my iliac than I'd prefer, and the stitching doesn't stretch with the fabric the way a properly surged stitch would."
3.0,This is not so great as I expected
3.0,"I bought these for my husband I'm April and had to buy a new pair by june because the sole had already peeled back from the bottom of the shoe. That being said, my husband did find these very comfortable and enjoys wearing them. They are thin so his feet dont sweat to much. And the second pair has held up."
3.0,It is cute and it fits nice. It took over a month and half to get the sweater!
3.0,This color is really nice. its much brighter than the picture. not tan not pink but in the middle of those 2.  definetely fit small. I would have liked it to be a little longer. It comes just at if not slightly above my belt line. nice for work.
3.0,Not the quality I had hoped for.  Silver earrings turned after just 1 use.  Have not opened the gold ones.  Posts quite large and hurt my ears.  But earrings are a nice size and weight.
3.0,"For the Harry Potter fan,for sure! kinda feel apart soon after we received it. But it's cute!"
3.0,"I took measurements & ordered the smallest size. Was still too big. Doesn’t feel much different than normal socks. They probably do what they are intended to for bigger feet/legs. I just didn’t get much of the “compression” feel. If they offered a smaller size I would definitely order the product again. Product seemed to be good quality and comfortable.<br /><br />For reference purposes-(female) I’m 5’8, 160lbs, 8 1/2 (Wide) shoe, can fit wide calf (sometimes)"
3.0,"These shoes are perfect, however, they run abit large."
3.0,"I love the size of this umbrella.  My household’s reigning “compact” is about 12 inches, which means it stick up out of any umbrella/water bottle pockets on my handbag.<br /><br />The materials seem good, though I’m wondering about durability with an umbrella that has the ribs set up to fold a few times to get so compact.  Opening is a dream even without a magic “launch” button*, but once you collapse it, it’s a mess of floppy ribs akimbo and tons of fabric that is not so happy to fold back into a neat compact shape with ease.  Now I can sit down and methodically do it at home, after letting it dry, open.  It’s not so tough when you can dedicate a couple of uninterrupted minutes.  But if I’m on the way to an appointment, I may just have to hold onto it because there’s no way I’m fitting it as is into the narrowish external pocket on my bag – and it kind of looks a mess.<br /><br />So really, this is about weighing the pros and cons of a less “compact” compact umbrella vs. this Ordora design.  I haven’t even really made my mind up about my ultimate preference  – yet.  There are lots of mildly rainy days in Kentucky that it just doesn’t turn out to be wet enough that I want to be bothered opening and closing ANY umbrella, in which case this one is good, bulk free insurance.  If true cats and dogs are on the menu, however, I’d rather be carrying one that comes to heel fairly easily, and this ain’t that.<br /><br />* I’m flagging the part about “upgraded button (to) protect the finger” in the ad copy.  It’s just a raised bit around the join of the ribs and it doesn’t mean the umbrella is automatic.  Actually I don’t mind – it’s smooth, easy, and I may even prefer it to the (BANG!) automatic launch, but am mentioning as this part of the product description may be confusing to some."
3.0,Just beautiful!!!! I did have a problem though with all the blue dye stuff that was put all over it. When I opened the package naturally I dumped the keychain out the bag into my lap. Well I had a very light pink skirt on and the blue dye powder whatever got all over it and ruined it. Not too happy about that. I rinsed it off really good and it cleaned up nicely (should have been done before shipping perhaps) and now its on my truck keys and I get so many compliments on it. I recommend but also recommend open with caution !!! Lol it could be messy...
3.0,This is very  flimsy and not as nice as the picture.  I wouldn't buy again for the price.
3.0,Didnt fit as expected.
3.0,This does protect from sun but you cannot see clearly out of it. So dont use when you need to see clearly. But good enough to provide sun shade. Not sure if it blocks any uv rays though.
3.0,The big handle broke and the bag is heavy. Other than that​ it's good.
3.0,I have no complaints except it didn't work for me. I returned and it was free to return it and they gave me my money back - no questions asked. I think different people snore for different reasons and this might help some people so it is worth a shot. Maybe it will work for you.
3.0,runs a little small and the straps are very skinny
3.0,"Love the look and feel but is very small for a 5x it fits as a US 1X.  Color is awesome, and it is as soft as I wanted to be but my big self cannot wear it. Quite disappointed.  Still gave 3 star because the jacket color wise and make is great. Size just not right."
3.0,Unfortunately arrived with a small hole in fabric I could not fix or cover which was even more disappointing  because I loved fit
3.0,Not the type of material I was expecting...looks more like halloween costume
3.0,its ok - fit good.
3.0,fabric was great and so was price
3.0,Se sale el color de la camiseta en poco tiempo.
3.0,oooook
3.0,"Wasn't exactly what I expected (I'm returning it), and the sizes definitely run large so order a size down!"
3.0,"Customer service from the Co. Is great, they checked in a few times. The earring is small & very cute. Unfortunately, I had to return mine bc my ears are sensitive & it made my ear red:itchy."
3.0,Maybe these are for a bigger head because the ears don’t line up right. 🤣
3.0,"Ok for the price, faded after some use."
3.0,Great handy like that you can control the speed not cordless
3.0,"The pads are a nice shape under clothes, but a little too thick for my taste since I prefer a little lift that is very natural looking.  However the real downside is the additional shipping cost from the vendor--too much!"
3.0,"I got these for my husband, but he didn't want to ""model them,"" therefore, I did for the review. The pros are they are polarized, the lenses are easy to see through, and they come with a nice case. The fit is not my favorite. They stick out from the face a bit. I prefer a more curved look and feel. The nose piece is ok but not the most comfortable. We will keep them and use them but just ok for style and comfort."
3.0,"This Bostanten leather handbag is nice and roomy and the leather is good quality.  The zippers are sometimes a bit difficult to operate, the links that hold the zipper pull have to be exactly right and straight in order for them to pull properly.  I noticed just the other day that the strap that is permanently attached to the bag has been applied inside out.  The seams are on the outside/topside and the finished side is underneath.  I didn't notice it before, but now that I know it's very obvious and bothersome.  The photos all show the strap just as mine is, but it's really upside down.  Not sure why they finished it this way."
3.0,"I really wanted to live this dress. I bought the black print with flowers and was disappointed the inside of the material was white. This was intended to be worn to a wedding but it looked way too casual when inside of the dress showed, which was kind of impossible to prevent with the slit."
3.0,"I recently went to Mexico and got a free adjustable bead bracelet I felt in love with.  It was very simple, pastel colors beads and line. This bracelets has better quality line BUT the gold beads and the gold / crystal charms gets tarnished very fast. If they would only use beads this would be a PERFECT product and would last for a long time.<br />Please consider."
3.0,I really wanted to like the swimsuit but it fit really weird...  Maybe it would fit someone with a really really short torso
3.0,"Cheap, brow bar slides and is not evenly attached - but did just fine for a costume and occasional wear."
3.0,"Arm pits big, but fine for boys/young men still growing.  Looks good and feels good."
3.0,One arrived broken. The other worked as claimed. They look cool but are very heavy for cuff links ( according to my husband). I will be returning them.
3.0,After using the belt a few times they started shredding.
3.0,The part with the elastic was loose. Had to get it fixed. Fits perfect now.
3.0,The color is beautiful and I like the fit but this is not like a cotton sweatshirt material. It’s synthetic to the touch and a little shinier than cotton. The photo looks different than what I received.
3.0,Turn color very quick
3.0,cute but way smaller
3.0,"They were fine for a while but did not hold up to an 8-year-old's abuse.  They frayed and puffed out, became separated from the core cord within a few weeks.  That said, my son is a terrible shoe-tier right now so these would have to stand up to being untied and trampled.  But in short, when I had to replace these I went with another brand."
3.0,It’s kind of cheap but for the price it’s a great little collectible.
3.0,"it is beautiful, but it doesn't sit well on the ear..and if you tight it harder it hurt after a few minutes"
3.0,Its ok. I thought it'd be nicer
3.0,"I expected to like this skirt very much, but alas it looks much better on line than in person. The material (polyester) and washed-out colors just didn't do it for me. It also has complicated care instructions compared to most of my clothing. On the plus side, the return process was easy and efficient."
3.0,"Luv the color of the shirt and how low it hangs, wish it was a tad bit looser though, being big chested (38DD) i didn't want this shirt to cling to my chest too much. This material is light but somewhat makes me perspire more on a warm day."
3.0,"The slippers seem nice but when looking at them closely, several flaws/imperfections can be seen.<br />The fuzz was stiff in several areas and I think that is due to some adhesive.<br />The soles are slightly dirty on some areas and the adhesive is seen all around the soles.<br />The hardware/buckle looks scratched and not clean and clear.<br />These slippers do not reflect a  $20 to $30 price range.<br />I ordered a size 8-9 which is approx 10 inches long.<br />The slippers are thick and comfortable but I am not certain about their durability.<br />Due to the comfort, I give it three stars, but the quality is one star."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2c709b821f79dbc76b6469d6d89faf7f]] All while it is package very nice and is a good product.. I ordered 1/2"" and was sent 7/16"". That was my only problem.  In video it shows 1/2"" silicone plug next to the 7/16"" tunnel I was sent..."
3.0,"One size does not fit all! That's just another way of saying ""we make just one size""! They slip down below my heals. They come up just above my ankles which ""almost"" justifies the description of ""Women Above Ankle""; not any higher as the photo shows. I'm pulling up on them a lot! Because these are the colors I want, I'll keep them and deal with the slipping. My pants cover the lack of height. Because I had hoped to have the ones in the photo, I AM disappointed. Buyer be Aware!"
3.0,Good quality but mine bulges where the pockets are and makes it unflattering. It looks fine if I kee my hands in my pocket but that’s not always possible.
3.0,Took a long time to arrive and it looks like a toy.  It was for my daughter and I was a little embarrassed to give it to her. But she seemed to like it.
3.0,Served the purpose but not the best ones for us
3.0,It has a nice material warm feel but the design is not as detailed as it looks in the picture.. Strangely still like it...
3.0,"it's just a headband with a little bit of lace covering, it doesn't cover as much of the face as it shows in the picture."
3.0,"I ordered F1 grey color.  In the photo, it shows grey and pink front with peach/orange and green sleeves.  The one I got has a tan sleeve instead of the peach/orange.  I still like it but with the grey, it’s not as fun and colorful as I wanted."
3.0,Very nice coat but within 60 days the zipper broke . Just a little to late to return !
3.0,Warning May see bits and pieces through material but overall cute
3.0,"They help protect your eyes somewhat, but they’re not polarized. The sticker on one of the sides has started to peel off."
3.0,"Young man down low, old man up at the waist"
3.0,"Material is itchy with hardly and stretch, also came with a snag in them, and they make it difficult to return. Do haven't returned yet but plan on it."
3.0,"Fit and work for lower shoes, just wish they were a bit thicker"
3.0,"The wallet is attractive. However, it is so stiff that I have trouble opening the coin section, which is extremely small. Otherwise, a good product."
3.0,"The image is very clear, the quality is good, fit is a bit tight and although it does stretch, it is a snug fit and does not stretch easily.  May return for a large because feels very snug."
3.0,I bought these for the guys in the mold shop.  The price was about the same as my old supplier.  These just were very thin and easy to make holes in them.  They asked me to go back to the old brand.
3.0,Probably okay for the price but was looking for something more.
3.0,"Cool design, but I have big big toes, yeah you read that right... they scratch open the ends. I now decidedly require tough reinforced underfootwear"
3.0,"It runs very small. It’s beautiful, but had to give it away after washing it."
3.0,Sweet jewelry for a charm necklace.
3.0,"I like it but the balls on the neckline were only on the back half, none on the front!"
3.0,"I loved the color and the material. I normally wear a 1X, sometimes a 2X or an 18 in women's clothes. I ordered a size up and it was still too tight across the bust and the back."
3.0,"Very tiny... Not as impressed as I had hoped to be,"
3.0,"It's just ok, the keyhole top was sown oddly and didn't lay right so i couldn't wear it"
3.0,This are a lot smaller than my other 2 gauge plugs. Some fall out.
3.0,"I guess I was in one of those moods when I ordered this blouse.  I would love it to look like the picture, but in reality, on me, I look like a clown. This top is for a young girl/woman's body.  If my boobs were where they were 20 years ago the seem would fall in the right place, but, unfortunately it cuts right across the middle of my chest.  Not a good look.  The flare on the arms are a little bit too exaggerated and the body looks like a tent on me. I will say, the fabric and feel is quality, but, it's just kinda a strange look.  I'm sure this will look very hip on a girl that has the look of the model wearing it in the picture and that's about it."
3.0,"It’s a great shirt, the material is really weird and the neck is stretched out. It’s not like a normal cotton t shirt style"
3.0,"I don’t know how to rate this shoe as far as fit because it is a tad long but also a bit narrow around the arch. I’m guessing this is because it does not have enough material to compensate my arch but then it is big around the ankles<br />The style is not very attractive but it is very comfortable. I don’t think they will be comfortable to wear so I will return them and contemplate sizing down.<br />I am usually between 8.5 to 9, and I need wide shoes most of the time, especially when it’s anything other than a sneaker."
3.0,"The structure of the dress is pretty, and fits pretty well. It's a midi dress. But the material felt cheap and felt almost see through. If those aren't deal breakers then it could still be a good purchase."
3.0,"There's nothing wrong with the quality, but it really isn't unisex. The fabric portion of the mask is really big. Perfect for a man's face, but it's not adjustable to tighten the fabric as needed to fit a woman's. Wish it was, I love hollow knight!"
3.0,I struggle to put these on I even had my hubby help I just wish it wasn't so small
3.0,"First, I wish it looked like the photo in the rendering. There are two styles shown in the product photos, so I wasn't sure how the actual product would look.<br /><br />The finish isn't very durable and began showing signs of wear after one day of use (doing office work, so nothing brutal).<br /><br />The fit, finish, and materials don't warrant a price above $15-20.<br /><br />I would recommend spending a little more for a higher quality ring."
3.0,bracelet broke in one day.
3.0,The bag looks fake in every way. I'm keeping it for traveling purposes. You get what you pay for.
3.0,Jacket isn't bad but if you leave your keys in your pocket  it ripped a large hole very flimsy lining other than that it's OK for the price
3.0,"Love this necklace and color, but broke after first time wearing."
3.0,"The socks were warm enough but ""wool"" rubbed off from socks after wearing only for a day or two.<br />Found them stuck to the feet and on the shoes.<br />Lack of reinforced toes' area, so don't think they will last long."
3.0,This is not a rhinestone sparkly shirt- sadly.
3.0,"Very low price is attractive! You do get 5 of them! Great under a T-shirt. Not enough support for larger breasts, or for running or working out. You could wear with shorts in summer or as a cozy bra in cool weather."
3.0,Holes in the arms are too long for my taste.
3.0,"This item is very nice for dogs, it is not what I thought I ordered.  It is my mistake that I thought it was for humans.  Fits my dog fine.  Not enough reflective material on the collar to be easily seen at night."
3.0,"I thought this sweater would be a tight warm  knit, but it was very loose making it look like it was going to stretch out easily.  With all the “openings,” it wasn’t going to keep me warm. Not sure if it was poorly made or that’s the loose look that was meant for. I returned since it’s not what I wanted"
3.0,"Recently gained some wait in the mid section and was hoping to find a dress that was still flattering for a wedding this month, The overall look and feel of the dress is good, however the bust area was pretty loose and the cap sleeves are somewhat constricted, when I lifted my arms the whole dress shifted up and I had to pull it back down. I’ll be returning this, just didn’t work out the way I had hoped :(<br />5’2 (ish) 130lbs 34b bust"
3.0,"I like pattern and the cut of this dress, but the fabric is extremely thin. Maybe with a different pattern, it would be better, but with the white fabric, a slip underneath is pretty much mandatory."
3.0,The stones are barely noticeable.<br />The clasp was already broke when received it. There was minor scratches on the pendent part.
3.0,The design is great and they are very comfortable but they tore the moment I put them on.
3.0,"I want to love this visor because it really is cute and the black and white color is so chic and versatile—doesn’t scream beach or vacation like some other visors do. But the fit is a little weird. The black band doesn’t lay flat on my head, even with the sweat band removed. Also the vendor should work with Amazon to get the package shipped in a box. It came in a bag, so the shape is a little messed up which is a bummer. I’m debating on returning, and possibly ordering another one to see if it will be shipped differently."
3.0,This dress fell short of my expectations. The material thick & stretches a little bit. I ordered a Small but should've gotten a medium but I still more than like would've returned it. The smalltalk me look a little wider than I am Lol but whatever. The style cute but I'm not a fan of the thick material.
3.0,"So I have a few different versions of these stick in bras. I love the idea and am searching for the best for my needs. These particular stick on’s are ok, and they are good for 1 time wear, ( maybe a second time) but the adhesive on the upper parts is wearing off. I only wore for a couple hours the first time, and by the 2nd wearing almost all the adhesive pulled off.  So for a 1 or 2 time wearing these are not bad. Just don’t expect to wear them multiple times."
3.0,"This skirt has wider stripes than it does in the photo. It is also much too large. I wear a size 14 pants so I bought an XL size skirt, but the front part of the waist falls off me and the skirt is very wide and not fitted.  The bow in front does not hold the skirt in place it just falls down. This has the potential to be a cute skirt, but the sizing and fit are just off."
3.0,This is a good dress for $15. The belt is very tacky and cheap but it’s removable so I used my own belt. The underskirt could be longer instead of just being till the knee
3.0,It fit good. i just find it a bit short. I read on a other view that she ordered a size up for d length but it still short. I will order again because i like the quality n d look.
3.0,Not as tight as I expected it to be. At a 36 DD and  a usual 10/12 I thought the large would be ik...but I should have gone with medium.
3.0,Nice except the top of the zipper is sharp and scratches me
3.0,I bought this for somebody else so I don't have any idea if it is good or not!
3.0,"I am 5’10”, 234lbs, 42C and pear-shaped, and ordered the XXL. My husband describes this as “Little House on the Prairie.” This did not look the same on me as it does on the model. Looked more like a nightgown. Returned, unfortunately."
3.0,Gave this as gift.  Worth the money spent.
3.0,"Very nice metal, but very tiny, hard to tell if they are soccer balls"
3.0,"The material is a bit stiff and has a picked in the shoulder. Washing it light help relax the knit but not sure. Plus, I was sent the wrong color. I ordered the Grey but was sent grey-1. Which is confusing naming so I'm not surprised there was a mix up."
3.0,"This shirt was a lot smaller than I anticipated. I bought a medium, and really could wear a large. I am not usually a large in size. It is thicker that I imagined it would be too and the sleeves are slightly shorter on my that I would like. Overall, cute. Just not exactly what I thought I was getting."
3.0,"Only washed once, but so far so good."
3.0,Didn't fit. Even bought larger size to wear socks in. Still too short. Gave them to my daughter.
3.0,These scratched easily in my bag and the inside of the arms are slowly bubbling up. The actual lenses weren't warped or distorted. They are definitely worth the cost because most sunglasses are cheaply made. Why pay more for the same style?<br /><br />I plan on buying a couple different styles just because they are inexpensive.
3.0,I like the shoes were too small
3.0,If you like really tight socks this will be good for you. It's too tight for me although perhaps in time it will loosen a bit. I wanted it tight and high so it wouldn't slide down so that much is working. But very hard to take off these super tight socks. Otherwise they are fine.
3.0,"Small fit, what was delivered was not what was pictured or as stated in the description.  Similar but NOT as described"
3.0,"Like purse. Received lots of comments and complements, but starting to fray already after a short time of use. Other than that good purchase."
3.0,It fits tight. i got it for one of my friends and it didn’t fit. i was disappointed but it still looked good.
3.0,I bought XL and they are too small....
3.0,"My goggles came in they look even better in person, the only problem I'm having is that the first time worse them they snapped quick I kept trying to fix it and it kept happening ??"
3.0,"This necklace is just ok. Costume jewelry quality though imo. It's not heavy at all, it's pretty thin so I do worry about it not holding up well, I've attached a pic of the left side of this which I'm guessing was messed up during the crafting process, and this was much more silver than I expected. The pics make it seem much darker than it actually is when it's VERY bright silver irl. I definitely think that, for what it is, it's overpriced. I will keep this though because despite my complaints about it I do still like it so I will eventually update when I've worn it a good amount and let y'all know how it holds up. But I don't see myself buying this again or recommending it to my friends."
3.0,Nice looking jacket. But xl fit more like a medium.
3.0,"Not sure about the point of my review since the variation i bought isn’t even on here anymore, but can you honestly call this tie dye?  it looks like someone took a bottle of spray paint and tried to spray limes all over. not to mention how DULL the colors look.<br />fabric was soft and comfortable and i really wanted to love it, but this looks like a sad die project gone wrong"
3.0,I wear it to work when I can't find anything else to put on. Not a bad buy but nothing spectacular
3.0,It was really cute and looked a lot like the picture. But it was missing a button and had stray strings all over it. I know how to sew and so I fixed it. This was just annoying and I would have been even more upset if I didn't have extra buttons laying around.
3.0,It sort of works but it is not very comfortable
3.0,Lenses look great and revived my favorite pair of glasses that are no longer produced. Shipping arrived in 2 days. Fit was perfect. The color visibility is really good. Would have been a five star product except for reflections or glares on the inner lenses when wearing them. It's tolerable but definitely noticeable. Obviously not the price of the original lenses so overall pleased.
3.0,It's a cute shirt..same as color shown in the picture. Material is very cheap feeling and it is see through.
3.0,the design is good but not good under the sun
3.0,The center zipper is easily broken the rest is very good material but the zipper is fragile and easily comes out
3.0,"It's beautiful, you can see through it. But it barely fits in length. It can't be worn as a dress unless you want to show everyone your business ahem. If you use it for swimwear cover up. Perfect and beautiful"
3.0,I bought an extra large and it was STILL too small. Misleading.
3.0,"I like the material but it runs super, super small."
3.0,Don’t size up this outfit runs large and is stretchy.
3.0,Cute and colorful but the fit is a little snug.
3.0,"Review the individual sizing chart (which was fairly accurate) - it’s not a true plus size pant (fits like a regular Womens sizing). The elastic waistband is a bit tight (I’m 5’ 5”, 160lb and ordered a large), but my legs would’ve been swimming in an xl. And it’s not a cropped pant, it’s the same as a regular pant length. But it is comfy and light (so a good summer work option) so I haven’t decided if I’ll be returning it"
3.0,"I had to buy a 2XL and even that even isn’t big enough. I’m right between a L and XL, more towards XL. I put a 3 Star down because it almost fits and I like the thumb holes, and I had to get a 2 XL."
3.0,would not buy again. its a tank top with a hood. not my cup of tea. dont know why i bought guess i thought it had sleeves and wasnt paying attention.. it fits ok. but i wore a shirt under it just for modesty sake.
3.0,"Way too small. I wear an xxl or xxl glove but even the 3x in these was tight enough to be uncomfortable. Like others have said, they're hard to get off since there's nothing to pull with. Seems at the end of the figures are fragile and I expect to see them come apart when I pull these off. Not super happy with this purchase, and certainly not the quality I would expect from Harley."
3.0,"Really pretty but way too short, even for my 22 year old daughter. Don't plan to wear this to church!"
3.0,small in the arms not wore yet hope will give a little.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Earring backs don't fit posts well. Zirconia ""jewels"" are loose in fitting and rattle. They look fine but are definitely not a quality product (about what I would expect for $7)."
3.0,"Only ok. They're definitely warm, no question. So, really, if that's what you're going for then look no further, but I find the fingers rather bulky and the cuffs are just loose. I would've preferred a ribbed cuff that slid under my coat sleeve. These get all bunched up and twisted. Oh well, they'll definitely do but I'll likely keep my eyes peeled."
3.0,"Cute, but runs large. I’m 118 lbs, 5’ 8”, 34C and the smallest size was just hanging off of me. Too much to get it tailored and still have it look good. Returned."
3.0,"After 1 wash, one of the seams started to unraveling up at a shoulder. It is unraveled enough that I cannot wear it. This is the 3rd piece from PattyBoutik to do this to me. It is only their really thick sweater items that seem to do this. I have loved all the PattyBoutik pieces I have purchased, but I have 2 items that I have only been able to wear once because of the seam coming undone so quickly.<br />This dress was very comfortable. It is very thick sweater material, and I like the lace up portion."
3.0,"The gloves look really nice and are well made, however they run really small. I am a medium sized person and I could barely get them on and off. When on, the rubber stretches when a fist is made."
3.0,"The image is gorgious, but the chain snapped just running it through my fingers. Also the image is covered in plastic NOT glass and it's not flush with the metal rim. It's VERY cheep quality."
3.0,"The top is fine, however the bottom is much smaller"
3.0,This top fits smaller than expected.
3.0,I am using this product for job interviews. This dress is looks professional.
3.0,"For starters, it was an expensive buy for three pairs of socks. Primarily, I bought these socks in the hopes of not bunching up. Alas, they did."
3.0,Unfortunately the earlobes are exactly in the right place for me and the material makes my face sweat
3.0,The pants fit way big and the shirt fits a little on the smaller size
3.0,"They fit true to size. However,  they aren't comfortable enough to walk decent distances."
3.0,I didn't like the fact that this sweatshirt didn't have any pockets
3.0,The ankle portion of the sock doens't fit well and slips off and down very easily.
3.0,"This is a cute dress you can also wear in the office.  Only con is thin material, just wear a slip.  I am 200lbs ,40 breast big hips. I have gotten many compliments."
3.0,"It probably works really great for credit and other cards; however, I wanted to use it as a photo holder.  The sleeves aren't crystal clear, so my photos aren't as visible as I would wish."
3.0,A completely flat bag.  Not a real-like handbag.  Nothing like the  com picture. Very flimsy and seems came apart with any weight or use.
3.0,Both web site and package say 5 pack briefs. Package only has 4!
3.0,Perfect watch for what I needed! It’s very durable! I wear it everyday and received many compliments. Some of the finish is beginning to wear off the silicone band though
3.0,If it was larger size; it would have seem more store bought. I needed 2xl.
3.0,"They were a little too short, but a nice variety. They do break easily but there is plenty."
3.0,I bought size M and it looks like S
3.0,The style was perfect but ordered the wrong size. I would have just replaced with the right size but the color was more of a salmon color and didn’t match the picture.
3.0,"Could be better. The quality isn’t the best, it shrinks after washing it."
3.0,Didn't care for material on the skirt part. Tight around waist
3.0,Gloves keep your hands and wrists warm. I received the wrong color.
3.0,I love the bottoms but the top is very small
3.0,"This belt is exactly as advertized, but the buckle is too thin/tinny for me. If that doesn't bother you, and it is lighter in weight than more solid looking/feeling buckles, obviously, then I recommend it."
3.0,Warm and supportive but run small
3.0,Some of the stitching wasn’t secure so I had to sew some of the seams.
3.0,Very tiny earrings
3.0,Bought these for my daughters because of the adjustability. The only problem is that they are very hard to adjust and remain looking bent up after a few times of adjusting to take on and off.
3.0,I bought these with the intention of being able to ground all day every day.  The adhesive on these is strong. But not strong enough the wear and tear tore one off in 2 weeks if it was a subscription it would be better because the straps do not last long with moisture. Outside of that the benefits were proper and to my expectations I was much less stressed and I will eventually buy another pair
3.0,"ok, because it kind of looks fake"
3.0,"They look nice, but linen creases easily."
3.0,Product was much bigger than I expected.  The product itself is very nice however I needed a hoop that was about 1/2 the size.
3.0,I wear it to cut grass. It help block the sun — No sun burn.
3.0,Sizes runs bigger than average.
3.0,"Have had several black pairs over the years.  Preferred them when they had rhinestones on the bows and straps as well but they did fall off after awhile so maybe that’s why they changed the design?<br /><br />They also seem thinner in width now, I had to get a size up and little toe is just hanging on (yes I have wide feet ugh)<br /><br />The blue is fun and shiny, will help jazz up my black dresses that I throw on most days (live in year round warm climate)"
3.0,I just wear for 2 days and it’s loose already and discolored.
3.0,"I want to love this watch band, but I can’t!!! My band was delivered very quickly but the metal pieces that fit into the Apple Watch were two difference sizes.  I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement right away.... but the second one has the same issue!! One side was larger again, and I wasn’t able to mix and match.  Such a disappointment in a nice looking yet expensive watch band. :(<br /><br />The band seems to be very good quality so I decided to contact the company directly and have a new one coming!"
3.0,"I bought this robe to wear after seeing hon Katherine Ryan wear a similar one in the Netflix series The Duchess. I wanted to love it but it ran a little small, was heavy, and made me very warm! So synthetic, it made me sweat and gave me no ventilation. Ultimately, I returned it but I loved the look!"
3.0,FIT WAY TO SMALL
3.0,"Was super short, i returned."
3.0,I am 125 lbs. and usually wear a small or xs. I purchased this dress in a small and it was too big. Overall a really cute dress!
3.0,Glasses fit well but did not lessen glare from oncoming headlights very well.
3.0,Really cute shirt but the ink is wearing off after only one wash & wear.
3.0,"If you have relatively wide calves, you can adjust the buckle on the side of each boot to a certain extent.  The pattern is super cute with the whales on it. They're a nice pick me up on rainy days."
3.0,"I went with the past reviews stating they ran small. I am usually a small so I ordered a medium and they are kinda baggy. They are also kinda see through. They are okay not bad, not great either."
3.0,The material is really thin. What I don't find appealing is the line(seam) that runs down the middle.  It isn't flattering.  I ordered a small and I found it to be big.  In the black the seam isn't as noticeable but I would of liked a lighter color.
3.0,"I used it as a dress for my nieces quince. It did the job, I think the lace is cheap and the top of the dress is very see through so you’ll need to wear a tank top underneath. I had a gift card so I wouldn’t pay full price for it. Overall many other cheaper options that I would go to over this dress"
3.0,Cute modest dress with elastic waist band and very stretchy material. Easily gets wrinkled and isn’t the best quality. Buttons open up around my chest it’s also the taupe dress is pretty see through so you need a slip I don’t know about the other colors.
3.0,I love this purse.  The only complaint I would have is the zipper is a little hard to open and the fact that they should<br />have incorporated hoops at each end of the purse for you to hook your straps into for carrying.  I ended up just<br />leaving the strap off and using the handles.  I do love the look and the room.
3.0,The size of the shoe itself fit great but the boot part falls down so often it's really frustrating. The boots are cute though
3.0,"Too orangey , didn't go with my other jewelry,  I guess it's all in the taste of the person For me it wasnt what i wanted"
3.0,The color of the stone is a little paler than the color shown in the picture.
3.0,"cheap plastic, not worth the money"
3.0,I like this dress. I ordered a L because I am between a M and L normally but the M would have fit better. It was a little big. I added a belt where the fabric changes to help with that. My complaint about the dress is the material wrinkles really easily so it does not look professional once you sit down and get back up from your desk.
3.0,My husband will probably re-order these in a larger size.
3.0,"I like it m. The print is beautiful and it’s ligjt and airy. However it’s see through. You will need a slip dress underneath. If you’re wearing it at the beach with swimsuit underneath, it should be fine."
3.0,"It is a cute design, and very good at securing thing within it, but its so thin that you can't fit a pringles csn within it. Ideal if you plan to only fill it with loose candy, but not much beyond that."
3.0,"Good workout leggings. The cut on the style was interesting , it fit my body well."
3.0,"Good design, just too heavy for travel. Returned"
3.0,"I like the fact that they are polarized.  They are great on our boat, but they are just a little bit on me so I worry they may fall off when I lean over.."
3.0,"These lots are going to be hit and miss. I got a nice variety of styles of sizes. I ordered 4-8t and it’s best suited for most 2-4 year olds. One pair was even labeled 12-24 months. I bought them for my 2.5 year old (after reading reviews). Most will fit her now, a couple are going to be too big. Overall, the colors are nice. Only one pair was stained/dirty, the others are fine. For the right price, I would order again. I paid .69 a pair and wouldn’t pay more than that for what you get here."
3.0,pic is much better than the actual garment.  runs big.  i returned it.
3.0,The hat itself was fine. But the Logo was glued on & not very well
3.0,"I've had these for a couple months now, I like the concept but it lacks quality when it comes to material used, the straps start to fail along with the clasp will not hold during the day."
3.0,"Hard to get into. Need someone to zip up and cinch in the back.<br /><br />Otherwise, a classy looking top."
3.0,"The glasses were stretched  causing them to come off, when reading."
3.0,Would've loved it if it were true to size. :(
3.0,"I think that this is a good gift for a child or young person, the quality isn’t all there for an adult. Thick chain, the turtle itself is smaller than a quarter. At far away glance looks like opal until you get closer and can see it’s artificial. Still cute"
3.0,"Satisfied, served the purpose it was bought gor."
3.0,I ordered a size larger than usual and it is still tight! I like the feel of the material extremely soft. Will not order again returning them.
3.0,It's bigger than I thought it would be.
3.0,Love the colors but the necklace is heavier than I was hoping for.
3.0,"As others have noted, there are quality control issues. I received mine with a chip in the lens and a weird warp to the top left frame. They do feel a bit flimsy as if I need to be very careful with them. Also I have a wide face and these fit/look OK on me but if your face is narrow they may be too big for you. Satisfactory for my purpose so I'm not returning them."
3.0,I did not like this dress at all.
3.0,Turned my finger green and tarnished within a week of wearing it.<br />Delivery was fast though!
3.0,"Didn’t realize this is printed on Gildan T Shirt but it is. I returned it. Gildan shorts are typically boxey, stiff, and uncomfortable."
3.0,"Good quality at a good price.  Not heavy duty, but will last a few months if you mare gentle with them.  Want better?  Pay 4X the cost elsewhere."
3.0,"wore out after only 6 washing and I only wore them on carpet with bare feet - never with shoes.  The heals had holes in them by the 7-10 time I wore them.<br />Super sad cuz I love the colors and wanted cozy, but the more I dried them, the more they shrunk.<br /><br />super duper cute though!!!"
3.0,"The shirt is okay.  However, it would've been better if It were the same blouse in the picture.  It runs a bit small...which would have been okay it had stretch."
3.0,Much thinner then thought to be. Also no way these are 80% cotton
3.0,"I read other reviews stating it runs small, so I ordered a size up. I wear large so I ordered X-large. Still a little small to me. It also zips on the opposite side, which leads me to believe this is a woman's jacket, even though it is labeled as a mens. That, to me, would explain it running small. I'll keep it anyway, I just needed something to wear walking back and forth between buildings at work, not something I'll be wearing 8 hours a day. I haven't worn it in the rain yet, so we'll see on that part. On the plus side, it's a nice looking jacket."
3.0,Dress was way too sheer.
3.0,Very difficult to put on.
3.0,"This is a very sweet bonnet . However, it runs small and looks like it was made in a rush and there are knots and loose threads randomly hanging.  It wasn't worth returning, so I fixed it myself."
3.0,It's cute just buy 2 sizes up! Doesn't fit to size!
3.0,"So I tried it on earlier today.  The person that commented that they didn't stick - well, I have no idea what the issue was, but that is not the problem I had.  These were INSANELY sticky.  If you need this for 1 special occasion, I would say it would work pretty darn well.  However, if you want to wear it often, I would not buy this.  Picture peeling off heavy duty duct tape every time you wore these - not really too painful, but you are stretching your skin like crazy every time you use them.  I actually think over time, they would cause droopier breasts because you are stretching the skin that much when you remove them.  So I guess I'll hold on to them for a special occasion (because can I really return them after they've been on my boobs?), but I'm going to find something else for the backless keyhole shirt I want to wear often."
3.0,"The dress fits very small, I would advise you follow the size guide posted closely and not assume it will fit large based on the look of the dress, or how similar dresses from different brands fit.  The main obstacle is the waist, it doesn't have a lot of give in it.<br /><br />The fabric did feel very nice quality, and the print has more colors than you can see in the picture, like dark blues and tans.  Wish it didn't run so small."
3.0,"My son is 2 and wears a 3T, but we ended up getting him a 4T, and am glad we did! There isn't much give in the waistband and if we would have gotten the smaller I feel like they would have been too tight on him.Potty training is a messy task and I will say they gave held up well in the wash so far!"
3.0,Ok these are definitely not toddler sizes.  I honestly don't remember if I ordered a toddler large or medium but either way they are way to big to fit my 6 year olds feet.  My husband jokingly said the slippers would fit me and I tried them on.  He definitely wasn't wrong.  I wear a size 7 and they fit me perfectly.  If you are an adult looking for comfy slippers I highly recommend them but do not buy if you want them for your child<br /><br />Im given 3 stars for the missleading size
3.0,I was rather disappointed in the brightness of colors !!  It looked alot more vibrant ( the top - Bandeau )  by picture !!
3.0,"I ordered black & white yet received red & black. Looks more Christmasie, which I'll still wear, but would have preferred the other."
3.0,"I bought the white dress and although it's very flattering and the fabric is nice, it's definitely see-through. Even wearing a nude bra/panties will show through.<br />Due to the style of the dress, it would be difficult to wear something under it. Unfortunately going to have to return it."
3.0,"It arrived right on time. Its looks exactly like its shown in the pic, nice bright colors. I got 3T size for my 2 year old son and it fit perfectly who has average height and weight. Material quality is average and not best."
3.0,"I really love the looks of this top because it's so different than others. But, it does run small; from reading other reviews I ordered one size up from my normal size. It was not loose at all (which I was hoping). I don't want to go 2 sizes up because the sleeves are already a little long and going up 2 sizes the sleeves would be very long. Bummer. I really wanted this to work."
3.0,"The shirt itself technically fit, but the shoulders were way off and tight. I don't generally have a problem with my shoulders."
3.0,I and a friend ordered one of these. Decent bands but the issue I have is the strap keeper ( the little loop that holds the strap from separating from the Velcro at the end) is too big. It's oversize and clumsy - not what you want in a working mans or operators watch.
3.0,"The socks are completely unfinished on the inside, and there are threads hanging every which way. They are a bit long for my calves, but I have shorter legs. The compression feels great, but the loose ends inside the stocking leave marks all over my legs."
3.0,"First off, it’s a great band, heavy duty, looks good and not stretchy like the silicone original. Here’s the bad... retaining bands are not as depicted in the picture, more square than rounded, no biggie I actually prefer them this way. The worst is the tools provided are absolutely unable to remove the original band and can hardly close the new one. If you don’t own a precision set of hex and torx screwdrivers then don’t bother buying this one."
3.0,"Good, but not finest that all."
3.0,This shirt/dress is not really flattering because the material is so thin. I wear the dress to bed because it is comfortable but I don't like clothing that is see through because I'm not into layering and having to find something to wear underneath. Overall the clothing is okay and it just depends upon what you're looking for.
3.0,These fit comfortably and are nice and stretchy but the synthetic fabric isn't breathable or absorbant in anyway. I can't wear them because they cause my skin to get irritated.
3.0,"Just couldn't make these work. Too tight, and I have thin thighs and calves. Fabric is thick and stretchy....but fit me like a sausage casing."
3.0,"These are cute shirts but when I ordered size large I got XL, which i returned because they were two big. Then I ordered size M and L and got size L and XL. XL wasn’t even a size option when I ordered so it’s bewildering. I kept the M (or L) and they are comfortable, but be aware they have no shelf bra support or extra lining which I would’ve appreciated.  Also the straps are not adjustable and kind of long. And they’re shorter than I’d like-cropped fit. Since I wanted these for weekend lounging for the lace to peek out of a Henley shirt, they will work well enough, but the search continues for the perfect layering cami."
3.0,They fall out easily the balls are hard to screw on and mage them stay on
3.0,"This is a really cute sock.  I like the fact that the saying appears high enough on the sock to be visible above my shoe. So many socks with silly sayings hide the words in your shoes.  However, the fabric is very cheap, and IMO this is in no way a $10 sock.  I would not keep it except that I am in need of a pair of silly socks for an immediate event.  Not sure that this will survive a washing completely intact.  For a ten-spot, I expect more."
3.0,The key chain is scratch up a bit/ alot although I just open it up once it got here along with the second one I got was the same
3.0,Jacket was too small for child
3.0,Cute but the fall down when exercising.
3.0,Watched looked great but it quit working in less than a month.  Total waste of time. POOR QUALITY
3.0,"The band is too large, while the cups are too small."
3.0,"I was looking for a smallish shoulder bag and was so enamoured by the teal color in the pictures that I hit buy now without reading the reviews warning about the misleading colors in the pictures. It's more like a denim color than anything like the images.<br /><br />The opening is also just little too small to fit my tablet, which isn't a deal breaker by itself, but combined with the color issue means I'm hitting the return button almost as quickly as I hit the buy button."
3.0,"Ok, these are not cool. These are dorky, and bulky, and feel uncomfortable on the nose.<br /><br />That said they cut glare and are irreplaceable when I'm driving."
3.0,It is very nice but.....not very well done or finished
3.0,Very comfortable bras as long as they lasted. The wire came out of my blue one within six weeks making it useless to me as a larger chested woman.
3.0,No cubre el frio
3.0,I love that the ears are bendable and the tail is attached by a pin. For reference I’m 5’6” 125 lbs. The neck tie is quite large even though it’s adjustable. The cuff links are also way too big (to the point i won’t be able to wear them) which sucks because it’s 2/5 of the product i purchased. At least the majority of the pieces work somewhat so i’m not too disappointed.
3.0,"The posts that go through them are pretty big, bigger than the whole in my ear."
3.0,"Earrings are ok, the stones are sparkly and the gold tone metal is a nice tone but they are much smaller than the photos and the colors of the stones is different and not as cute as the brighter colors in the product advertised photos. Will be returning because of this. I wanted big statement hearts with brighter colors."
3.0,"Just what I was looking for — right size stud, and appreciate that the post is longer than my previous purchases — except...after extended wear, my ears became irritated. The rose and yellow pairs were worn constantly (until one of each was lost) and I never had this problem. Don’t understand, if these are 14K throughout, why I have this issue. Makes me hesitate to buy again."
3.0,"Great peice , just the packaging. The necklace came broken."
3.0,It starting shedding day one.  That was a let down other than that it’s ok for the price
3.0,"Not what I expected, some advertising shows being able to shine light through it and see what it says on a wall etc. this cannot be achieved"
3.0,Well i've never had a problem with anything i've ever ordered before but when i got these one of the stones was out and loose in the package. A little disappointing but not that worried about it.
3.0,This top just does not look as good in real life as it does online. It’s very long and even the size small is really loose. I actually like the fabric and the lace doesn’t look cheap. It just isn’t for me.
3.0,It wrinkles easy but works well for a casual setting.
3.0,I bought the grey beanie. Looks like some colors also come with a skull cap but they grey one just came on its own. It's soft and pleasant to wear - especially if you've lost all your hair. It's quite large and may be too big for some - I personally like slouching it in the back so the size works for me. I do think it's overpriced - $18 is way too much for a basic cotton beanie.
3.0,"Watch out for improper labeling. Package that product came in was marked (L), but when I opened package and checked tag attached to underwear it was marked (XL) and they where too big. I will not order from this company again.. Duh! Made in China."
3.0,This frame is very flattering. Light weight and fancy. Though the little rhinestones on the side easily fall off. I will give a 5 if I knew where to find the spares.
3.0,Bought 3 times.  Definitely a get what you pay for situation.  The part that fits into the fitbit is not flexible so I keep breaking the connectors.  But they are cute and inexpensive enough to keep several on hand
3.0,Cute but very tiny. Well made but hard to close; it barely clears the thickness of my ear lobe.
3.0,"I like the feel of these socks.  However, I ordered basketball shocks and received baseball socks.  I contacted the seller who was very helpful.  But then, the pair they sent me was once again baseball.  My son loves basketball and chose these socks because they match his favorite team.  He was disappointed when they didn't come."
3.0,"Large and boxy, going to return"
3.0,It's a little large and I'm not sure there's a way to change the size
3.0,They are tighter around the neck than I expected. Stays up on nose nicely
3.0,Ordered in November have worn the black gloves and they were perfect. I wore the gray gloves for the first time today and noticed that there is a hole by the fingers. I haven’t worn the burgundy ones yet so not sure about them.
3.0,The part that fits around your waist is very small. I could get it past my legs. My niece tried it on who is a small girl and struggled to get it over her hips. Don't waste your time purchasing this if you're bigger person.
3.0,Looks way bigger in the picture than it actually is. Please read and head the description box.
3.0,This was a really cute shirt and the price was great.  However after one wash the stitching on the bottom hem came out.  It was a little sad and I wish the shirt would have been a little better quality.
3.0,I think it feels a little smallish to me. Also keep in mind that it’s a small brim hat. Looks more like the hat Sly Stalone wore in Rocky than a real Fedora like in the gangster movies.
3.0,Love it it's beautiful just a little big
3.0,I actually bough these for my tween daughters. They’re tiny so it’s very flattering on them but I can’t imagine this on an adult women unless you’re a size 0 or 2.
3.0,Box beaten up cute bracelet though.
3.0,"I bought a couple of these for a friend, who had a similar bottle opener and wanted some different colored ones. I was surprised at how thin and cheap they feel. I don't think they would last very long if used extensively."
3.0,"Not really tunic style; it fits just at the hip. Recommend going a size up unless you want the tight look. I usually wear xs to s got the s initially. It fit but I think it would look better looser, so I returned it.<br /><br />Also, I got the pink which ended up being very pretty but it doesn't have that pendant looking thing which I expected to be printed on the shirt. (It doesn't look like an accessory in the pictures). Not a deal breaker but definitely wish I'd be known.<br /><br />Overall, comfortable and nice color."
3.0,"Got these to go with a new suitcase to try to maximize packing efficiency.  These were AWFULLY small.....  I mean, I'm a bigger guy and I get that, but I had a difficult time fitting a single pair of jeans in to one of the cubes.  Kinda defeated the purpose.  I ended up packing pants loose and used these for smaller items like shirts, socks, underwear, and toiletries.  They seem well made and durable, but the fact that I couldn't fit a single 'outfit' into a cube kinda made them pointless."
3.0,The plastic circles on the sides of the mask keep falling off.
3.0,"Sealant was applied to cork handle of my fishing rod.  The rod brand is a Fenwick.<br /><br />Upon opening there is a thin plastic wafer that affixed itself to the bottle rim.  Initially I thought this was intentional to scrape off and reduce the load of sealant to brush since it was thick (i.e. Elmers glue).  The instructions indicated applying a thin coat.<br /><br />I then determined that this wafer was not intended to control brush load and realized it was part of the cap (seal).<br /><br />Applying a thin coat was difficult, the brush is just too stiff (nylon) and worked more like...spatula / trowel.  Application was rather uneven and thought it would self level.  I let it set for 30 minutes and it was still tacky and figured I had better give it 24 hours.  Next morning it was still tacky so I thought some radiant heat (sunlight) might help set / cure the sealant.  I had it out for 8+ hours and made sure to turn the handle.  The tackiness was slightly reduced and the finish was a bit rough.  Figure I would use my leather gloves (pourous surface) and give it a rub down and it might improve the reduce tacky feel and improve finish.<br /><br />I will be returning to Amazon.<br /><br />I would recommend that the manufacturer consider:<br /><br />1) titrate the sealant or recommend dilution ratio and use multiple application<br />2) recommend using a bristled brush or simply change the brush / cap stiffness<br /><br />Note: I would presume that the tackiness would naturally hold fine debris (dirt magnet) and the rough surface (increased surface area) would do add accumulation of same.<br /><br />Regardless, I presume the aforementioned is acceptable to most who use as a cork sealant(?)  i.e. sandals.  However, I hope that my recommendations can be reviewed and perhaps a change in consistency of sealant and brush change could be considered.<br /><br />In the meantime I will be looking for an alternative sealant.<br /><br />Thank You!"
3.0,The ties should have been cut a half inch narrower at the widest point in order to stay in line with today's trend.
3.0,First time I used it for my wallet phone and drink I got a hole.
3.0,They were not as comfortable or supported arch as expected. They are cute!
3.0,"This bra is beautiful and well made but only comes in a B cup.  When I looked at the size chart I misunderstood it to read BC cup, but I believe it meant just B Cup.  I've looked for a bra like this for a long time, something comfortable and would be good support. So I will only give it 3 stars because as I said it is well made."
3.0,A little smaller than what I expected. But all in all a quality pair of sunglasses.
3.0,"This rain jacket is really cute..I wear a 12 and 14, med and large. I ordered this in a XL. It just fits buttoned up."
3.0,One earring is noticeably brighter than the other. You get what you pay for. Will wear until someone comments.
3.0,It's extremely thin for a hoodie.
3.0,"This is really cute but &#34;high maintenance.&#34; It has to be ironed and it takes a lot of ironing to get the wrinkles out of the skirt. You need a slip because the skirt is very see-through. And although it appears in the picture to have a waist, on me the &#34;waist&#34; is higher than mine and I'm a petite size. Still, for $9 I paid for it, it's worth it."
3.0,"Very cute once I fixed it, but the heart charm came on backwards. I had to remove it and flip it around so that the black side (instead of the silver backing) showed by default. A bit annoying to work with, but overall what I expected from a product in this price range."
3.0,Did not look as I expected and it was tight fitting not like picture.  I returned it because not what I was looking for but. It was nice.
3.0,I expected clear frames but they are still awesome.
3.0,Got damaged after using it 2 months.
3.0,La cintura esa pequeña no estira
3.0,your look like a supposed to is real cute nice little gift to give your girlfriend your wife or your friend my wife loves it!!!
3.0,I generally wear a size 12 dress. The XL does not zipper up.
3.0,"Much smaller then expected. Its probably less then 1"" width"
3.0,Very cute. Color is same as what it shows. I have chosen not to wear as a dress due to the clinginess and transparency of the material. But it goes great with leggings.
3.0,"It is pretty but it is too large, it looks as xl instead of l."
3.0,"They're great glasses, just the lenses are regular adult size, not children."
3.0,"I ordered several of these hats in different colors and the only one that had the issue was the black one, it came completely off center, I paint these hats and not even that could save it! Amazon was great and replaced my item and the 2nd one came just fine. Just a heads up that quality control may be an issue."
3.0,cheap price but stones were very dull and easily fell off
3.0,"It's a nice looking pen. However, it was smaller than I anticipated, and it fell off of my bag within a couple days. Very sad about losing it and wish it could be held more securely for the price."
3.0,I wish it looked more Garnet... to me it looks more like ruby. If the color would have matched the picture more then it definitely would have gotten 5 stars.
3.0,"My daughter chose these necklaces as Christmas gifts for her and her cousins. After wearing it the first day the donut fell off. She was so gentle with it, I don't understand why the link connecting the donut to the rest of the necklace fell off. Needless to say my daughter is devastated."
3.0,"It was not as long as I needed it to be. Very cute top, just not long enough."
3.0,"Followed size guide and still got an item 2 sizes larger than I needed. Now have to get something else for event on March 10, 2019. Bomber!"
3.0,Fit was small. Short torso. Fabric was kinda shiny and cheap feeling. Returned.
3.0,don't know
3.0,Don't like the material. But the dress is beautiful and fits perfectly
3.0,Arrived a bit damaged but couldn’t returned it as my son came out of boot camp just before I received it. He loved it and it what does matter but quality not as good as I expected
3.0,They are ok out of the box. I have not tried them yet although the stupid review thing keeps popping up so I gues this is the review you get until I use them. Didn’t see any batteries with the gloves so rechargeable? Not sure.
3.0,The Silky Durags are nice and shines and seem to be better for helping my hair retain moisture. The only reason I gave three stars was because of wave caps. They are like a one size fit and did not have a option on head size. They are way to big for my head and will not be able to use half the product I bought.
3.0,"Very cute, loose fitting, but material is polyester/cotton blend and not very soft."
3.0,it’s nice i guess. drawstrings and pockets weren’t on the same side so i look stupid wearing them.
3.0,The color of this shirt is VERY bright orange.  Not the subdued/burnt orange shown in the picture.  Not what I expected.  Not a shirt I would wear except on Halloween day itself.  More novelty than stylish.  It is 100% polyester.  Tag stated 5% lycra but it wasn't slightly stretchy.  Well made.  Required significant ironing even after wash and dry in dryer.  Returning.
3.0,It fit big on top...looked more like a cowneck top. At waist had thick material and fit tighter than i thought it would. I wear latge.
3.0,I would have loved to have this dress in a  bigger  size
3.0,"the stone appears to be mostly black, you need very bright light to bring out the blue, the quality is good, but it looks like I am wearing black, not sapphire."
3.0,It is smaller then it looks on the photo
3.0,My piercing is kind of deep in my ear. It will not close all the way. The moon is touching my ear. I still like it and will wear it because you can't tell it isn't closed all the way unless you look closely. But will probably eventually need to replace it with a piece that will close.
3.0,"I like this however, it is plated in gold so there is no stamping to actually prove that it is truly real gold. There is nothing in the packaging that indicated that it was even plated in gold.  It is nice enough, not real heavy. I emailed the company and they actually emailed me back so I guess that is a plus. I guess if I were buying something that was gold plated, I would want some proof. If I were to give this as a gift they would just think it was costume jewelry."
3.0,"extremely small!!!!!! But, i bought it to wear like one model showed as a jacket, would not close in the front.  I get a lot of compliments!!!  wish it were bigger so I could wear it by itself and a dress too."
3.0,"lovely quality, knit..however very dense and uncomfortably hot"
3.0,A little more like winter gloves than I thought. Very warm but bulky.
3.0,"Yellow didn't work, but made it worse."
3.0,Laces are fine but clips are worthless.  Do yourself a favor and just knot the ends.
3.0,returned.the floral print was very odd. there were only a few roses with one being directly over only one boob. looked weird.
3.0,"Loved the concept. Thought it would be the solution to my gym backpack issue.  However, the snaps kept unsnapping, causing the items to bunch up. Would have been much better to have the shelves zip in place and have the snaps for reinforcement.<br />Would up tossing the bag. To me a good idea, but not well thought out."
3.0,The design is cute but waa a bit too big for my girl.
3.0,The product is a bit big for small size. The quality of the product also be improved on.
3.0,THe fit was off these were larger than expected
3.0,"Not the best design, seam in the middle rubbed my nose and chin. Bought for work and had to take off an hour into my shift. The design is also smaller than it looks in the picture."
3.0,Not bas
3.0,"The elastic waist band immediately went crazy and got all twisted- it’s like it isn’t sewn into the waist correctly. The buttons are just decorative- maybe I missed that in the description, but I was disappointed. It’s also extremely long. You can pull it up and wear it as a dress- but that contributes to the waistband issues. The material is light and cool and feels nice. I do like it, just a little let down."
3.0,SUPER CUTE. Doesn't hold that much stuff though.
3.0,The shirt fit as a medium would. I did not like that it was a stretchy material.
3.0,"If you feel you must wear something to protect yourself from germs, but still want to show the world that you're a patriot, then this American flag gaiter would be a good choice. However,  it won't keep germs in or out, but at least you shouldn't get attacked for not wearing a mask by frenzied wally-worlders.  It's light weight, well decorated with the flag and is super easy to wash in the regular laundry cycle.<br /><br />Update 8.16.20 - I wore this mask all day yesterday while touring a college campus and it worked fine for a while but after a while it seemed to stretch and kept falling down off my face.  I will have to adjust it with some darts to  keep it from sliding down."
3.0,not too bad for price but didnt fit.
3.0,"Good product, cheap material.<br />Sleeves ripped but will have it fixed"
3.0,"I bought this top because i liked the athletic cut of the back in the picture. I was disappointed when it arrived b/c it looks more like an 80's tank top with the full back. It's a gift, so I'm still gifting it because of &#34;what&#34; it says, but I am not pleased with &#34;how&#34; it looks."
3.0,"The bag looks like it is suede in the picture, but it isn't even leather.  The inside of the bag smells fishy."
3.0,"This dress is pretty in person. The color is true to what you see here online - the yellow is somewhat see-through, so plan for light/neutral colored undergarments. The fabric is incredibly soft, jersey-cotton. I can imagine this being very breathable in a hot summer day.<br /><br />The stomach area was where i found issue, it clings to my belly. I'm not super skinny, but I'm typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses, so I'm not too large either. Everywhere else fit well - I just imagine that I'll have to wear shapewear under the dress to keep my rolls concealed.<br />Overall, the dress is okay. I like enough to keep it."
3.0,They are pretty but not well made. My pair only lasted for a week.
3.0,The product was somewhat small and the quality was not what I expected. The seam has already begun to separate.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but didn't fit as expected. It's too big and no smaller size. I'll definitely have to return."
3.0,Shirts run small. I normally wear L so I got XL they’re still a bit snug. Material is not a stretchy or a “Drifit” type like a Nike or Underarmour. Got them as under shirts for work however the material is slick so outer shirt untucks easily due this fact.
3.0,It’s ok. I’ve worn it twice but wasn’t excited about it. I’ll honestly probably donate it 🤷🏼‍♀️
3.0,Quality material and workmanship but the 3x jacket fit like an xl. Disappointed because it is a nice  Tracksuit.
3.0,Dress fit was smaller so it was returned.
3.0,Orange is Brighter than pictured
3.0,Comfortable fit. Soft material
3.0,I only received one set.
3.0,Comfortable but a little thin.
3.0,"You get about what you pay for. The coloring is really weird, but since I got it to stay warm and it's not going to be seen on the top layer, or outside my house I guess it's acceptable enough. Definitely warm, I'll give you that."
3.0,"Dress design is very cute but the material though slightly thick is see through (white). The color is also more off white, and ran very small in the bust. Also came with an orange stain on the collar."
3.0,"I had originally purchased an XL based on the reviews that said you need to size up. Not the case! I had already worn and washed it, so I had to purchase another but size L. Fit better but not perfect. The pads in the top are annoying AF and are clearly for women with smaller chests as they make my chest look boxy and the pads are not proportional to the size of the suit. I ended up taking the pads out but then felt like I was going to fall out of the suit. Overall, a decent suit but definitely not one of my faves."
3.0,The locket is very pretty but smaller than what the pictures lead you to believe. I was expecting something bigger.
3.0,"Too big even though I matched up my measurements with their size chart. Cute pattern, good quality, just wrong size. The medium fit more like a large or xl."
3.0,"I love the style but had to change my review from 5 stars to 3 because after 2 months of wearing these, the tinted lining on the lens is beginning to bublble up around the edges and peel off. Very bummed because I really liked these!"
3.0,I sent this back. I thought the material would be a soft Sherpa. Instead it was silky like and less fluffy/soft than i expected.
3.0,Good quality. Super small for an xl
3.0,It looked nice. It took a while to be delivered. I bought it for my 11 year old daughter to carry around her personal items in school. From the pictures I didn't realize how large the purse was. It was too big for someone her age so I let my coworker have it. She absolutely loves it. It is my own fault for just going by the pictures and not checking the sizing in the description.
3.0,The material is very soft and like a polyester seal very nice
3.0,"Slides up and works, but when its soaked, you have to roll it off you. Definitely wash it first and its bigger than expected. Order 1 size down."
3.0,"hope my daughter can wear it, pretty small in the shoulder armpit area for the size ordered. but decent quality"
3.0,Good glasses but a little to big
3.0,Great quality and very beautiful. Love it!
3.0,"This earring wrap is nice, but on the small side.  The clip does not hold it in place unless it is very tight which makes it uncomfortable."
3.0,"This a very light scarf.  If it is tied, it is very nice looking. The quality of construction, stitching, and materials are poor.  I am attaching pictures."
3.0,"Now the dress is gorgeous!!!!!!, but if the sizing is so off that it's more then a full two sizes off like if ur a size large 2x or 3x but the biggest size is only a teeny bit loose in the breast area on my size 5 women's 120lb 13 yr old daughter. All in all its a gorgeous dress just order 4 sizes smaller .I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me.

3.0,It's a little shorter length than expected but super cute! Also looks like a cheaper material that what you'd pay $7 at target. Was it worth the money? No. Keeping it though.
3.0,Love the graphics but after just 2 washes it faded quite significantly.
3.0,"Overall, it's okay. Be sure to order your size because it doesn't stretch. I would prefer the leg velcro was longer so it will stay better with strenuous exercise."
3.0,The texture isn’t as expected. It has an “itchy” feel to it.
3.0,Much too thin and tear easily. Size was smaller than what a 3X should be. Will not buy again.
3.0,It lasted a year then I had to throw them away.
3.0,The cut of these shorts is a little on the strange side.  The legs are much larger than pictured and “float” around my thighs
3.0,I ordered the olive green dress and received a lot of compliments. My only issue with this dress is the material is kind of cheap so I’ve been washing it in the delicate cycle. It’s a decent dress to have in the closet.
3.0,The earring doesn't fit my ear-much too short or small.
3.0,Beautiful the first time I wore it but afterwards noticed an almost streaked dye look to the skirt. Not super noticeable to me but hopefully not to others
3.0,The valve is on the fire emblem. It's ok.
3.0,I had high hopes for these gym shorts.  I'm typically a medium in any type of shorts from various brands.  I checked the fitment guide and seemed like I aligned with the medium size recommendation.  My findings are once I got them and tried them on they are very big and a bit baggy.  The inner legging part was even baggy feeling as well.  My recommendation is size your self up to the chart and then order a size lower.
3.0,"This wallet is gorgeous, and my husband wanted it for Father's Day.  Turns out it doesn't fit in a pocket.  Like, regular pants pockets.  I'm not sure what they were thinking.  It's about 30% too large."
3.0,They strink to a smaller size
3.0,This is a beautiful dress and jacket.  I usually order a 10 or 12 and decided to go with the 12.  I couldn't ever get it over my bust or hips.
3.0,"These are definitely NOT compression. They're a looser fit. Not what I was looking for but I like the material & they'll still work so I'm keeping them. Was just expecting a tighter, fit. I thought that's what &#34;compression&#34; meant."
3.0,The Logo is old and scratched. Cant return it because shipping is too expensive from Nairobi.
3.0,It’s super soft but way way way to big!
3.0,"Ok quality, cannot not fit prescription glasses inside (and I have a very minimalist frame)."
3.0,"Extremely tiny. Like, you'll sniff it up in your nose and it'll be stuck forever."
3.0,Too tight in the bust
3.0,Very thin material but it was priced cheap so I didn't expect much. I am glad I got in black otherwise you would be able to see everything.  Other than that I like it.  I hope it makes it through the wash and dry.  Better wash on delicate cycle Wearing to yoga but would not feel comfortable wearing out in public.
3.0,"No es bueno el cierre de la malla del reloj,se desprende con facilidad lo que no me da garantias de que no se me caiga.No entiendo muy bien cual es el funcionamiento de las esferas.El pequeño manual no es para nada explicativo. El modelo es bonito , es sensilli de achicar con la herramienta que provee."
3.0,"The quality is okay. To be expected for a 3-pack I suppose. I only bought these because I started &#34;Bro-tank Fridays&#34; at my CrossFit gym as a joke. Subjectively speaking they're kinda douchey and not what I'd wear to the gym otherwise. For my 7am class, they're a welcome source of laughter on Fridays."
3.0,I bought this as an alternate to my old Adidas sandals which are now selling for $70. Those were very comfortable but I can't justify that much money for sandals. These look good in the picture but they are not comfortable to me. It is a hard plastic with little give to it. Since I mostly wear them around the house I decided to keep them. Again - you get what you pay for.
3.0,Fit but not very durable! Made cheaply
3.0,"I like the lightweight wicking fabric.<br />I’m normally a medium, ordered a small because I read the reviews. Fits great!<br />Down side: they aren’t long so they ride up."
3.0,"They're ok.  They are kind of pretty, but you can tell they are costume jewelry."
3.0,"imagine when you put this crop top on and raise your hands, the top will fly up."
3.0,The straps are big around the ankle so it's not very supportive. Wish it were a little smaller. I wish I would of ordered them a smaller size. Maybe they would of fit better. Otherwise it is a very pretty shoe with a lot of detail.
3.0,"This is cute, looks good, magnets are very strong, and its great quality.<br />Bad side, magnets are little too strong. It hurts to wear it for more than five minutes as a previous person has said."
3.0,This wristlet is nice.  The color doesn't seem to be light purple to me.  It looks light blue.  I attempted to slip all my cards into the card slots.  I find that some of the slots aren't quite the same size as others and the cards won't fit.  I think this is a problem with the stitching.  So I have two slots that I can't use.  Otherwise its nice.  It comes with both a cross body strap and a wristlet strap.
3.0,The dress looks excellent on and fits perfectly.  The dress does flair out as seen in the picture because there is a layer of crediline in it.  The lace detailing on the top of the dress is a perfect match to the picture provided.  My only complaint is that there is a seam inside the dress with the itchy irratating crediline pops through and rubs against me.  Also the lace while lovely isn't completely finished so it begains to ray very easily.
3.0,This is just ok. It is very thing and smooth- it feels fake. it does look nice though. Make sure you hang it because it does get kinks very easily.
3.0,"The fabric is light (in a good way) and the shoulders, chest, and arms fit well. It’s snug in my waist and I wish it had more of a flare to accommodate hips. I’m NOT curvy and it’s still cut too straight for my preference. They’re perfect for the price and working out at home-but not as flattering as I hoped.  I’m happy to have these three but I wouldn’t re-buy."
3.0,"I wish you could order the bra and panties separately. I'm a tall woman with a small chest and loads of hip and tush. Buying a set never works for me as one piece or the other does not fit. In this case, the bra fit beautifully and the bottoms... Not so much. But the bra is gorgeous and a nice touch to an off-the-shoulder top."
3.0,"Products were okay, didn't know my ear was already stretched to 1/2 but the material irritated my ears after washing it twice but the colour is beautiful!"
3.0,Very comfortable but rip if you are too active
3.0,Big cheap sunglasses that you don't have to worry about breaking or losing.<br /><br />I received a free sample to test and provide an honest reivew.
3.0,"This watch is very visually appealing and overall I love how it looks. HOWEVER, it is a very heavy watch. The clock part is very thick compared to a normal watch that you would buy at the store. I cannot even wear it consistently because of how big and clunky it is. Also I was hoping to find a watch that his a digital view of the time as the picture shown for this watch has. The digital time is not permanently on the watch it is something you can press a button to check. Overall its an okay watch if you don't mind the weight and having a non-digital watch."
3.0,It is definitely not a unisex small - maybe a women's small.  But way too small for men's sizing.  Good quality fabric.
3.0,This is more  casual than I expected. I was hoping to wear this to work. It is definitely not suitable for an office.
3.0,"This is an cheap hat - yes, I said ""cheap"" as in not sturdy, poorly packaged by Amazon, and overall tacky look.  It was crushed so badly that even trying to push it back out, there was till a crease in the 'brim"".  Waiting on refund."
3.0,Very difficult to properly size. Bought my 4 year old grandson this shirt. Child's size small is gigantic!
3.0,Cute but not built to last more than an hour or two
3.0,They way they looked cheap
3.0,Fine watch! Wore out too quick!
3.0,"Broken, loved the look of it, but the clasp broke, just popped off!"
3.0,"This is a Beautiful cover up, but I have to return it. I thought it was something different. Because of the beautiful fabric, it will not stay closed like I need it to."
3.0,the packaging didn't not look very new but the watch was actually new
3.0,The color is much brighter in person. It's more of a orange/pink instead of a light pink.
3.0,Cute.<br />Great for a season
3.0,"My fault, I suppose, but it is so much smaller than it appears.  Measurements are given and I should have paid more attention, but on the model, it looks perfect.  I can't believe the model is wearing a pendant that is 1.5 inches diameter.  It's just okay."
3.0,The bottoms fit well the top did not have amything to keep it in place so it keept rising up.
3.0,its okay but the way it fits is odd and it looks weird on my ear but at least it fits. its hard to get it to stay on though and takes constant readjusting.
3.0,"I ordered small, the tags all say M, and they are still quite tight.  Fine for wearing under another shirt but too tight to wear alone."
3.0,loved the design but it was way too small and thin not really what I was expencting
3.0,They are okay. A little pricey but ehhh. The nose thing wasn't my favorite so I took it off and now they are better.
3.0,"Material feels very cheap and not worth the $16 price, more like a $5 piece of clothing"
3.0,"My gnome came without nose. I can glue something on its place, but still a little disappointed. He is also not weighed and tips over very easy."
3.0,"I am not a huge fan of the high waist bikini, but this looked so cute on the model! On me, the top is great, I love it but will have to pair it with different bottoms because these fit weird. Kind of tight and baggy in different areas,  not flattering at all on me."
3.0,I order one size larger to be on the safe side that it would fit but it is still to small.  I gave it to my daughter unstead of the time consuming return.
3.0,"I'm a 40D, and I vary between a L and an XL, depending on the brand. I ordered this in an XL and it smashes my boobs. It's too bad because they don't make it in a larger size, and this is a really lovely piece for the price. Definitely go by the bust measurements on the chart. I'm so sad it doesn't fit, because I would've definitely ordered more colors. :-/ P.S. It is not that stretchy- maybe 10-15% give."
3.0,Cute design but rough poor tee shirt quality
3.0,This. Item is not Sterling silver.
3.0,If it says expected but it shrinks really easily do not put in dryer
3.0,Bought it for my daughter for Christmas and I know she will love it but as I was wrapping it I can already tell it won't last. For the price I cannot complain too much so I still give it 3 stars. You get what you pay for.
3.0,I guess  expected to fit to my head abit big and the shape on the top of the hat doesn't stay in shape I have to play with it to shape it up every time I place it on my head<br />I do like that it has sun protection that's a plus
3.0,"I loved it and it fit as expected, does the job. Three stars only because it's not steel boned. Was supposed to be here between 1-17 and 2-7 , arrived on 1-5."
3.0,"these jeans are really made good, I need to order a smaller size soon. Will order again soon, thank you!"
3.0,They are starting to show the copper metal under the silver paint. I haven't had them for very long and they are already losing the silver .
3.0,"Great grip for yoga or walking around the house on slippery floors. If you have a larger foot over a size eight, these socks are going to be tight and small on your feet. There was some shrinkage after being laundered the first time which added to the problem. Pity, because these were nice help for stability when stretching on an exercise mat."
3.0,"I ordered the deep purple.  What I got was a normal classic purple.  It's pretty bright, not really my favorite color.  I decided to keep since purple is the color of my home team, so I can still use it, but it is not what I was expecting.  If It had been the right color I probably would have given 4 or 5 stars."
3.0,"Cute suit for the price but fits a little snug, I an 5'4'' 120lb (usually a size 4 or S) and ordered a M, found it to be a little tight on my butt."
3.0,These run very small!!
3.0,"Advertisement shows bold, standard colors. When my order arrived there was one white. One black and one solid red. The rest were neon green an neon pink. There were no neon colors shown in the advertising that would make me think that what I would get. Pretty misleading and disappointed."
3.0,"Beautiful colors, great variety, well made - they were about two sizes too big and the straps LOOK like they adjust but they do not. Still a great bargain, but read the sizing carefully - more like adult sizing than kids."
3.0,"Kinda small, no elastic to allow more comfortable fit/adjustment to head size differences. Disappointed that it was 2-hats and both exactly alike.  Advertisement for item implied that there would be 2-different designs.  I would not purchase this item from this seller again"
3.0,The description on the site says this is bright coral and that's what the picture looks like too. When it arrived it was NEON pink. Not what I was looking for. I actually didn't even try it on because that's not the color that I needed.
3.0,"They look fine, but don’t know how well they will perform in warmth or durability yet."
3.0,Color seems more purple than blue
3.0,Doesn't pass the flame test but really cute. Would be perfect you could insert a filter. Probably not protecting much. Looks great with dressy outfits.
3.0,"T-shirt was OK. Content on T-shirt was as expected / advertised. The problem was I either didn't see or it wasn't listed as coming from China. Had to extend my estimated wait time twice. Would not have ordered, if I had seen where it was coming from, as I have had many similar problems in the past."
3.0,Very pretty but unless you need a size 8 or larger do not get.
3.0,Nice shoe but not really holding up well to my active 7 year old. These will last maybe another 2 weeks.
3.0,Shipped promptly.  Fit as expected.  Provided good support.  I gave it 3 stars because it looks matronly and the horizontal lines on the cups are aging.  Did not like how it looked.
3.0,My wrist has turned blue after wearing for a little over one week. I like the looks of the watch and it keeps accurate time. I just do not know  what to do about this problem.<br />Joanne WD
3.0,Don’t like that it isn’t the usual hoodie material<br />It’s polyester like and very thin
3.0,"I chose them  for the blue color. If I have known they were gray I would have not bought them. You get what you paid, not a bargain at all"
3.0,"This is a great, inexpensive shirt.  The fit is flattering and it's so soft.  However, the plaid fabric is printed, so the back side of the cowl neck is basically white.  Very difficult to arrange the cowl so that the white isn't showing somewhere,  especially since the edges are rolled.  I love the plaid,  but would suggest you go with onee of the solid colors."
3.0,The top is larger with barely any support for the breasts.
3.0,"Its okay,  its made poorly.  But it looks good"
3.0,"The support that these socks offer is great. Color is vibrant. One thing I don't like about these socks is that they are really long. I am 5'6&#34; and fully stretched out these socks come over my knees. So I have to scrunch them down or fold them over at the top (which is uncomfortable). Probabaly wouldn't buy another pair based on the length. Other than that, I would say they are a good purchase (for a taller person)."
3.0,It wore out quickly
3.0,"The size I ordered fits over my foot but not over my calf. I ordered the XL, but it doesn't fit over my calf of my leg."
3.0,"I haven't bought this watch, but I just wanted to mention the fact that the roman numeral for 4 isn't &#34;IIII&#34; as this watch appears to declare from the photos, it's &#34;IV&#34;. Personally, I have a hard time purchasing products that can't get very basic aspects of their design correct. I was thinking of buying this watch until I noticed that. Will not be buying this item."
3.0,As someone with a big nose and face I would say this isn’t the biggest ring I’ve ever put on. It does happen to run into my other piercing so it clashes a bit. Only get this if you like big showy statement pieces and don’t have a Medusa piercing 😝
3.0,Tried to put the one on a hen and it didn't want to snap. Realized a piece was missing off the snap. So it is useless.  I haven't tried the other one in the package yet.
3.0,i dont get many compliments on it.
3.0,"The size they sent (which I didn't get to choose) was 25 cm, and that's a little too big for my size 7/7.5 feet. And the purple is really a pinkish purple :("
3.0,Not as fond of it as expected. Sleeves not fitted....split hem by design. would not order again. disappointed.
3.0,"I like this hat.  I was upset when it arrived because it was folded and looked ugly with the bend across the front of the brim, but I held it over the steaming kettle for a minute and the bend came out.  I wish they packed it better in the first place, but this solution works :)"
3.0,the hat arrived bows and flowers were crushed but otherwise pretty
3.0,Looks aight but the material is wwwaaaayyyy delicate.
3.0,"I got the color pink, but it came here gold? I thought it would be supper cute and I would wear it everywear, but it's not what it seemed, I'd recommend if you got a different color, and if you wanted to wear it, and you thought long and hard about if you'd wear it or not."
3.0,"Too large, seller said it's plus size that's why it's bigger than normal. Didn't see it anywhere on description/title"
3.0,too wrinkle and small size is good for US XS wear's
3.0,"This was WAY huge, definitely recommend downsizing."
3.0,They are very nice and vibrant but there are only 4 when the title says 5.
3.0,Screen print is kinda cheap looking
3.0,Runs small. Order up a sz
3.0,I bought this scarf for my daughter.  She said the scarf is thin and does not bunch up high around your neck.
3.0,They stay on. They kind of hurt if they are in for too long though. They need some sort of comfort thing on the end so they are more comfortable. They were also too small to use for my septum (which was why I bought it).
3.0,Advertised as DD cup but nade very small. Not worth the amount of money I paid.  Sent it back.
3.0,Color was good and might be cute on some but not made to flatter plus size. Just looks like you are wearing a sack and made me look bigger.
3.0,"I liked how well this dress fit. However, the material is much thinner than I expected."
3.0,"Color may vary - I got a red&black version of the item, though I think other color variations may also show up despite ordering the same item. Blowing the three compartments to get this to fill correctly also is a delicate matter - one of the sides popped as I thought I put enough air pressure in, but buttoning the seal closed resulted in me popping the side accidentally. When fully inflated, the helmet is comfortable enough to wear for short periods (it can get warm under the plastic) but doesn't stay on if you move around a lot - a looped strap around the ear holes can be a good idea for keeping the helmet from falling off."
3.0,This is a cute set but for a logo of where your boobs should be this was slightly below my neck. Ridiculous looking
3.0,I ordered this for my MIL who likes looser more modest tops. In the picture it looks more high quality than it did in person. The stitching is a little sloppy and the creases weren't straight. It is okay for the price but not the nicest top.
3.0,"I like the colors and shape, dislike the feel of the fabric! Feels like polyester. I prefer my sweatshirts to be made of cotton"
3.0,too tight and short.
3.0,"I bought this to wear over a dress for a wedding. It ended up being really cold that day and I wore a jacket instead. That being said it is a really cute little top layer piece. The arm holes are a little big on me (5'5, 115lbs). It's nice for dressing up a tank top or simple dress in the summer."
3.0,"Boots look nice, they feel comfortable, wore them for three hours, I tried taking them off by holding the back of the right boot with my left boot and the sole came apart, not very well glued, I'll glue them back up and use them, other than that they seem decent for the price"
3.0,"Panty lines show with this dress, and also the fit didn't work for my body type overall. Perhaps for taller women? It just didn't look like a very high quality dress."
3.0,This is a very pretty strap for glasses!  I love all the beads and it is long enough.  After a while though the elastic that you slip over your glasses loosens and the glasses will fall off. That was why I gave 3 stars!
3.0,"I have to keep adjusting it because it's magnetic and slips down the band and loosens when I workout with it. Plus, it snags my clothes because on the ends, the metal comes undone and creates a ""hook"" that's super inconvenient."
3.0,Really thin. Cheap material . It’s ok
3.0,"Like the look of it, but a bit too big. Not Slim Fit at all."
3.0,"Based on reviews, I bought a large (5' 5&#34;, 140 lbs, evenly distributed weight) and it was too big. I would say this is pretty regular in terms of size. I would have been fine with a medium. I ended up returning because it was a bit shapeless and I have somewhat of an hourglass shape."
3.0,El vestido es bellísimo y queda muy bien tanto de ancho como de largo... PEROOO es muy transparente
3.0,I picked this up super cheap one day and figured it would be fun for at least a few minutes. My son loved it. My daughter did not.
3.0,fits very well but center piece color is lighter than side pieced (i purchased the all red)
3.0,"It is okay.  I don't like that it has to sit over the ears on the top of the hairline/forehead to stay in place; if I push it behind the ears, it falls off.  But it works well enough."
3.0,"The idea of the dress is great, I loved the pattern and the fabric was very soft. However, the armpit cut down really low so it showed the side of your bra and the length of the dress hit above the ankle. I expected floor length and I would've figured out a work-around regarding the bra showing but it gaped open at the chest and hit at an awkward length on your leg. I'm not even that tall, I'm 5'6"". Sadly returned it."
3.0,Great design and fit. Can even wear it across my chest. Wish the leather was of higher quality.
3.0,The torso of this suit is super long. I ordered a size smaller and it was still too long.
3.0,They basically look like pajamas to me but they would work if you want medevil look
3.0,Item looks good and is warm but bunches at the waist. Would be a good fit for someone without a flat stomach.
3.0,It's a beautiful dress but it was too tight from the side up to the bust.
3.0,"I purchased these shorts for my gymnast daughter. While the spandex shorts fit fine, the waistband was way too large so I am returning."
3.0,"Love this necklace!  The only reason for the 3 star rating is the fact that the large red piece in the center was broken lose when I opened the package.  A small amount of super glue and the problem was fixed.  With better packaging this wouldn't be a problem. It does come wrapped in bubble wrap with foam around it but this isn't enough during such long shipping.  A well fitting box along with the padding would be helpful.<br />  Other than the piece being broken off,  I truly love the necklace.  I have had several compliments on it.  Several people didn't realize amazon carried jewelry like this.  There should be several more sold from the ladies that complimented me on it."
3.0,"The black ones are a disappointment, they pill too much. The pink ones are ok."
3.0,It's cute and looks exactly like the picture. It's slightly small for me but it looks good and cute! Very nice
3.0,"The shirt and the vest fit fine but the pants were way too small. Very cute set though, disappointed to have to return it"
3.0,"Returned it...fabric was much too sheer for work, which is what I intended it for.  Would be pretty enough for a dressier setting."
3.0,"Good quality, bad sizing"
3.0,Bought an XL for my son who wears a 34 waist.<br />When I opened these I actually thought they either sent me a child XL or a men's small.<br />They didn't even fit my other son who has a 30 in waist.I<br />They seemed to be decently made.<br />Was easy to return though.
3.0,"I have a D cup and it has not been friendly. The zipper doesn't like to stay up, I wish it had a clasp at the top to better secure. It is fine for light work just as it states, Yoga. I wouldn't buy another one. The main use I had for it was breastfeeding and a bra not constricting."
3.0,Rolls and can be uncomfortable. Material is nice though
3.0,"It's hard to buy underwear or socks on line.  I can use these socks, but they are a little tight."
3.0,"so this fits as expected for me. but i didnt realize in the yellow stripes on the sides it has some weird wording ""y to blvck vibes"".  what the heck does that mean?<br /><br />i wouldnt recommend buying"
3.0,"Decent dress for the price. However, fabric did not stretch hardly at all and was too small for me. Cute design though."
3.0,"Not nearly as feathered as pictured.  I expected to maybe do a little bit of fluffing and filling, but basically I will be remaking the entire thing.  Glad I have some time before I need to use it!"
3.0,This onesie looks like the picture however when it arrives to me it had 3 holes in it. I know basic hand stitching techniques and should be able to fix the holes as they are in the seams throughout the garnet but it’s still disappointing to receive a product that clearly hasn’t been through quality assessment at all.
3.0,The top is extremely to small need more material added
3.0,"Another Asian product, a little small.  You will need an extender."
3.0,"Left my fingers a weird color, but the rings we just as pictured"
3.0,"Goodness the design is fantastic and there just isn't enough Jack in the world from Nightmare Before Christmas. However I took off a few stars because the quality just isn't great when it comes to this dress. It is very thin, though at least soft. I doubt it will last long. I would check wash directions to help this last long but the fact is, it has no tag what so ever, not even imprinted size. This item came with no bag, no tags, nothing. It could be a size 4x and we would have no idea. I have no idea the size that actually came, I can say it is tight on a very thin tall 18 year old girl and it was supposed to be medium. Thankfully she likes it, though is bursting out of it. That of course will not stop her!"
3.0,"Pretty dress, but ended up returning. I loved the flowered material, but the top lace material was heavy and weighed down the dress. I wish they made a dress entirely of the flowered material."
3.0,"Skirt doesn’t flare as much as the in the photo. The top doesn’t actually button or unbutton. A little disappointed, but still okay."
3.0,"It would be great to have a matching belt to cinch in, just below the breasts, just like the peasants of Eastern Europe still dress (for special occasions). I do have belts, but they do not work. A matching (or coordinating) fabric belt would be perfect. The advantage to you is with the  added accessories, I'd be willing to pay considerably more for this dress.<br /><br />Otherwise it's just to much like a potato sack, albeit a pretty &amp; stylish potato sack."
3.0,the stone in the tear drop was loose in the package and I fixed it myself with super glue alittle disappointed
3.0,You get what you pay for... Paid $10 and you can tell... its very cheaply made. Its very cute but it would not be a good every day purse because it may come a part easily with lots of use. If you want to just use it occasionally it would be perfect. The metal clasps for the shoulder strap is very thin and easily bent.
3.0,Was really hoping this would make me more aware of standing straighter.  But it just felt like I was strapped into a lot of hooks and fabric— a girdle for my chest.  I still have it in my drawer but I avoid wearing it because it’s cumbersome to get into and does not correct my posture as advertised.  Disappointing.
3.0,"This cloak looks so nice in the photos...that is not the case. I'm not sure what you would call this fabric, but it feels kind of like cheap craft felt. It does have an inside lining, which makes it a little thicker, but not better looking or feeling. The pockets are in a really weird spot. First, they are up too high. I'm only 5ft and have short arms, and they seem too high to me, right about the same height as my belly button. On my 6'2"" husband, they hit right below his chest. It just feels off. Secondly, they are too close to the opening in the front, so the lining of the pockets aren't covered by the cloak, especially when you have your hands in the pockets, and since there's no closure on the cloak, you can't keep it closed to cover the pockets. (which I thought was weird. I've never owned a cloak that didn't have a closure.) I thought this was more of like an every day wear kind of cloak, but it's more like a cheaply made halloween cloak."
3.0,"Cheap polyester, washes poorly"
3.0,"I've carried round key rings for years and was in need of a replacement. This one serves its purpose but lacks in quality. The cut and stitch of the ""leather"" is uneven and the clasp that secures your keys to the ring does not lock which makes me feel uneasy. The slightest pressure can open the clasp, and send your keys to the ground. The door opener is useful and pretty sturdy."
3.0,"Poor cut for me, the fabric is thin, pretty patterns and colors"
3.0,"These socks kept my feet warm but I am usually a women's size 8 - I got the small, which is supposed to fit to a women's size 7. It is not that they are too long, they are so wide at the toes."
3.0,"I loved the look of the blouse online, but didn't like the front of the blouse, too boxy. I ordered an extra large, and it was a little too fitted."
3.0,Everyone loved this dress and asked me where I got it. It was very tight in the arms though. I am a size medium but I purchased a large and it was still tight
3.0,"I do not care for the fit as much as a different brand I also purchased.<br />I will keep it and wear it around the house, but over all this product was not exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,Cute but even too small for my almost 2 year old
3.0,No me gustó mucho la calidad de la impresión. Se veía más dorada pero como un amarillo simple pero la calidad de la gorra es buena.<br /><br />I didn’t like much the printing quality. I thought it was like gold color but it is a poor yellow color instead. The cap quality cloth is good tho.
3.0,The fit was as expected. Color fades after 3 washes.
3.0,much smaller than I expected. picture is a little deceiving but they are beautiful
3.0,It was just ok. Look much cuter online. It fit ok.
3.0,"Great looking watch but the face is way too big! It’s a shame but I’ll be too embarrassed to wear it out in public. Seems to be a quality watch, but it’s ridiculously too big."
3.0,Wasn't as flattering as expected
3.0,Was thinner material then I’d hoped for
3.0,"Run about two sizes smaller than indicated. Too small for my son, not worth returning."
3.0,"Pretty but not worth the money spent. I wish the pictures showed the back (which I thought looked exactly like the front), the heart is hollow with a metal design on the back. I bought this as a gift and it's just not at all what I was expecting."
3.0,"are not the same earrings that arrived, look nothing like picture. i got plan hoops with no diamonds, kind of disappointed dont buy unless you want plan hoops"
3.0,"Pendant is pretty good but adjustable chain part of necklace and clasp is very cheap I can see it breaking very easily. Also even adjusted  all the way out it does not hang very low, only 2 fingers can fit between pendant and neck. I will probably end up purchasing longer and better necklace to put pendant on"
3.0,Fabric is really thin and see through. I ended up returning the dress because it was a little too small and too sheer for me.
3.0,This is a very small pendant & and only about 1.5 inches. It did the trick for a Halloween costume but I wouldn't have given it as a gift.  It also arrived in a huge envelope & the pendant was almost bent in half from poor packaging.
3.0,"These were really overpriced but honestly this was the only seller that had them available. They work, but have some residue."
3.0,"It arrived &#34;broken&#34;. Apparently the glue that holds the hook was very weak. Had to put it together with super glue. Hoping that it will keep it together for a while. Overall, good quality piece for the price."
3.0,They’re great...if they would have fit. If you have a larger bottom they’re very low cut from the back. For working out I like things to fit higher up and not need to constantly be lifting.
3.0,The bracelet dose not work like don’t clip in your wist and it get back easily
3.0,"Ended up returning it because of the slit too high, it was a bit tight for a medium and the material was see-through but it is nice for night party."
3.0,Fit a little big.  Didn't read the description apparently to know it was a fitted hat.
3.0,"The pendant is  pretty but just a bit big.  The chain is pretty too, but the nickel in it really reacts to my skin and it stinks.  Can't  use the chain.  Nevertheless, with St Patrick's Day coming, I'm glad I got it."
3.0,I had great difficulty zippering the back of garment.  It also appeared baggy.
3.0,"Cute shirt, but didn’t expect it to be totally polyester. Size is much larger than expected and due to the fabric type, it won’t shrink when washed."
3.0,"I gave this a 3. This could be an amazing backpack. Its comfortable,  even with 15kilos of wet sandy stuff. However, if it's going to be a travel/hiking pack,  it really needs to be made out of more flexible materials. There is no give/flexibility in the material its constructed out of. No elasticity in the side net pockets. So they tear very very easily.<br />These rips occurred the first time I put my water bottle and a map in the pocket.<br /><br />Also the material in main part of the bag, needs more give. It's very hard to load the bag to max capacity, especially with rigid objects like snorkels and fins, when the material isn't flexible.  Makes it pull too much on the zippers. My much smaller hiking pack can hold almost the equivalent of this bag. (Except for long rigid stuff, like my fins, for snorkling.<br /><br />I saw a lot about the zippers, in previous comments. Mine held up fine on my 8 day trip. (They do get caught easily on the material of the bag. But didnt seem to compromise their effectiveness)<br /><br />So my conclusion is, not really a overly practical long trip hiking bag, but worth the $35.00, if you are going on short day hike to do stuff like snorkling.  Where you have large rigid supplies that need to be carried it. You can even put a very small food cooler in the bottom compartment. And carrying out your wet used stuff will feel almost as light as when you hiked in."
3.0,"This really should've been a five star review. I ordered this to touch up the birkstocks that I've had for a year. When the bottle arrived it was clearly used and had product dripped on and around the lid. It was mostly full, though, so I used it and now my shoes look fantastic. The product deserves five stars, but you can't sell open and used stuff and treat it as new."
3.0,These elastics work well<br />For holding small braids in my older daughter they certainly are not for fine baby hair as they immediate fall out. Colors are pretty and many come in a pack
3.0,"I was really disappointed with this. I have slimmer wrists for a guy and I still have it on loosest setting and it is a bit tight. But biggest issue is the light barely works at all. When I depress the button I can tell the hour if I hold it at the correct angle, but that's it. I like it alright for daytime use. It is retro-stylish and sharp, but for even dim lighting use it is horrid."
3.0,"Adorable outfit! The the bottoms fit true to size,  but the top was much smaller."
3.0,"Not very flattering, looks like a maternity shirt"
3.0,It doesn't smell like wool. It may be acrylic or a wool acrylic mix.
3.0,It broke very quickly
3.0,"Cute idea but I was not expecting built in underwear. I was planning to wear as a skirt over my bikini bottoms, so I would need to cut out the sewn-in bottoms if I wanted to wear it. Sent it back instead."
3.0,Not as long as I thought it was. The hooks are more bronze than gold. It's not bad.
3.0,"Cute but I don’t think they’re worth $30... also they run a little on the small side, they kind of make my butt look flat. In my opinion, there are better leggings here on Amazon for a better price."
3.0,"This bracelet is as adorable and cute as I expected it to be based on the stock photos provided.<br /><br />I bought this at Full Price as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine who loves her religion. It didnt take as long as I expected for it to get here. It actually arrived a week before it was scheduled to.<br />I am giving 3 starts because the connecting chain on the bracelet is cheap. It pulls apart. I thought it had a cheap feel. So with just a little pressure on the chain it snapped apart. It was easily put back together.<br />I am still going to give this to her. The price is good. And the leather and bracelet charms are nice and well made. Even tho the chain pulls apart, if you are not heavily active I dont think there is going to be an issue. She is also a very tiny thing. I dont forsee her giving this bracelet much wear and tare. Which will probably last a good while for her."
3.0,"Did not last long before the ear strap broke. I gave it a 3 because it does look great, just wish it would have lasted longer then one month."
3.0,I purchased these pamts in a size large.  These pants are a medium.  They are definitely mis-sized.
3.0,It's kind of painful and doesn't stay on well. It also doesn't fit my ear quite right.
3.0,Ordinaria
3.0,são frágeis! duas já não funcionam mais!
3.0,"I like the design, but the glasses are not sturdy. The glasses seem cheap and feel like the frame would break very easily. Unfortunate because I bought another brand that were similar and had about the same price but were much sturdier and solid. The design looks better in the gold then the silver. I bought both colored frames. Also, the gold frames seem stronger."
3.0,Xl is usually snug on me and xxl is a little loose on me and I got a 3x and it’s snug and top is tiny compared to picture. The robe is comfy though. Material sheds a lot. Would probably have skipped this set.
3.0,"Las dos banderas son cubanas pero son del mismo brazo, deberían invertirlas a la hora de hacerlas para q cada una correspondiera a un brazo diferente. Por lo demás, veo el precio acorde con la calidad del producto."
3.0,"Well, I ordered the black one and it fit as expected size wise. ( I'm normally a US small and I bought a small. 5 foot 6 I range from 113-123 lbs 36 27 35) And I was very happy to see that unlike the last dress I bought, the pockets were hidden in the dress like they should be and not sticking out all crazy, though they were a little higher than they should be. I could deal with that, but not this weird gapping at the top of the dress. I've seen this mentioned in other reviews but honestly I thought maybe it was just people buying a size too big. Nope. I see what they mean now. Doesn't matter how big your chest is because it's above the breast area. This thing fits like a glove except the space between where the strap ends and my armpit. It kind of juts out not matter how I adjust the strap. It's less noticeable if I shorten the straps all the way but that's not how I'd like to wear it, especially with the pockets already being a little too high. I considered having it altered but I'm not sure if it can be corrected and doesn't seem worth the expense. I think this is just another knock off with a stock photo&#62; my quest for a simple maxi dress with pockets continues."
3.0,The buckle is adequate in quality but the leather feels cheap--it has an odd stamped pattern instead of a higher quality leather.
3.0,"This dress is cute in person, the green is pretty. However, after MUCH ironing, upon it's wrinkled arrival, I tried it on and it's completely see-through. It's a bit snug in the front portion of the skirt. I am a curvy lady, 5'8 and wear a size 12 or 14 US. I bought an XL in this dress. If you buy this, be prepared to wear a slip under it. And since it's summertime at the beach, the last thing I want to do is wear a slip."
3.0,"The sizing is off, I thought I bought an xl and I received a large because they go by numbers. An xl is a 16-18. Overall, looks good but it’s not my favorite bathing suit."
3.0,"Very cute, tight bottoms, loose top though."
3.0,Thought purse was white- but it was a cream color
3.0,These were very flimsy and poorly made.  certainly not for a girl with any large boobs.  I can't says as I would order again considering the cheap material and poor support.<br />I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
3.0,seam causes a camel toe but very comfy
3.0,This product runs small. Recommend to go up at least 1 size.
3.0,No lose siento como que me decepcionó ya que está muy simple
3.0,Runs large but cute design
3.0,"I felt it looked better online than in person, because I am a Saints fan, I will not return it, but it is very masculine in person, and not as feminine as I thought it would look."
3.0,Fits big but  I can deal with that BUT extremely wrinkled  upon arrival so now I’m going to take it to the cleaners and have it steamed before I can even wear it.  Very soft material and hangs nice.
3.0,"I thought they would fit my thighs better, but they're amazing once I use them with my garter belt. I pair them with a skater skirt, and they look super cute."
3.0,"I bought this as a beanie style hat for running, and liked the idea of the sunglasses holder. When I first tried it on it didn't fit well. I think I have a normal sized head but it was too big to fit nicely and also was shaped kind of goofy. I returned to Amazon."
3.0,Nice hat but the grey-us has silver glittery like yarn though it.  It shows a man but has more of a girl look to it.  Also it is very small-  perfect for kids but right on adult.  Nice fuzzy inside
3.0,"I wear a size 8 and these barely fit.  They are also very thin, I can see my skin through the ones with white on them."
3.0,"Pit bull message written in reverse.  Although now that I look closely at the pics, I see it is as pictured. But often photos online show in reverse.  Not a big deal, but not as expected."
3.0,They fit sort of on the larger side. Very thick as well. Not much of a compression sock though
3.0,I would not recommend purchase. It comes off to me as costume jewelry. Very inauthentic<br />And toy machine like. The glitter falls off. It makes a great jewelry box decoration
3.0,"Swimsuit was really nice, but not enough coverage on the sides"
3.0,It was a bit too big and didn't lay right on me. I returned it bc they don't have extra small. A little see through as well.
3.0,These are cute! The quality is just ok. The inner sole is awkward and hard to straighten before putting baby's foot in.
3.0,Luv mg collection but this ones a little small
3.0,"This was my 2nd replacement band from the same vender. The original and first replacement leather bands each lasted 1 1/2 yrs. The band cracks badly at the buckle point when taking off watch. At this point, my watch is not worth the cost of any futher expensive watch bands. I would be weary to buy a watch with such a proprietary band in the future. If these bands were made by Seiko , Seiko has a leather problem."
3.0,Meh. The cap itself was good and the band stayed in place fairly well but was just too snug for my big ol' melon! It made the edges of my ears hurt like all get put the whole next day. I'm sure once the band stretched out some it would've been ok but I couldn't make it that long. I ended up returning them and just using a satin scarf that I can adjust myself.
3.0,These were pretty comfortable but I was looking for something more cushiony for heel pain.  If I added an insole they didn't fit right.  Great shoes if you have normal feet with no pain.
3.0,"Unfortunately, these were not long enough for my 11 year old.  Totally bummed and hoping to find something longer."
3.0,thin material and part of back was sewn into waist hem by mistake i fixed then looked nice as described.
3.0,I like the earrings but they are larger than what I expected. I like lightweight earrings so that they don’t stretch the hole in my ear. They are not what I’d call heavy but they are heavier than what I like to wear. I think they would be much cuter in they were about 1/2 the size that they are. My personal opinion is that look kinda gaudy because of the size.
3.0,"Charm selection is meh and quality is okay. I purchased these to jazz up some friendship bracelets I purchased for the school store. Some charms are thick, some are thin, and the same applies to the jumper rings. I received a lot of homely looking sea horses, green octopuses, and some horribly ugly purple hot dog in a bun charm. Not to offend those who may enjoy a purple hot dog, but I don't know anyone that would really want that charm.<br /><br />Out of the 100 charms, one can expect about 75 decent ones."
3.0,"Very soft,and light. Very comfortable. Im tall and usually get away with ordeeing sweaters in large and they fit good. But the sleeves were almost 2in short when my arms were down to my sides. Not sure why but maybe this is for more petite women. Not average or tall. Great sweater."
3.0,"Glad I followed the measurements, I have some hips and a bigger bottom so I got a medium. I opened the dress up and noticed some unraveling pieces, not happy with that at all, this was a bit pricey expected better quality!!! I wanted to add also I didn’t get the cigarette or the gloves smh, really disappointed in this order, DEFINITELY didn’t get what I paid for!!"
3.0,"I like the shirt a lot, its pretty and looks well made. I was upset that I ordered purple and received red. Oh well, it happens!"
3.0,"I wear an xl and J bought a 2x and it didn't fit, nice otherwise."
3.0,I ordered a 3x...they are more like a large or extra large. :(
3.0,"Shirt product shots and description implies a casual, comfy fit top but in reality it leans more formal.<br /><br />The cut off the button opening is such that it only looks right when buttoned up.  The casual opened short look isn’t possible because it just closes itself and looks like you forgot to button it.  You can kinda fold it over but .. see pic.<br /><br />The material feels sturdy but isn’t particularly soft or comfortable.<br /><br />There’s some questionable stitching here and there.<br /><br />Overall.. it’s not a BAD top but it just doesn’t really reflect the vibe of the product shots.<br /><br />My wife asked why I got a priest top and if I wanted white fabric for the collar.."
3.0,"Looks longer in the ad, which is why I purchased it."
3.0,"Cheap quality, but you get what you pay for. They are still cute, and although most of them have broken by now, at least they weren't costly."
3.0,Shirt was a perfect fit but the plastic strings that makes the ruffles around the collar and wrist was broken and sticking out
3.0,Husband liked but they did not last long.
3.0,"these holders are not very good. The rubber bands on them slip on the arm of the eyeglass, but they slip off. They don't hold on very well."
3.0,5’2 100lbs and a small is like a junior xs. Definitely size up
3.0,No what I w looking for an runs small
3.0,The black bottom color is washed out and chipped.
3.0,This suit is....okay. The fabric is a little weird and not like the stretchy bathing-suit material I'm used to. It feels a lot more like a dance recital costume than a bathing suit.
3.0,"Cute, somewhat small if you gave wide wrist"
3.0,Lasted a month or two before they started ripping in half at the top. Not good for heavy use. Waterproof though.
3.0,"Cute dress, but it stinks! The dress fits really well and I like the flowy style, so I'm hoping if I wash it in baking soda I can kill the rough smell. The fabric is very thin, but there are two layers so it's not see through (in the navy color)."
3.0,"If you dont have a small nose, keep looking. Loved the look, just didnt fit"
3.0,Casual cover up but color much lighter than the photo
3.0,"It doesn't look exactly as pictured, but it's still cute."
3.0,One pair was ripped up the side....looks more like there quality control screwed up.....it was a seam that wasn't sewed up.
3.0,Not what I expected. The boot itself is made of very soft material. Boot is narrow.
3.0,"I loved this umbrella. Thought it was a great find. We used it a few times, kept in inside when not in use. I set it up on a nice day. Not windy-maybe a small breeze. I stepped inside and heard a noise. My whole patio table had blown over and my new umbrella was snapped in half. The company and amazon offered to replace it-i accepted but the color was on backorder. They graciously refunded my money. I loved the style and color but the pole was pretty flimsy. Super disappointed."
3.0,Need larger sizes like 10/11
3.0,I was a little disappointed about this necklace. It was more like a choker and I don’t remember reading that. The bracelet was ok. Didn’t return it because I decided to gift it to someone else.
3.0,I purchased this product/bags for less than the amount in return of my honest and unbiased review.<br />I kinda didn't like the texture and the stitching. But I love the color.
3.0,"It is a very comfortable skirt. The guidance foe the size order wasn't too clear, so I ordered a medium. I am a five foot,six inch, 116lb woman. My waist measurement is 28.5 inches. I do however have a habit of wearing clothes on my hips, which are 35.5 inches. The result of the medium purchase was a skirt falling lower every step I took. I had to go to the store mid-work day to buy elastic to tighten up the waist/hip area."
3.0,I bought this product for my wife that's a really good product but I noticed it was cracked on the back she says it's fine but I'm going to include this in the review but all in all I think it's a really good product
3.0,The product seems to work OK but the zipper in the case that holds it broke right away.
3.0,Not teen size as described. Bought for a gift luckily able to keep since they fit my toddler.<br />They are good for hours on screen due to virtual learning.
3.0,As I said before no matter how many dryer sheets you sheets you use it clings to itself and you
3.0,"Bought to provide an alternative to the leather band provided for the Huawei Android Watch.<br />The band seems fine, but lacks the quick-release pin that makes swapping bands on the Huawei Watch easy.<br />I returned the Ritchie band and bought a replacement with the quick-release pins."
3.0,The fabric was very very thin not like a real hoodie. Definately not a winter hoodie.
3.0,Material is nice but the sizing is a little off. Made a little bit too small
3.0,"For the price, these glasses are great! They are similar, if not stronger, quality to sunglasses at the same price point of a drugstore or no-name fashion store in a mall. They are sturdy and come with a soft bag to keep them scratch-free. However, the photo on white background seems to be warped to give them a not as dramatic cat-eye appearance. I don't mind a little flair but when I put these on they were way more dramatic than they appeared to be. In my attached photo I raised my eyebrows to show how high the corners flair. These glasses are great for those who work the retro look or those looking for a costume accessory. It's much too dramatic for me. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"Am I the only one that noticed the lack of a heart-shape on these??  I bought the black/silver pair.  I am observant, and I didn't want to be picky, but I was slightly disappointed because when I first received these sunglasses, I immediately noticed the curvy shape to it.  It didn't exactly match the picture on the website.  The top-center of the heart, where it's supposed to close in more sharply as shown in the product images, was actually smooth and curved which kind of takes away the heart-shape.  A little hard to explain, so see the customer photo I attached.<br />After awhile, I got used to them and didn't bother to return the pair.  Also, they are quite sturdy and can be kept well with the provided drawstring pouch.  I would like the gold pair, but I'm afraid it will be the same result."
3.0,"I mistakenly thought the band loop was for a 22 mm watch band. But the other reviewer is correct. The ones I received were far too loose where they needed to be placed. It's a bit of a guessing game. Guess small. I'll try to return, I suppose."
3.0,"I am obsessed with this outfit! I got a XL to be safe and it fit perfectly! Due to me being short, it was more like pants instead of capri’s. What I can say is if you plan on sitting somewhere hot for a long period of time, this isn’t the outfit for you because the material started to make my thighs feel like they were burning due to the sweat and it rubbing against my skin! But besides outside dinner-the rest of the night I was so comfortable and received so many compliments!"
3.0,"The dress is cute..<br /><br />The polka dots seem a lot larger in person than in pictures. The quality of the dress is nothing to write home about, so it will make sure for an easy summer dress<br /><br />If your busty order up!"
3.0,"The only reason I'm taking 2 stars away is because I was stressing about whether or not I was going to have to return it or not. I wear a large to an extra large in U.S. sizes. I ended up getting a 4x and I can't button it. But I didn't want it buttoned any way, the only reason I got it was because I have strapless maxi dresses for spring and I needed something for the top, so this worked great! If it wasn't for the sizing, I would have given 5 stars! It's exactly as pictured except it's more cropped than you would think. I do love it though!! Came super fast with prime!"
3.0,"Nice, comfy but the neck which is symmetrical won’t stay down like in the picture so it keeps standing up on your neck."
3.0,"I ordered and received both hats - the Riley and the Harper.  But neither are what I expected, based on the pictures.  Both hats include a pepto pink color.  The Harper appears to incude fuschia and pale yellow color flowers in the picture on amazon. And the Riley appears to be a lavender and white rose but it too has just a pepto pink color.  Also the green leaves are just little ovals and don't really look like the pointed leaves in the pictures.  And the flowers are definitely much smaller than they appear in the pictures.  I guess I just expected that the product I received would look like what was marketed, instead I feel that I got a cheaper hat made with cheap materials by someone with no creativity or attention to product detail.  The colors really are just sooooo basic.  I had really hoped for two pretty hats.  I'm disappointed and would not recommend these two hats to others."
3.0,2XL was too big for me size 29. material is nice and color looks good
3.0,"This is a beautiful necklace with a very delicate and pretty chain. When I ordered this, I was unable to find the length of the chain mentioned anywhere on the description page. I ordered it anyway and when it arrived I was quite disappointed to find that the chain is only 15 inches. It is more like a choker on me than a necklace. It would be fine for a young girl but is too small for me. I thought I could put a different chain on it but the original one will not thread through the opening of the circle.<br /><br />Everything else about this necklace is great. It comes in a small zippered case with a care card. I hope the seller updates the information to show the length of the chain."
3.0,"Love this set., looks just like the picture. And I have no complaint about the blue stones. They all match perfectly. Love the blue and silver!&#34;"
3.0,Using the Vibram recommended sizing this shoe is too small will have to return!
3.0,Really like the glasses they sent....however buyer beware glasses in the picture are NOT the glasses sent! They are not aviator style at all!! Luckily I still liked them so I didn't return
3.0,Runs a full size small
3.0,"The images are beautiful, but don't get them wet. The color will bleed (Please see photos.). Also, I'm not sure how to get out the creases. I should have examined the images more closely. Some of them have grammatical mistakes in the caption. And, if you use the blue tacky stuff to hang your posters, it might show through the fabric in the lighter areas of the posters (Please see photos.)."
3.0,Wish it came in a v-neck. Does not look like the image when trying to tie a side knot
3.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and this is the perfect length for me without shoes on. I was excited to have this come in to maybe wear on the 9 hour plane ride for our honeymoon. There are also very deep pockets on the sides which is a nice touch! It was a bit odd how it was cut though.. the left side was 2 inches shorter on the top than the right. I actually got my measuring tape out to measure it. I contacted the vendor to ask for them to send me a replacement. They immediately said that I should just order another one and they will refund the cost. I said okay, I was fine with that as an option. Then they requested my new order number before sending the refund. I said that I wasnt going to purchase it a second time until I received the refund. They then said they would only refund half of it before I purchased it and then would refund the other half. I was pretty confused, because obviously the item that I received was defective. Why do I have to go through this process when the item wasn't made correctly? Overall, I stopped responding to the vendor as I didn't feel comfortable moving forward. I may donate this item instead."
3.0,"Okay, not great"
3.0,"The Inside of the hood does feel slightly uncomfortable. I have a medium & the pants are slightly hard to walk in ,the waist is a little tight & the hood does not tighten u have to tie it which Sucks but it gets the<br />Job done!"
3.0,"Material is very nice, but the stiching is poor. So far i have opened 5 pairs and after washing, 2 of them started losing their stiching at the waist. So the waist elastic and and cloth started separating. Color is not bright white, but off white. That's why they call it as luxury white. I wish they could charge more and make it better. Also, as someone has written in the review that there were loose threads all over boxers, that is correct. They didn't care to remove those threads. These are all the reason they are selling at this cheap price. You get, what you pay.<br /><br /> [[ASIN:B00XYZZJDQ Joseph Abboud Men's 12 Pack Cotton Classic Woven Boxers (Large, 12PK - LUXURY WHITE)]]"
3.0,I went up a few sizes like suggested so it fit ok. I usually wear a large so I got a 2X it not a bad looking hoodie. Not my favorite by all means but for the price its descent.
3.0,I am a bigger chested girl and was hoping for the best. It is like ALMOST big enough and I ordered an XL. The arms were also a bit tight. The color however is very cute and vibrant!
3.0,Works ok but disappointed that it said it can’t be washed. Haven’t used it enough to know lifespan.
3.0,"The socks run a bit small. They are supposed to be one size fits all but if you have a large foot...forget it. Otherwise,  the socks look quite nice."
3.0,"Great price, not great quality"
3.0,i havent put them on bracelet as yet but as they are they are as in picture..hopefully will be updating this review
3.0,I really like the idea But It will not stay put and it drives me crazy so I can't wear it..
3.0,"dont get me wrong, this is well made nice and strong my problem is too bulky, it protect the sun glass well butt take huge space I got it to keep it in my car since is too big it sits in closet"
3.0,the buttock area is way to short
3.0,"My chest was just too big to close the buttons on this dress :( I could button the dress but &#34;gaposis&#34; strikes again.<br />I'm an 38I cup, took a chance and loss. Normally I can get away with it if the dress has a good amount of stretch but this was very stiff and  structured. I really love it but unfortunately back it goes."
3.0,"I was disappointed the clock doesn't illuminate. I got this for my son so he can tell what time it is and whether offer not he can get out of bed, but he can't see it in the dark."
3.0,"Too short for my liking. Falls awkwardly above mya ankle.(I'm 5""9) The red and white lines to not line up, the waist is sewn crooked, but not very noticable. Not sure if I will return or get hemmed to a more flattering length."
3.0,"The velvet is very thick and stretchy. Feels like it would make a really great winter robe, not so great for a dress. Maybe, I just ordered the wrong size and there was just too much fabric. It could be a great dress with the proper fit. I actually would suggest sizing down one if you don’t need too much extra tummy room. The fabric definitely stretches."
3.0,The elastic is not strong
3.0,This robe is absolutely stunning and is perfect for the summer months. I have had mine for a few months now and it is already starting to come apart though. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Very small to size described. 😩
3.0,"This dress is very thin, but it has a short slip underneath that helps. The color is a light tan and it looks great by itself or with a jean jacket. The material wrinkles easily but if you dry it on a low setting and take it out of the dryer right away, ironing isn't necessary. I got a few nice compliments when I wore it to our church event.  The dress is true to size."
3.0,"Our son is deaf and for his daddy's celebration of life he wore this mask, very hot and foggy as he wore this."
3.0,"Design and feel of fabric is nice, but when I hang this outside my purse, opening is on an angle, and there's no closure, so my glasses can slip out. (and has once)"
3.0,"The tree of life earrings are great, the other ones so cheap and instantly made my ears itchy"
3.0,The picture showed two gloves with digging claws but it is only the right hand glove that has digging claws. Disappointed
3.0,These a little tight but I think that’s because the material is not very stretchy. I wouldn’t wear these while working out because they do feel a little stiff when bending. The color is nice and true to the picture.
3.0,Came with kinks in both of them.
3.0,Pretty but need to order a size larger.
3.0,The skirt was not as full as I thought it would be. Tight fit across the chest. Good length and the fabric breathes well.
3.0,These pants are ok.
3.0,Loved the shirt but ran small and the material was itchy.
3.0,"So, I was extremely excited to get these in the mail, but once I compared them to my regular plugs, these felt a lot smaller. Not only are they shorter, but the flare is smaller. As someone who wanted to stretch my ear, and loved going up in sizes, these make me feel as if I've gone down in size.  For that, I would rate these a 3."
3.0,Shoes do not fit like size 11 going to have to return and size up.
3.0,Very cheaply made don’t waste your time or money.
3.0,I got these gloves specifically to use when I'm snow blowing as I thought the heating feature would help my hands stay warm. The gloves were shipped in a plastic zip lock bag without any type of instructions. I unzipped the battery pouches on the gloves only to find two cheap plastic battery holders each requiring 3 AA batteries to power up the gloves rather than normal rechargeable lithium batteries with a charger. I inserted the three AA batteries into the battery packs and then turned the gloves on. While they did manage to power up the gloves the heat they produced  was pretty anemic and I doubt they will last longer than a couple hours before going dead. The gloves themselves are fairly well made but not very insulated so hopefully I can finish snow blowing the driveway before they no longer generate heat. I'm not overly impressed with these gloves and think a better insulated glove with hand warmers tucked inside would be better. These aren't nearly as expensive as other heated gloves but with those you get longer lasting rechargeable lithium batteries and a charger. My feeling is that it would be better to pay more and get a better heated glove.
3.0,"I purchased this dress as I've gained a little (read:a lot) of weight during COVID times. I am 5'2"" and weigh 170lbs. I purchased a medium, knowing the fit is baggy. It was a little big for my taste. I have a 36 DD and even with tying it in the back, it was a little too loose in the chest area, which doesnt provide any support, and during the summer I'm trying to not wear undergarments as much as possible. Of course everyone's body type and aesthetic taste is different. If I would purchase again I would size down for me. I also am fully aware that as a curvy, short human being, this dress was not going to look like it does on the skinny and tall stock models in the picture. Other than this, the material feels sturdy. It is a little fuzzy and thicker than I thought, but not too thick to not wear it in August in LA."
3.0,"Very warm, not breathable, covers too much of my face."
3.0,Wierd material.. very itchy
3.0,Cute. My 14 year old daughter really liked it. Kind of chintzy though.
3.0,not bad but still cheaply made cant say much else
3.0,"There are 4 pairs of shorts - 2 black and 2 gray. (92% polyester, 8% spandex) Black shorts are uncomfortably tight and ride up the crotch. I would still be okay to work out, but I kept sliding of the seat of my bike and had to adjust every 15 seconds, which got old pretty quick. The mesh on them was rubbing on my skin irritatingly. The other 2 grey pairs of shorts fit just right, were very comfortable and the mesh inserts didn't bother me at all. But they too are not great for bike exercise but okay for any other workout that does not require sitting on any machine. 50/50."
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this dress. It is indeed pretty for the price. But the lace looks very cheap. Also I usually wear a size 6 dress, so I ordered a size 8 to make sure it would fit, and it is too small for me to zip up completely. I'm going to have to alter the back in order for it to fit correctly. However, it came in the mail quickly and I love the style of the dress."
3.0,I might have been able to live with the line in the middle of the shirt if the shirt itself wasn't too small.
3.0,I guess you get what you pay for. 38.00 with shipping. Really crappy packaging. 1 thin layer of bubble wrap then placed in a thin plastic shipping envelope. Not very comfortable. Laces are like plastic. They look super cheap. Definitely returning these.
3.0,"The suit is a little hard to put on, but then there was a funny bunch up of material in the front like the sewing machine gathered extra material.  The inside bra has a white cotton base around it and is also white material and it folds forward and shows.  I have not been able to figure out how to keep the white fabric from showing."
3.0,Completely forgot to review! Really loved this bag outside of the fact that it had a stain on it. I ordered the yellow one and it’s a beautiful color. Just wish it wasn’t stained! Hopefully it’ll come out in the wash though. Will update.
3.0,These tanks have a good fit but they roll up a lot. I pull them down a lot during the day. But if I'm at home I wear them as bras and they keep everything in place.
3.0,I’m not sure if it’s because of their length or the way they hang but I just don’t care for the look of these earrings once I’m wearing them.  I love pearls but these aren’t the ‘dainty’ classy earrings I thought they’d be
3.0,Was way too long but no way to return being home bound so cut the bottom off. Love the material!
3.0,El color tal cual la foto.<br />Pero la tela mucho nailon.
3.0,"My daughter is 8 and wheres a size 6-7. She should have fit in the size 7-8, but not the case. They were way too small and too tight! Order a size bigger!!"
3.0,Xl runs small
3.0,handy little item for placing small to medium size handbags at your table instead of the arm chair.
3.0,It is spandex I would not have purchased had I realized that. It's longer than I thought as well. Still need to try on with leggings to see if it looks any better. Maybe returning this one.
3.0,The earrings were too bulky.
3.0,Pretty disappointed because I’m missing Mary I only got these because I wanted the Hocus Pocus ones. They are really cute but defeats the point with out having all the sisters.
3.0,"it's ok and easy to replace, but the top edge does not line up even with the watch face.  it sits up just enough to be noticed.  Also, the instructions don't tell you to remove the Bluetooth device from your old band before you toss it (like I did).  The band is also very stiff and it's challenging to lock down the band with the little attached device that slips in the slots."
3.0,They are really cute and seem well made but a little too heavy for my small earlobes.
3.0,After first wash a run was on my the green shorts also don’t bend over can see right thru to your underwear
3.0,Beautiful rings. But Turned fingers green.
3.0,It is a Little bit big
3.0,"It looks as depicted and good materials overall, my problem was the sleeves run a little long and they are super wide, especially closing in to the shoulders so it looks bulky. Sadly I had to give mine away because I wasngonna wear it like that"
3.0,It made my head itchy
3.0,It was tank tops with spegetti straps Im wearing them any way it shows my bra then i have to pull it up and back I've got to put a couple tacs in my strap so it will stay in place.
3.0,"The look great, I love that the necklace can be adjustable from the front, but... The material is very flimsy. The leaves of the necklace as well as the earrings. So you must be very careful while wearing them, because they can fold out curve easily. I bought this set to go with a hand chain, that one hasn't arrived yet so I can't compare, but with the set, there's that."
3.0,"I wear XL, this XL was more like a large than  an extra large.  I didn't return it because I needed it to show-off to my grandkids"
3.0,"The glasses have an interesting design for a good price and fits well.<br />It's lightweight and well made. The accessories that comes together are also good and usefull.<br />I just don't fell confortable with it to use when exposed to the sun. It reflects my skin and eyes on the inside of the lens, making me fell like it's dirty. Really bugs me."
3.0,"This necklace does not look as luxurious as it did in the picture. The chain looked faded before I even work it, especially the tassels. Guess I'll get over it, being that it was less than $5 , so what could you really expect."
3.0,"I read the reviews being advised to order up a sz. I wear a<br />10, so ordered a XL. It's a tight. I'm so disappointed. I like it so much. will buy something bigger in this sz. By the way, weigh 125 lbs am 5"" 6"". Really thought it would wor. Either return it or give to .My neighbor.<br />I love everything else. It's got a quality look + feel.A<br />GR8 robe. DOES run small"
3.0,"Cute, nice belt but received broken !!"
3.0,"Color, soft material are as expected, but does not hang as pictured; much more material. I am 5'4&#34;, 117, and it fits a bit longer than the pic too."
3.0,It is shaped like a box and the black color was not black.  I kept it and it is very comfortable. It isn't black like the picture. Is a shiny fabric. It's ok though so I kept it.
3.0,"I bought this for myself and it is a little too small, found out later that it’s sold out in all sizes. I’ll be gifting it to my daughter and hopefully she’ll love it."
3.0,It fits very large.
3.0,Band not super flexible or comfortable. A little bulky. Cute but not great for everyday wear.
3.0,The bottons r coming off when I get the shirt
3.0,"Watch is likely good quality, but finish makes it look cheap.<br />The sanded stainless looks like plastic, the glass is flat, ... design wise not great.<br />It worked out of the box, plain and simple.<br />I you are not looking for this as a a fashion item, go for it."
3.0,Not as comfortable as other blue light blocking glasses i have purchased. I like the light weight.
3.0,"i love the way it looks, but it came apart after only a few wearings"
3.0,Kind of scratchy. More for decoration
3.0,Cute and comfortable but not practical.  I’m a 32C and bought a M.  Definitely was too big and does not support the entire area. Major side boob :/
3.0,It leaks from the bottom but it holds a whole bunch of stuff though so I just put a towel down when in use
3.0,"Nicely designed and shaped. Beautiful light and airy fabric perfect for hot weather, but no lining!"
3.0,Not really worth the price.. the flowers are not all stuck down so the shirt looks cheap.
3.0,"I have unfortunately gained the “covid-15”. I love wearing tennis skirts in the summer but I needed something more flattering and longer length. The length was great, right above the knee. I was disappointed in the waistband. It squeezed the heck out of me and gave me the dreaded muffin-top. I thought the waistband was going to be thicker. It does have a nice pocket on the inside for your cell phone. I think this skirt would work well for some ladies but as I keep most of my weight in the midsection it wasn’t good for me."
3.0,"The quality was ok, a little different than what I expected and ran a little small."
3.0,"Was too large and heavy had to return. But the quality of the purse as a whole is great. If you don’t have back problems and don’t mind the weight this purse is beautiful. The crossover strap doesn’t have its own loops, it’s the same loops to clip to as the shoulder strap. Made it a bit awkward feeling."
3.0,The shirt is a bit short and rides up very easily since it is tight. Wish this were a bit longer as an XXL.
3.0,I bought a pair of these four years ago and they last three years. I never had a better pair and they gave me no problems. I recently bought a second pair after my other set finally wore out. Within six months they clasps have stopped holding...they slide and pop off frequently and the straps losses almost an hour into wearing them. I'm quite dissappointed this time.
3.0,Cheap plastic but served the purpose.
3.0,great jacket. walmart sells them for $15. Fifty bucks is a bit steep for a $15 jacket
3.0,The removable cups are circular rather than triangular and show through the bra and shirts
3.0,It was ok for the price. The picture wasn’t high quality. It just looked like a sheet behind a clear half stone. I could have probably made this myself. I though the inside lens part was plastic but it’s just a printed picture.
3.0,Cheap.  Not worth price but did the job for a party.
3.0,"Cute, but not for a waist belt (which was what I bought it for)."
3.0,Far more see through than I expected
3.0,"Did not like the fact that the neck is uncovered when I'm wearing, the length of it is too short."
3.0,If not for the false advertising I would give them 5 stars. For the price they are very high quality. I was looking for safety glasses with unbreakable lenses for use **during the day**. Why they call them night vision I don't know. They do have very sturdy aluminum frames with spring loaded hinges. The nose piece is adjustable and very comfortable. The hard case is a bonus. You don't typically find these features at this price point. I'm ordering another set for backup.
3.0,Love the color and cotton like material but the neck is like a tight T-shirt. Way too small and I ordered 2 sizes up. If it wasn’t for the neck it would be 5 stars
3.0,"Inexpensive trendy glasses. They fit the bill. However the little metal bits tear my hair out when it's pulled back (it's really hot out) and I put them on or off. Not glasses you can wear on your hair. Aaaand the arm is about to break off, 3 stars"
3.0,"would like to return but apparently I missed the return date by one day.  I cannot figure out how the wrap tie works.  So the dress is not useful to me.  Any chance I can return it!<br />The material and dress is pretty, just no way to do the wrap!"
3.0,It did break easy by the clasp
3.0,This was too small for me and the material was not what I was expecting.  This might have been great for someone that didn't just have a baby or immediately looses all their baby weight.  I ended up giving mine to Good Will.
3.0,"These might be wide enough to go over prescription glasses if you have a set of ""granny glasses"" , compact frames, or a really narrow head.  They're alright for the money, but don't do the required job of fitting over glasses of normal frame widths."
3.0,"I liked the color and pattern and overall style of the dress however. I sized up to make the armholes fit , but then the front was too open! Would see the entire bralette I wanted to wear. I ordered a medium. I’m 5,0  with more muscular bulky arms and smaller chest."
3.0,"I was hoping it was longer, but it's hard to tell when you buy online."
3.0,"The stitching on these gloves leaves something to be desired. Around the thumb and second finger the fabric feels as if it was applied after the glove was made, this leaves an odd feeling seam which needs pulled down from time to time to the base of the thumb. slightly annoying,and feels like a factory second/blem. this does not affect the warmth or the functionality of the glove and the ability to use my iphone is why they have not been returned."
3.0,"Ordered up a size, good thing, runs slightly small. Removed the ties in the back, what's with those? They serve no purpose and look stupid. It's a little high wasted, elastic should be lower. As for weather resistance, will know more after the trip but think it will be windproof and possibly water resistant, but not waterproof. It is light and packable which is perfect for a trip."
3.0,Only issue with this product was it ran small. I even ordered a size bigger than my normal wear. It also shrink after washing it.
3.0,"Lasted less then a year before all the batteries died,  but for the price it’s okay. They worked well while they lasted and I will order again"
3.0,"This is a cute top and fit was good. However the application of the lace on the cruved front not good. I will see if i can fix, if not I may return."
3.0,"I enjoy the fit of the dress and think the cut is very flattering.  The fabric looks a little cheap to me but for the price it's still a decent purchase.  I'm a size 16, 210 lbs, 5'3 size 38 G chest and purchased a 5XL.  The fit is perfect."
3.0,i am a size Medium so i got a Large. It is too tight around my breast. i should have gotten a X Large. they really run small.
3.0,It's okay. Not astounding sound but gets the job done. Only thing I don't like is others can here what I'm listening to
3.0,the collar around the ankle is too high for my taste but is as shown.
3.0,This product seemed so wonderful for a couple weeks that we bought a second one. A week later the fist one broke where the elastic strip attaches to the side bar. I have been using the second pair for about 6 months and broke again at the side bar.  However I have used the first pair to replace the lost bar.
3.0,"Color, soft"
3.0,The material was thinner than what I expected. Other then that the shirt is cool!
3.0,Beautiful ring. Arrived broken... missing stone
3.0,Jacket is very thin but works great in rainy weather. The sleeves were a tad short.
3.0,I felt like it wasn’t as cute in person and I did not like the bow at all. But the color is absolutely beautiful
3.0,"I bought two of these.  Love the band, hate the screws that keep coming loose.  First band lost a screw, I figured it was my fault.  Unable to locate a replacement screw or spring so I bought another.  Same problem happened and I repeatedly checked the screws, but it still came loose and lost another spring.  Good looking, works well, but adapters don’t last for me."
3.0,The fit of these shorts is great but the yellow print looks nothing like the picture.  It's kind of cheap-looking and a weird print.  I kept them anyway.
3.0,This is an ok handbag. It is a little too big for what I need. It has held up well so far (2 months of use).
3.0,My 5 yr old loves this backpack set but the main zipper broke the on day 2. The backpack and accessories are made of typical material. It very lightweight and durable enough for things a kindergartner carries. The color is good.
3.0,I like the fit and fits nicely. Only downside is that I ordered navy and looks more like blue. I wouldn’t consider this navy at all
3.0,"It's shorter than I thought but not too bad, acceptable"
3.0,"The dress is beautiful and seems well made but I ordered an XL after reading the reviews and was confident in my decision...that is until I tried it on. It looked like it might be a little snug so I tried it on as soon as I opened it and was very surprised when I couldn't even button it. I immediately started the returns process and while I was doing that examined the dress to make sure it was good enough quality to try again, thats when I noticed the size tag (which is near the hem line of the lining) it clear as day said small. If I hadn't recieved the wrong size I feel confident that it would be 5 stars. Unfortunately I went to reorder it after getting my return shipping label and its out of stock so I won't actually know now if it is a 5 star worthy dress."
3.0,I need some a little bigger but they are exactly as described!
3.0,5 star as a protestation of all this c19 craziness.<br /><br />4 star for the Steam Punk look<br /><br />3 star because it has actual replaceable fiber filters in the two round side projections.<br /><br />2 star for lack of effective seal<br /><br />1 star for strong plastic smell<br /><br />Overall star rating: Sigma of each criteria rating ÷ number if criteria (equally weighted) = 3
3.0,Very beautiful Leather.  The bag was good except that it had dark stitching instead of white. IMO it made the bag look cheap so I returned it. Very upsetting.
3.0,it's pretty design but it slides down my nose to much the material is nice its thick enough and the filter is great . just wish fit was better .
3.0,I needed compression leggings to be able to work out while recovering from vein surgery.  These are a bit pricey for the compression fit.  They were not as tight as I expected or needed.  This pair does not feel like the other 20-30mmHg tights I have.  I kept them because I can still use them to work out and they do offer more compression than regular work-out pants.
3.0,Awesome but not the best!
3.0,I like the fabric but I found the neck to be quite high and I thought it should be a little lower of a scoop neck on this dress. Otherwise I would have said dress was exactly what I expected. I will still enjoy having a long dress for fall though... I'm a size 14 and this was definately the correct size for me.
3.0,"I really like the size of these huggie earrings but the quality is not good. Hey don't give me wrong, the price is cheap. When I try one pair the earring back broke."
3.0,a little to dark
3.0,The item is excellent but arrived small to my foot.. Im size 9 and purchased same size but arrived small.. that money lost
3.0,Worth the money I spent
3.0,Love the pockets. They fit as expected. They are a bit sheer for my liking.
3.0,"This belt has the honor of being the first elastic belt I've owned that doesn't fit quite right.  I've bought a handful of these things from various sellers, all made in China, but this one it just too small.  I wear an 8 in dresses, about a 28 in the waist, but this one squeezes in an unpleasant manner.  Overall, the quality is great, seems really well put together, stays closed when on, but it's just too small for me."
3.0,Hat is great. However it came completely smashed flat. Was able to work it out with minimal crease in front. Amazon....ship your hats in a box!
3.0,Not as lightweight as we wanted it but it’s a fine jacket.
3.0,"Very cute shirt, but definitely runs small. I ordered the largest size (XXL), I'm normally a size 18-20 U.S. and have large chest. If you like fitted shirts, it'll work for you...but because of the pockets, the fitted look doesn't really look right. This type of tunic really should fit loosely."
3.0,I ordered them for a friend who is a size 10.<br /><br />The socks are too small and also the fabric is very thin and doesn't feel cozy.<br /><br />I'm a size 7.5 and will keep them for myself but I would not order them again.
3.0,"Threading on the collar pins is rough at best.  As a result, the mechanical action of screwing the ends back on is rather scratchy."
3.0,Would be better if it had a cover to help keep everything in place
3.0,"I ordered this band to replace a nylon fabric and leather band that came with the watch. This resin watchband is a good band but takes different size end link &#34;bars&#34; and spring rod &#34;pins&#34; than the fabric/leather one used. These end links and pins were not listed as included with this band, and were not available from this source. I went to &#34;pacparts.com&#34; to order them. This info should help the rest of the reviewers that could not install their bands."
3.0,Great style! This color is super bright!
3.0,"I love this dress, however this is the second one I've returned because upon first iron the color has bleed onto the white (both the red/white and blue/white)."
3.0,"It's thick, and warm.. and itchy.  I really like soft sweaters, but this is not one of them - it's good for a 2nd layer though. One of the pockets seam was loose, but they're a good size. Keys, cell, balls of tissues... it'll fit all in one pocket. I'm 5'1 and petite - it's a bit large on me, but I like it like that. I washed it immediately in cold/gentle and dried on medium heat and it held up well. Even the open pocket seam I didn't bother to fix.... I wear it over another smaller cardigan when I'm cold and it works great."
3.0,"I am 5'9"" 185lbs 36/38B with an athletic build.  I got this in the XL I figured I would need a larger size to accommodate my shoulders, this is pretty common for me.  This fits the way a Medium or Small does on my body.  It  hugs everywhere similarly to athletic material without the compression.<br /><br />The material and cut is very nice but this is NOT for a larger frame person at all.  Petite would probably be better.  So while this is super cute I would not recommend."
3.0,"Really pretty dress, but I had two problems. 1. It ran kinda small & 2. The bust is waaay too small. I couldn’t fit my chest in the area allotted because it’s smaller than it appeared on images here."
3.0,What kind of casual beach dress is professional dry clean only? This one!!! Somehow I missed that.
3.0,Color was a nice red like the picture. Only gripe is with the chests area due to stitching . The dress doesn’t sit properly. It wasn’t bad enough to send back but could be a pain depending on where your going.
3.0,"Unfortunately have to return as they are too small, but the color is great!"
3.0,It’s difficult to get on but looks great.
3.0,"Very pretty blouse, just too big, I should have ordered a Med. but I 'll know for next time, because I'll definitely order again.. Beautiful blouse, nice price.... Just too big."
3.0,Bought a medium and couldn't get it on at all it was way too small.  More like a medium child size.
3.0,They're all really cute. Some of them have a hard clasp that is really difficult to open.
3.0,"The shoes are nice but they run small , my son is almost a 13 and I got a size 1 to stay on the safe side and hoping they would be a little big on him but on the contrary they fit him very precise , one more month and he will outgrow them :("
3.0,Poor material and very uncomfortable. Wish that this was made of better material. looks great when on.
3.0,I love this hat but the shape was all messed up so I can never wear it!
3.0,"My daughter loves the suits, but they are a tad small, difficult to get the top on."
3.0,"Very high waisted- comes up to just under bust, but I just added a wide belt & it looks fine. Material is light, chiffon- like, sophisticated , sexy style."
3.0,"Helmet is very cheap flimsy plastic.  Probably fine for our 7 year olds halloween costume but for $28 I think this is a $2 product. Also, the stickers are really difficult to put on so we'll have to use another set."
3.0,A little tight but pretty.
3.0,I got little broken inside of the watch.
3.0,"I like the umbrella for its small size but it seems a little flimsy like it might not hold up but I can't be sure until the test of time.  Also, it is a little hard to open and close."
3.0,"These are cute if you want to put them in for photos or a special occasion, but otherwise they start to go in weird directions when you're doing normal daily things and dig into the area around them. I have to constantly adjust."
3.0,The suit is unique and cute. I had to fuss with it a bit to get the top right. Tall girls may need to think this one over as the seams of the top part stretch to front of body by shoulders.  You have to stretch it out a bit if you have full bust and wider shoulders like I do. (Inverted triangle) Its a bit tight in bust and upper portion. fits well in lower part of body though.
3.0,"I was disappointed that my daughter ripped these tights in the crotch area after just one wear. It could have been her yanking them up too hard, but she doesn't rip tights that often, so I'm not sure. This came in a two-pack, so I'll see what happens when she wears the second pair."
3.0,I love this brand and have bought a few tank tops from them but this one had a hole in it.
3.0,Color is good. Cut is good. But I have some pilling of the fabric on the inside of the thigh.  I bought medium.
3.0,"Super soft robe. Maybe a tad too thin and does not come in an Lg/XL as stated online. I received a large that fit more like a medium {10 - 12). The return, however, was fast and easy. I would have purchased another one had they had a larger size available"
3.0,"Cheaply Made, the lens does reflect well."
3.0,"This is perfect for St. Patrick's Day, or any time you need some luck! Be ready for the green to hit you, because it's bright! I don't care for the chain, I feel it cheapens the dazzling pendant!"
3.0,"I normally wear a large or extra large.  In this case, the band and the cups run small so I will have to order an XXLarge.  Otherwise seems to be made okay."
3.0,Not sure this will work and properly wrap around for anyone over 5'7/size 6.  Shortish length of sleeves seems to be the issue. Also appears to be quite basically put together. Arrived with one seam already fraying.  Keeping it anyway. Hope it holds up.
3.0,These socks are very thin. I am unsure why anyone would say they are anything other then that!!! My shoe size is 8.5 and I had a hard time fitting the sock on. $9 for a pair of socks that are thin is crazy ~~~ so I returned them!
3.0,Cheap  material and is kinda small but love the style
3.0,"My daughter loves the watch, but the glass watch face fell off.  The watch still works, but I could be dangerous for her to wear."
3.0,Could see glue around some of the stones. 2 of the stones fell out in a couple of weeks. A little dissapointed.
3.0,Wouldn't automatically adjust for edt even when I tried manual signal reception I had to manually reset the time. Band was too short I had to order a longer one.
3.0,It fits well price was good and it repelles water good
3.0,I always wear a woman’s 9 in Nike’s but these are bigger than usual. The right one almost slips off my foot a bit.  They are really light and not as sturdy as what I was looking for but over all not bad.
3.0,"I am 5’8”, 130lb, and wear a 34B. I purchased a small and the length is perfect. However, the dress on the model shows the top extending to about the waist.  The top portion of my dress only reaches is very short and the skirt begins a couple 2-3” above my waist. It’s comfortable for around the house but I won’t be wearing it out anywhere."
3.0,I purchased the key chain like my current one that I can separate the rings and keys.  It doesn't but look sturdy.
3.0,Very comfortable! Soon as you wash them don’t heat dry. They shrink!
3.0,Really pretty BUT after washing they stretch too much
3.0,Fabric is great - design is great. Ordered wrong size. Go up about 2sizes is my opinion
3.0,Took over a month to receive the necklace but my daughter loves it
3.0,Purchased it for wearing to a festival. It served its purpose for one weekend then started tearing and the sequins began falling off. Price is worth the one weekend use.
3.0,"Not quite water resistant as most watches, pretty sliiiiiiick tho"
3.0,"I want to love this, but didn't really find anything to do with it once I got it. I like the idea better than the item, probably because it seems like a lot of work to figure out what to put on it."
3.0,"Me gustaron, pero en la primera vez que las uso mi pequeña se despintaron un poco de las rodillas, no me parece que sean para el uso rudo que le dan los peques :) pero si están muy lindas"
3.0,Great cotton but a bite thick
3.0,Stitching is already coming out after one wear
3.0,Heavier then I thought it would be.  Not the best for summer.
3.0,Ordered these water shoes for my daughter. Fit is great but we’ve used them twice in a week and the toe on one is already unstitched. I’ll have to hand stitch these.
3.0,"These leggings have a nice, soft feel, but there's a strange sheen to them that is not very attractive when you put them on. I can't explain it but I don't love how they fit or look which is a pity because the quality seems great and the pockets are a plus, as is the high rise aspect."
3.0,I love the print..But when it arrived it was broke and kind of cheaply made..<br />  They refunded me immediately and because of that I would give them another chance and buy again..
3.0,I'm 5ft 7.. slim build.. love the shirt but the sleeves are short on me so I cant use the thumb holes.  Which was disappointing seeing that I dont like the tops of my hands exposed to the sun
3.0,Nice pants but I'm very small so they are a tiny bit to big. But be careful because if you are to large for these they will show a Lot. One other problem i had was they came all the way up to my navel but then agen I'm only 5' 2&#34; so I'm probably just a little to small for them.
3.0,I was disappointed by how short this is. Picture was deceiving.
3.0,"The watch band itself is great, and can be used with any properly sized Apple Watch depending on which you get. But the case doesn’t work for the series 4 like they claim. The speaker cut outs on the one side are misaligned as they were meant for the series 3 and below. The hole for the crown is also slightly misaligned, making it so the crown is very difficult to turn. So yeah, if you’re cool with getting it just for the bands I’d recommend it, just not the actual case if you have an S4."
3.0,"These legging are well made and the fabric has a nice smooth feel. Unfortunately, they run very small! I typically wear a small or extra small in compression/athletic leggings. These legging were so tight they were unflattering and uncomfortable. If considering purchasing, I would suggest sizing up!"
3.0,I liked it until it broke after a few months of use.  😒
3.0,"I order US XL and it fits, pockets are very small, zipper toggle on left side, zipper seems cheap and fragile"
3.0,"I purchased these as the pictures etc indicate the wrist would sinch to your wrist, this is not the case. Hopefully if we need to use them it'll be good enough."
3.0,"The material for this dress is great & when I tried it on it fit. When it arrived it did already have stains (like marker marks or something) but I over looked that because I wash items before I wear them out anyway. When I actually went to wear the item, i found out that my bra kept showing. It can be worn with fashion tape but If you have plans for after, fashion tape is not what you want around your boob area if you know what I mean. Anyway, not sure if I will return it yet. I' 5'6&#34; 140lbs & wear a 32D. I bought a M. No, I don't need a large lol it would have been way too big as the medium was already baggy in spots."
3.0,Quality seemed ok but it was smaller and shorter than expected.  I returned it.
3.0,I originally got a small but it was to small in the bust area and I like more baggy fit anyway. I am a 32B and the medium was better but also a little small in the bust. Still a good fit if you have a smaller chest. Love that the arms are not huge like a unisex t-shirt!
3.0,The pants started to pill and loose their softness after a few washes.
3.0,"I love it but it falls apart easily in the wash, especially at the armpit. Otherwise very pretty and comfortable."
3.0,Very pretty necklace however I have to return it because it does not fit around my neck like a choker should.  Should be a little smaller.
3.0,Loses color after a couple months. ..
3.0,Eh returning also to big
3.0,"This isn't a terrible jacket. The leather seems to be decent quality for the price, and it came well-packaged and on time. I'll be returning it, though, for a few reasons:<br /><br />1. My shoulders are actually a little wider than my hips, but this jacket was big for my shoulders, and also too small around my hips.* This might be perfect for some people, but it just doesn't look or feel right for me. Unfortunately, I've never had a problem with clothes being too small for my hips, because I don't have much to speak of in that area.<br /><br />2. The lining feels kinda weird, like the lining of a cheap purse or something. Not really sure what's going on there.<br /><br />3. It smells funny, not like leather, but like something synthetic.<br /><br />*  For reference, I'm about 5' 6&#34;, 150 lbs, 42&#34; shoulders, 40.25&#34; bust, 33.5&#34; waist, 40.5&#34; hips. I ordered an XL."
3.0,"I ordered the appropriate size according to the size chary and after reading many reviews. I am 5'1"" and 122lbs. I ordered a small. Big mistake!! I should have ordered a large. It's cute but with the sizing so off I'm just sending back!! I don't have time to mess around with it!! Up till now I've had great success with ordering clothing on Amazon."
3.0,A little better
3.0,"I got this for a Halloween costume. It worked fine for that so I have worn it a few times since, it already looks pretty beat up. The leather is cheap and is starting to separate like cardboard."
3.0,"While this hat does provide amazing sun coverage, it has a total bucket shape which is a very unattractive look on me. If you like bucket hats, this is your hat. Otherwise, I do not recommend. The hat does not have a wide brim look as pictured."
3.0,"Hate the elastic in the hem, which doesn't really show in the pic. Not nice fabric. cheap."
3.0,I dont like tube socks and this fitting feels like that. I  was looking for a thinner wool blend sock and. I guess. I got it. Not soft or comfortable.
3.0,You can't unscrew the ball
3.0,"Not sure on this case size & depth decent.  However, the smell is awful it has a weird chemical. If the smell doesn’t leave within a few days will return. It’s nuce looking but wow the odor whew!!!!"
3.0,"I have broad shoulders, so it is tight around the armpits."
3.0,If you wear a M with bust 36-38 try selecting a XL to get room space
3.0,It comes with a good piece of leather with some kind of pink paint.  I stained mine dark a nd it fits great and looks better.
3.0,It's cute and the glow in dark feature exciting to a young recipient.  What we did NOT realize when we purchased is that you cannot open the locket with it on the chain.  A significant flaw for a locket in our opinion.  It was inexpensive so I should have realized there must be a reason--that was it.
3.0,I returned it because of the color the bag its ok
3.0,"The loops to tighten this up both of them came loose ,with that being the case was not able to tighten them on my to make it secure."
3.0,"Just not as substantial as I had imagined.  Yes, flat and low profile.  Not a lot of elasticity to it."
3.0,Fit kind of weird
3.0,Nice. Came very wrinkled with 2 buttons off.  Made ok.  Belt is simplistic with no magnitude. Wouldn't purchase more from this maker
3.0,"These are very soft and EXTREMELY stretchy under pants. I have a case of WGB (white girl butt). Which seems to be a problem for this brand. They are a bit loose and will slide down some through out the day. now, if you have been blessed with an backside then these just might be the pair for you. if you need some stretch these will not let you down. They stretch for miles."
3.0,Awkward fit - had to return.
3.0,Love the shirt but ordered a large which I usually fit with everything else i wear but this was too small
3.0,Sized larger then discribed
3.0,"This shirt is super cute. I ordered it in large, and LOVED it right when I got it. I would have given in 5 stars if I had reviewed it right after purchase.<br /><br />My issues:<br /><br />The shoulders stretched out. How this happened? I have no idea. I thought clothes shrank slightly in the wash? It's like it went through the wash a couple times, and suddenly it was too big. I did loose a little weight, but not enough that the shirt should be falling off my shoulders. I'm really annoyed that it's so big on me now that it's practically unwearable. I do love the waist, it's nice and snug, totally flattering.<br /><br />I'm also pregnant, and at first (before the shoulders got all loose) it hid my little baby bump pudge, while still being very comfortable.<br /><br />Oh, also, the little crystal was ugly. I peeled it off and it didn't leave a mark. I wanted this shirt in other colors, but now I won't be ordering any more of them. I would need a M in the shoulders and neck and a L in the hips, and it just doesn't exist. Maybe after I have my baby I'll attempt to order a M and see how it goes, because it is a cheap, cute shirt."
3.0,"The watch face is really nice, the band seems a little cheap but then the overall price of the watch was not that expensive. It Is also an adult band not a child band. Will probably replace the band If I can."
3.0,They are so amazingly cute that I hate to give it a three star review. Maybe it is my fault but I got them for my crawler/new to walking. After 30 minutes outside the toes are shredded.
3.0,These were too small for my son so I had to return them. He also found them rather stiff.
3.0,Missing the protective sleeve and came scratched.
3.0,"shoe string on right shoe is about to break already, only had shoes on 2 days so far."
3.0,"We received our order very fast, but the pajamas ran very large"
3.0,I liked that it matched my ring and necklace. But they were smaller than expected. I would have liked to be able to see a photo of the earrings on a life size ear so I can see their true size
3.0,"The ring is beautiful and I love that shape. In fact, I spent more for this thinner version than my previous one just because it looks more elegant! The reason for not giving 5-stars is because the first time I went swimming it got dark from the chlorine, while my other silver (ring, necklace and earrings) did not. I did fix it with vinegar and baking soda but it still does not look exactly like before and now I have to take it off every time."
3.0,runs a little large
3.0,"The material is thick, I thought it was soft. The top is very cute, but too large. I normally buy a size M and ordered the largest size because of the reviews but I should of stick to size L"
3.0,"It is advertised as a clip, but it is for pierced ears only."
3.0,These shoes are nice and all but boy are they slippery when wet. especially on tile or any laminated surface. Almost took a serious fall few times!
3.0,El artículo queda muy pequeño no tiene el ajuste adecuado a la talla
3.0,This item looked very cheap
3.0,"This is my second ring purchase. I liked my first one so much I ordered two more as gifts.<br />Sadly one of the rings arrived without the stone attached. The stone is also different in these rings. There is no foil backing like my first ring, and the stones are bluer. My first ring has a more aqua tone (lower ring on finger), very close to aquamarine. These two are more the color of blue topaz. I wish there was a way to contact the seller. I want to re-order but I would prefer the foil backed aqua looking stones. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,I like this because I like the design of it but it is very cheap but it cuteness makes up for it
3.0,Not flattering on curvy figures - order a size up
3.0,Very tiny size all the way around. Love the small lenses but the frame is super tiny and tight.
3.0,Ordered XS and it was still to big. Not for petite women.
3.0,It's a cute ring but I really would have liked the black part to not be so thick. The thickness makes it look more like a men's ring.
3.0,"Very cheaply made, looks and feels like painted cardboard with a strap and a shoe lace. Also made for a thin person."
3.0,Hard to complain when it is $5. The chain was dog tag/light pull chain style and the ring the chain went through to attach it to the pendant turned the pendant sideways (just remove it and put chain through pendant hole and it's OK.)
3.0,Dress is the perfect color and the material was okay. But im 5'10 and plus size i wear size 18 bottoms and 14/16 tops and im 40D bra. This dress was wayyyyyyyyyyy to short for my liking. It was above my mid thigh if I lean my booty shows. Have to wear strapless bra or cups since the arm holes go about mid breast. Will be a cute winter dress to wear with leggings or summer dress with thick tights if you dont mind your undies being visable.
3.0,"The pattern is cute. The material is super shiny and I was not expecting that. I love when sweatshirts have thumb holes which is partly why I bought this but the arms a little short and it hurts to wear the thumbs in the thumb holes. I am a little taller than average at 5’6” and my swing span is a little over average as well. If you’re shorter or have shorter arms, this might be great for for your ugly Christmas sweatshirt."
3.0,Doesn't fit like I think it should forbeing supple material.
3.0,"So cute and super thin material perfect for summer, but I am a size 1 and about 5'3&#34; and ordered a small, it was extremely short on me so it will be worn over a swimsuit but still adorable!"
3.0,"I thought I was ordering a black necklace.  What I got is navy blue.  The clasp is a barrel type but is so tiny, maybe 1/8 inch or less and was impossible for me to fasten.  I have arthritis in my fingers..  I had to redneck engineer a larger fastener by using rings in the existing clasp and adding a larger magnetic barrel clasp.  It is pretty and I will wear it but it was not quite as pictured."
3.0,"I love the color and the style of this shirt. I took of 2 stars bc it does not look like the picture. It has a slit on the bottom front of the shirt which is so odd. It looks cute tucked in, but the slit goes up a little too high so it still shows when it's tucked in."
3.0,"These glasses are okay. I'm not sure if they're actually polarized. If they are, the quality is nothing like I'm used to.<br /><br />Paid next to nothing for them so not worth returning. Will keep as a back up pair in my glove compartment."
3.0,"I loved how this looked in pictures, but unfortunately I think I'm just the wrong body type. I'm 5' 11&#34; and I bought a size up to make sure I had the length in the torso and arms, but sadly it just made the jacket huge around my stomach and still slightly small for the length of my torso. I wear this in the fall unzipped sometimes just so I don't feel like I wasted my money, but regret trying. All I want is a brown leather jacket that fits my tall frame:("
3.0,"I did in fact, measure my 15 month old's foot and used the sizing guide when I put in my order. But sadly when they arrived he wasn't having it! I put them on, and he immediately seemed uncomfortable. I pinched the toes to check when his foot was, and they were right up in the seams of the boot (granted, my toddler has big feet for his age) If you've got a baby that is on the bigger side, order a size up FOR SURE. They are cute though. The fur lining did seem like it was falling out/sticking too his feet a bit too. Bummer. Hopefully I get around to sending them back soon..... :\"
3.0,"Scared my 2 year old great grandson, made my wife cuss me, didn't scare her I guess."
3.0,Cute but returned it because there isn't any structure to it.
3.0,"I own several freshwater pearl pieces.  And I'm used to the fact that most freshwater pearls do have a unique shape to them and that they won't be perfectly round.  However, these were extreme.  The earrings didn't come close to being similar at all."
3.0,"This dress is not made for tall people. Very cute and great fit overall, but I won't be able to sit down. I'm 6 ft tall and all sizes had the same length. Unsure if I want to pair it will leggings yet or just not sit."
3.0,Esta rayando
3.0,Small and compact but very flimsy. Always turns inside out.
3.0,"This is a darling bag. It looks better than pictured. It's a perfect size for me - not too small, not too large. The two pocket inside are not helpful for many of today's larger phones, but imagine something will fit in there, such as a folding brush or a small container of lotion. The zip pocket is a good size. Mostly, though, it's just one open section. Given the size, that is all I'd expect.<br /><br />There are two things to note about it if you are going to purchase it. First, when I opened the box, there was a strong outgassing smell. It doesn't appear to be real leather, rather some type of poly vinyl leather-ette. It's been sitting out for two weeks and now still smells some. While it's getting harder to get real leather at this price, the description is incorrect, I believe, and should not say it is leather. The second is that the watermelon color has more coral in it than I expected. I know colors on the monitor are not always accurate - if it looks more  dark pink-red/cherry on your monitor, know that it's a bit lighter and has more of a peachy/coral undertone than a blue/red undertone."
3.0,Very nice but broke easily
3.0,I like this shirt and it fit as expected. The only negative was that the stitching on the sides for the loops that the fabric string weaves  through wasn't sewn to be all that durable. I had to go in and add some extra stitching in order to keep it from becoming too loose when I would tie up the sides when wearing the shirt. Otherwise is a very stylish shirt!
3.0,Fun design not for petite figure<br /> Fabric slightly stiff but may be good for not being too clingy and showing what you don't want to show
3.0,Don't like it because it's loud. I did not spend all this money on a watch for a band to make me not want to wear it
3.0,Wore it once get fit! However after washing it the material got harder & fuzzy.
3.0,I was bummed. I went by the size chart and it fits smaller than expected.
3.0,The green tank is actually more yellow and I wanted it to be green like the picture!
3.0,"I love the style of the logo, but the clip chain easily broke, I’m going to buy a separate chain to replace it.<br />(Chain link broke within a week of wearing)"
3.0,"This runs smaller than the size guide indicates, by at least one size, maybe two.  The material is also very thin, like felt."
3.0,The pen holding  the side together  started  to come out but I was able  to put  it back in.hope it stays.otherwise  I like very much
3.0,"The finish of the plastic gets flaky and the arms get lose easily, but they are comfortable and the polarization is good"
3.0,I like the hat...just wish the hat was a bit smaller
3.0,"The product works as described, and is a nice belt.  The only reason I did not give it a higher rating is that the buckle mechanism is heavy compared to the rest of the belt, making it inconvenient to hook through the loops of a pair of pants."
3.0,The color wasn’t right. The item I received was picked (like it had been worn and pulled by a safety pin). Package was cut.
3.0,"My kindergartner gave these to his peers as a Christmas gift. I had read previous reviews and was prepared to trim the nails (which I did have to do). He was thrilled to give them away, they are very pretty. The reason I am not giving a full 5 stars is because several of the “toes” fell off in my hand as of they were disintegrating. This happened with maybe 3 out of 20 of the feet."
3.0,"Wayyy to big! And im an adult, although with a slim face. So definitely would recommend to someone who has a more rounder, fuller face or something. But, it does look like the picture! Super cute just disappointed in the fitting for me."
3.0,"Love the shirt...lots of compliments...XL is usually a lose size for me, however this XL is snug."
3.0,Cute but a few of my butterflies fell off within first week
3.0,"They are pretty...HOWEVER...can see that the elastic thread that holds it all together will not hold up for any length of time.  There is an elastic thread that holds each link to the next one.  Also...had some weird declaration that metal was questionable (already wrapped the bracelet, so I can't check what it said)...made in China"
3.0,They are alright just not great. They just don't look or feel as if they will last very long.. they look and feel very cheaply made
3.0,Not shiny like depicted in the photo
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty, but smaller than I expected.  I wouldn't suggest buying from this vendor as it takes a VERY LONG TIME IN GETTING THEM.  It is not worth the wait."
3.0,"Got these for my 7 year old. Good looking pair of sunglasses, comfortable for him to wear but only lasted a week. One of the arms broke off of it while he was holding them. Very disappointed they didn’t last."
3.0,I am not sure who these can fit - I am a 125 lb woman and sleeves were way too wide however they were also too short from my wrist to bottom of short sleeves.  The fabric and print and quality is beautiful so I really wanted these to work
3.0,"It is cute but, if you don't have the exact ear shape it is hard to get it to look good.  I guess my ear wasn't exactly right so I tried to stretch it a bit and that didn't work.  Wished it had."
3.0,Little small for me..
3.0,"Cute, but a little loose on the leg hole area. Better worn with sweat pants as a &#34;tank&#34; style. But still cute if you wanna be a little &#34; cheeky&#34; if you know what I mean."
3.0,"I purchased the 2 pack with pink/silver. The pink ones are fantastic, super reflective and I love them. They are a tiny bit too big for my face but I'll wear them anyway. The silver was not what I had in mind based on the images I looked at, they aren't reflective/mirrored on the front at all. But still a good pair of sunnys."
3.0,Small in the cup size
3.0,"i love the size, the finish. the only thing is hat it's very hard to open & close. i hurt my nose & fingers trying to get it on & off."
3.0,Very colorful. Bend very easily
3.0,Washed it and it shrunk
3.0,Seems good but took a bit to get here
3.0,Not cut to size.  Get larger size.  Shrinkage after washing
3.0,I Wearing Glasses  isn’t comfortable it’s foggy !🤓👓👓
3.0,This jeans is not much stretchable so its uncomfortable. It is super skinny though. If the stretchiness does not bother you then its fine. This thickness is ok
3.0,Dress does not look like photo. The material is see through and not durable enough to keep the sleeves as pictured as a poof on the shoulders. Returned.
3.0,The view is false picture.  It goes up much higher the what is viewed in picture. Okay for date night.
3.0,Ordered larger size than normal but still came to small. Fabric is not the greatest quality.
3.0,Sent back cute
3.0,Should have known from china but looks great fits like expected way to small  but son loves his free cool shirts.
3.0,Love it! But this isn't the one I got
3.0,The fabric isn't what I expected plus it was too long. Picture looked better.
3.0,It looks great and can fit any wrist. They send whatever color they want.
3.0,"I like the cut and color, it's exactly as pictured but not very flattering from the side. Also, SEE THROUGH material. Make sure you definitely wear a bra but even then your bra is also going to show."
3.0,"I got a similar dress to this one from another company and thought it would be the same.... its not, though it was the same size.  It was tight everywhere it shouldn't be, and ran quite small to size.  Disappointed."
3.0,Sent back.  It's more of a maroon and not true red.
3.0,i like how it looks!!!
3.0,Smaller than what was suggested
3.0,Ok so the dress looks nothing like the picture but is MUCH CUTER . The Aline front cut is great for this hot summer days as I assume most people will wear this dress as a coverup for pools & beaches . The back is longer to cover the rear and the side slits show just the right amount of leg & allow for movement .
3.0,Doesn't look the same as the picture
3.0,Cute for the price but doubt it will last beyond too many &#34;princess events &#34;. Better to spend money and buy the style they offer at Disney store when available - and for store price not highly inflated rates.
3.0,"I got two shirts, same size and color but different materials and styles. One I like, one is too formal/loose, more flimsy. I don’t really  understand why I got two different shirts , so I’m just giving three stars."
3.0,"I like these for my niece that’s just shy of 5, but my 3 year old niece struggled. These are impossible for small children to adjust themselves, so I was constantly helping the girls readjust them. They loosed a lot when the girls would pull them off to look at something etc. I’m going to put them away until they are older. It’s not worth the struggle now. Kids yes. Toddlers no. Keep looking."
3.0,Sizing inaccurate
3.0,"I ordered mine through a site on Facebook. Got the bracelets today, ordered two of them. Their tricky to open and they won't fit a adult medium wrist. They are pretty, but poorly made."
3.0,Cheaply made or should I say fragile. Did not last. I was disappointed for the price.
3.0,"I got this and tried it on.  It is very short.  I am 5’2” and this cardigan barely came to the top of my pants, which were mid-rise!  On the other side of things, it is very soft."
3.0,"Great fit but colors weren't nearly as vibrant as the picture.  Sadly, I returned it"
3.0,"I love the idea of this sweatshirt! I am a bigger girl, & wish the sides were a little longer. But it is a very baggy sweatshirt. So if I order down, it would be shorter"
3.0,These are very tight. definitely should be an undershirt.
3.0,It smells so fishy!! I hung it up outside in the sun for 2 days and the odor dissipated.
3.0,"My daughter is 4 years old and is very tall for her age wearing a 5T in most things, So I order a  6t to be on the safe side, and the shirt is nice and looks exactly like the picture and so does the pants but the sleeves on the shirt seems a little short definitely not 6T and the pants is more like a 4T smh  and outfit is very thin. I most likely would not be purchasing again after the last two outfits I brought and received the wrong size. Might as well get at least one wear out of it before I give  it away to someone with a 3yr old."
3.0,I liked them but they kept falling out. I've had my nose pierced for 10+  yrs
3.0,Very cute but... not really my style when I tried it on...
3.0,"The scarves are fine, seem to be well-made, nice and long and soft. But, the randomized color is annoying. I ended up with two of the same color. It’s one thing to get 6 different colors at random; but two of the same color feels like a waste of money. Who’s picking the colors? A machine? Why would they put two of the same color? Anyway, they are fine scarves for the price. I’ll give the extra away."
3.0,For $1.99 it was cute and just right for my granddaughter who is only 9.
3.0,"I have other Bobster (Ambush) googles [[ASIN:B002T8IOA4 Bobster Ambush Convertible, Mat Blk Frame, Amber Lens ANSI Z87, BAMBU101A]] which fit well and I really like. The Sport and Street though has a wide fit that left a wide gap between the arms and the temples of my medium size head. It was not a comfortable fit with helmets that covered my ears. If you use the straps instead of the arms or maybe a half helmet then these may be ok with a helmet. The interchangeable lense is also a nuisance. For about the same price I was able to get two fixed lense googles and so no time consuming lense changes needed. My total wear time with the S & S model was probably 15 minutes then I gave them away."
3.0,"they are nice overall, but they a a bit too snug  on the sides of my head, they seem rather flimsy and  they were not packaged in a bod , just in a cloth pouch in an envelope were cracked when i got them"
3.0,"I ordered a 2XL and can fit some XL. This shirt fit like a tight XL and I can’t even button it. This was disappointing as the shirt does look nice overall. Also, while it says “Deep Green” in the description, it definitely looks blue."
3.0,Runs a little small/tight
3.0,"While this socks will categorically not feet me (could not resist the pun). I wear a size 10.5 M US in shoes, they fit my wife's (Size 6.5 W US) feet reasonably well. The grip is however somewhat unsubstantial for maintaining a proper yoga pose. So: Small feet/not on carpet yoga, you could buy it. Larger feet, do not buy."
3.0,"Nice looking well constructed unesex socks.<br /><br />Unfortunately they don't seem to fit anyone in the house. My wife wears a size 8 shoe and she can barely get them on her feet, by the time she does they are stretched out paper thin and way to tight to wear. I wear a size 11, I knew the moment I saw them that they weren't going to fit so I didn't even bother trying LOL<br /><br /> It's not that we ordered the wrong size, There was no shoe sizes listed on the packaging or the web page, all it said was Min-Womens socks and nothing to indicate size so I just figured it was a one size fits all deal.<br /><br />All I can say is if these were intended for adults then they were intended for petite adults or more likely teens."
3.0,"This is exactly what I wanted BUT it us two sizes too small. I ordered a large or size 12, my son currently wears a size 8. His dad has a large jean shirt he uses to layer over lighter shirts to wear on chilly days in our workshop. My son wanted to be lije daddy. This arrives, and it fits, but I expected it to be HUGE on my son...I planned on him being able to wear this a few years.....I am guessing by next year it will be too small for him to wear. Dissappointed."
3.0,This is the second one I have ordered with this design but from a different manufacturer . It has a catch in it just like the other when opening. I will not be sending it back as I didn't want to wait a second time  for a replacement. Note ! Not all Inverted umbrellas are made the same
3.0,Cheaper looking then expected
3.0,Fabric VERY thin
3.0,Color and texture are excellent...fits small even though I ordered a size up already
3.0,"The dress fit well. 5’6, 145lbs I usually wear a small. XS fit like a glove. The length was perfect, longer in the back. But the material feels cheap so had to give only three stars.<br />Update: the white fabric from the layer underneath keeps showing up on the neckline. Not happy!"
3.0,"When I rec’d the hole for the front button was sewn shut. Wasn’t able to wear until I bought a seam ripper, I hope it doesn’t affect the stitching."
3.0,I used this product for my diaper bag. It fits good on my shoulders the only thing is that sometimes it slides down. I have to continue adjusting the strap every now and then.
3.0,"I normally wear size Large in blouses.  Since this turtleneck was form fitting, I ordered XL.  It is WAY too tight.  The XL size fits like a Medium!  The quality is good, but the sizing is way off."
3.0,"If you have full, long hair this may not be the best choice for you. I have both and I find it very annoying to put on and take off. I wish it had a quick release but you have to put it over your head and even at the longest length, it’s a struggle and my glasses always creak from being over stretched. I’ll be giving the others away."
3.0,Was supposed to be a pack of 6 but only gave me 5 !!!
3.0,The size was way to small and the clasp is to danty it will break easily. Had to return it.
3.0,Color is perfect but material seems different than pictured. Sleeves are not quite the same but it's still cute
3.0,Pulls on arm hair
3.0,The top is very long. I don’t mind shirts being long to cover the bum but this one goes down to my knees. It’s like a dress. Maybe I’ll try with leggings. Not what I expected.
3.0,"I was expecting the gathered, elastic section to be below my boobies, but it is WAY higher - almost bisects where my breasts are on my body.  Also, the model is wearing a dress that hits at the ankle.  Mine hit just below my knee and I'm only 5' 4"" so it's not like I'm a giant of a woman.  I can wear it around the house, but I wouldn't even think of going to the store (even Walmart, considering the photos of what customers wear there) in this.  My first thought when I put it on was if I was Catholic, this would work as a sackcloth for lent."
3.0,They do about a good a job as you'd expect.
3.0,Add says black in color but I think it's more of a charcoal grayish. Mutch thinner than the one I got last time as well.
3.0,"This could be a great t-shirt, but we might suggest it be thoroughly edited for spelling before the next print run. 4 out of 6 words being vastly misspelled gave us a laugh. Would not *not* recommend, just read it closely when it arrives."
3.0,"GORGEOUS tiara . Heavy and  well made .  It broke while my hairdresser was adjusting it but you couldn't notice.  She could have been too heavy handed with it too. All in all , a good purchase."
3.0,It's very cute however it runs big. The elastic in the waist is not flattering to babies unless it's a bit more snug. My baby is 5 months so the smallest size was huge on her.
3.0,I like the design of the hat. But the embroidery of the logo is sub par in my opinion and the back closure was definitely not up to snuff. I returned this hat.
3.0,I bought the dress with the size chart and it was huge on me. I ordered a size 4. I should have ordered a 2 but went off the size chart.
3.0,Present to daughter and she wasn't a fan.
3.0,I had to return because I didn’t know was so tiny. I assume that will be regular kid size but it’s so tiny
3.0,The top is a good fit and quite comfortable to sleep in. The shorts are huge! I feel more like I'm wearing a skirt than shorts based on the amount of material.
3.0,"Right out of the box the leather zipper pull was broken. I searched for the grommet or piece that held it on but could not find it. The zipper is odd. As shown in photo, it is only sewn part way. I got this to travel so my concern is that someone can easily reach in since I wear cross body with the bag in back. I get that by not attaching it all the way it allows you to open the purse much wider, but the zipper starts 3-4inches into the bag. Three stars cause I love the look and comfort but deducted two for zipper and quality control."
3.0,Runs a little small but has hole in pocket.  For the price it is worth it.
3.0,"Pros: Super-lightweight, Comfortable, Low Heels, Great for walking, didn't need to break in even with my wide feet.<br /><br />Cons: Not that great-looking, makes feet look rather long; Construction appears cheap with the cork, but is actually rather sturdy; The strap is flimsy looking and gets in the way, not really necessary since the body of the shoe pretty much covers the majority of your feet; I got this in black and it's more of a grey in suede, always looks like it needs a polish."
3.0,Strap broke first couple days of wearing it
3.0,Heavy on earlobes.
3.0,"Its a good shirt, length is perfect and the top itself is very summery.<br />I read the reviews and ordered a size up, its too baggy. It is a baggy flowy top in itself, but because it is too big the arm holes are huge on me. I am going to wear in a few times anyway, instead of returning it.<br />For reference to order: I wear a small usually, 34B, 130lbs. Small or medium would be fine on me."
3.0,I really like the Gentle Grip top on the stocking. These were a lot thicker than the sox I normally wear.
3.0,I can't seem to get the top to sit like it is as shown in the picture. Looks great on the model. It's comfy and fits nice.
3.0,Slightly better than wearing a stocking.  Still restricts your vision.
3.0,Everything I've EVER bought by Charter Club has fit perfectly -  These swallow me.  Too much hassle to return.
3.0,"Not a bad pair of leggings, the pattern/design is as pictured and pretty cool, the fabric is ok, not super smooth and soft, but not horrible.  I believe it's more polyester and less cotton.  The fit was a tad weird for me as I am hippy so it fit a bit weird at the hips and rested at the lowest part of my hips which is fine when I'm standing but not so great if I squat or bend over.  The pattern gets a tad see thru the more it has to stretch, so be careful when under garmets you choose to wear underneath.  Overal it was slightly more snug though the thights and calf than I care for so I gave them to my daughter."
3.0,"I really enjoy the look of the item, however it does run small and short.  Instead of reaching the floor, this item is above my ankles and I'm on 5'5"
3.0,They are beautiful but you can see strings of hot glue but that's fixable.. and the ring is adjustable which is great.. I bought these for my senior prom I hope people love them
3.0,The grey one pulled apart/broke the first time I tried to put it on? The other 3 were fine and didn't break
3.0,"States it is for girls, boys, kids but sized for adults.  Too big for my 9 and 12 uear old."
3.0,"The belt looks great, but it has an elasticity to it that I would rather not have in a belt."
3.0,"I am not impressed with the quality of the boots.  They are hard to get on and not very comfortable.  The price seemed right when I choose these; however, you get what you pay for...."
3.0,"Theses are NOT touchscreen gloves, though they seem to be made well and are very thick"
3.0,Runs a bit big. Very underwhelmed. I returned.
3.0,Very tight in the bust area but then poofs out more than expected after that point.
3.0,"Really cute and well made. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is that it ran small, Very tight on my 7 year old granddaughter. It was a birthday gift. She was disappointed and I needed to make the arm bands bigger. She is actually small for her age. If you don't mind a little sewing it still works fine."
3.0,The dress is really cute but the way the top lays on the chest wasn't very flattering for me. When it was clasped shut there was a huge opening so the coverage wasn't that great.
3.0,but the quality after washing isn't great. May get the white one next - pilling was too noticeable on the black.
3.0,Hat arrived faster than expected. Overall good value for the money especially given no minimum order. The logo is definitely some sort of sticker pressed on. I’m not too optimistic it will last long. For a $6 though it’s  pretty much what you expect. Will probably spend more on better quality next time. Overall satisfied.
3.0,Like the fitting of the face mask.<br /><br />Did not appreciate the LACK of attention to detail of the finished product.  It appears that the product was sewed all the way around and when it got to the end they just kept going and didn't finish it well.  DO NOT CUT the hanging end of the face mask as it will come apart as seen in the left side of the picture attached.
3.0,I liked the feel of them but they are much too long in the front. Going to try hemming them so they don't hang down so far.
3.0,It's small on me even if I chose the size that fits me. The pads doesn't look good on me and it moves. So I took it out and wear it as a sleeping bra.
3.0,"I’m a 40C and I ordered a 40C. The size runs very small&uncomforatble on. However,it’s a great deal for quality& the bra’s material is very pretty and smooth. I would order 1-2 sizes bigger than original size."
3.0,This not  like it. I
3.0,Just too wide
3.0,Great price but they had some fringes along thread line
3.0,The side seams totally threw off the design continuity at the hemline. Fortunately I have a friend who is an amazing seamstress and she was able to remedy it otherwise I would have sent it straight back.
3.0,"Edges are very sharp, can get uncomfortable at times"
3.0,Soft and slightly stretchy. Fits as expected but the color is off. Trim is pictured as beige but looks more pink/peach in person.
3.0,"Loved the neon lime color, but unless you're thin like the model, you might want to try a different design. Not my style, much too huggy on my entire body, no fllow or flair. But this would be adorable on a thinner person!  I'm 5'3&#34; and 160, pear-shaped, and ordered the Large. (My Tinkerbell days are obviously behind me LOL)"
3.0,"It is very comfortable and the pant suspenders really help the pants from ""rolling"" under. Excellent material as well. Make dure you upsize by one (use the chart) After only wearing 3 times, the zipper gave out. It will cost more to replace the zipper than this is worth."
3.0,Not the most flattering on plus size women but it works and it is very cute
3.0,"The top and bottom didn’t really match in size. I ordered a medium for both and the top was a little smaller, but still fit good. The shorts fit my waist but we’re larger and flared towards the bottom which looked odd. Still a really cute outfit and nice to be able to wear the top with other pants combinations."
3.0,"Really fine pair , I really like them<br />They are quite tight although this is my usual size<br />I only used them once"
3.0,"Very nice, but small for me.  Most people will probably like the dainty classy look."
3.0,"These reading/bifocal/sunglasses are taking me a long time to get used too.  I have bifocal glasses, but there isn't the jarring change from regular to bifocal like these sunglasses have.  I tried using them at the pool the other day to read in the sunlight, and they helped with that, but it wasn't as easy as reading with my regular glasses.  I have reading sunglasses that I like a lot better than these.  They seem to be sturdy enough built, and some people really like them.  I just find the bifocal part a little too intense."
3.0,"They are not awful, but they are not as universal as I had anticipated.  They are a little too loose at both the top and bottom, and a bit unfinished looking on one end - looking a bit stretched out and as though the elastic were exhausted or non-existent.  They do work well enough if you are not wearing leggings or other close to skin clothing.  If you wore say, boot cut jeans or hiking type cargo pants, etc. The tighter the pant/jean/legging, the more they ted to slouch and slide downward. With a more &#34;bulky pant&#34; they tend to stay up without slouching."
3.0,A little too big for me and nose piece is uncomfortable. I can’t fully recommend.
3.0,"I am 5""11 and this dress was too short.  I have to wear shorts with it.  Not a true dress ."
3.0,too short and looked for two days for pass thru hole and still can't find it
3.0,Nice but definitely runs SMALL
3.0,"Not really for holding the girls securely, more decorative then anything."
3.0,"Purchased for my 8 year old son. They do run a little large at the waist but that is normal with most pants on my son. My son said the biggest con on these pants is that they give off a lot of static electricity. He wore these to school recently and said as he was walking around the material on the inside of the pants would stick to his thighs near his underwear and then give him an electric shock. He said the only way to stop it from happening would be if he reached down into his pants to pull the material away from his skin, or if he wore his pants a little lower down, however wearing them lower made them more baggier on him and ended up exposing his spiderman briefs, which was very embarrassing.<br /><br />After all of this he will keep the pants but they wont be his top choice to wear"
3.0,"The material is really nice, silky, & comfortable. The pattern image is low quality, but not horrible. There's low quality stitching, with large knots of thread hanging out. It's on the larger side, I don't mind but I probably would have sized down if I knew beforehand (but I've lost some weight so take that with a grain of salt). It fits my needs, so I'm not unhappy, but I wouldn't buy it again, nor would I have bought it if I had known this before I purchased it. You get what you pay for, but it does function well considering the price."
3.0,Nice kids glasses but runs pretty snug for older kids. They are too tight for my 6 year old.
3.0,Not a fan of the material and a tad smaller than expected.
3.0,"This outfit is super cute. My daughter will get several wears out of the sweater, but the pants are a lost cause. They shrunk as soon as we washed them. They come up her leg like capris now."
3.0,A little too thin for daylight if you know what I mean.
3.0,"I would love to give this hat a higher rating but it has a few technical issues. While the R2D2 Peruvian hat is rounded so that there are no noticeable seams which cause irregularities, this Vader hat has a rather noticeable seam which goes across one's head from ear to ear.<br /><br />A seam going from ear to ear causes the hat to fit strangely, causing Vader's face to look scrunched up. While the quality of material was excellent--would absolutely keep you warm on a cold day, wearing the hat looked ridiculous enough that I couldn't bring myself to wear it outside of my apartment.<br /><br />To summarize, this hat will keep you warm, but is much too strangely constructed to give you Vader's confidence."
3.0,The sliver chain was too small but I love the charm and it changes sizes
3.0,The balls are big but cute tho
3.0,"Super cute, but the castle stops midway round the thigh. It would be better of it went all the way around. Also, it fits well everywhere except my thighs. It looks so stretched and strained."
3.0,"I bought these for racing mountain bikes and they are very cheaply made. They are pretty uncomfortable on my face and they have a very strong plastic smell whenever I wear them. They work alright, but I wouldn’t buy these if you’re looking for a good pair"
3.0,"Color good, design great, ran just a bit small, be careful , no dryer"
3.0,Fits kind of weird....top is ok ok but from the waist down it becomes way bigger
3.0,"Cute sweater, preppy but a little stiff and smaller than expected. My daughter is size 6 and it is a not as &#34;oversized/bulky&#34; as the picture appears. Of course, you do get what you pay for."
3.0,There's not much fabric to this piece as advertised in the photo. In agreement with other reviewers that this is very small and therefore pricey
3.0,The seller delivered on time and the product  is excellent but does not have computer blue light blocking ability. They are just magnifiers. For the money it was a good deal but didn't appreciate that they are baited and grouped in when you search for blue light blocking glasses when searched on Amazon.
3.0,It’s a good fit but the design is strange. The breast cups have a dent from the design and the bra looks funny under a shirt.
3.0,"I like the skirt, though is was heavier than expected, fit a little looser than expected (will order a size smaller next time), and better for the winter than the summer.  Problem is, who wears white in winter?"
3.0,These are beautiful and I wish I could actually wear them bc I’m a huge Van Gough fan but they’re so low quality that after wearing them for an hour I had to take them out from getting an allergic reaction and my ears itched for 3 days afterwards. They started to tarnish almost immediately as well. If you’re someone who has sensitivity to metals or sensitive skin these will not work for you. Only reason I gave 3 stars is bc I love the design.
3.0,"Wrong shape sent - Image was a circular pendant (Shield), Was sent a rectangular pendant !!"
3.0,"The dress fits as I expected overall, but is slightly shorter than I'd like. The hem lands about 2 inches above my ankle. The bottom is very flowy, so the only sizing consideration you need to make is the top portion. I ordered the Large and typically wear a 8/10 dress size, 34C chest. The material is very soft cotton, light-weight but not too see through. My only complaint is the sewing. The patterned material was sewn very crooked where it meets the solid top. The pattern is also not matched up on the side seems. Honestly, the sides don't super bother me, its the waist where the solid and pattern meet. It looks absolutely ridiculous and not at all like the product photo. Definitely wanted to like this dress and give 5 stars, but I just can't get past the poor sewing. I may try to convert it into a maxi skirt instead."
3.0,"Easy, simple, cool & comfortable. However, the colors aren't even close to what I wanted. I got a good price on it, so I'll just keep it."
3.0,"I bought these because I hate belts. They do an okay job, but the snaps aren't the best quality. They've popped off several times as I stretched, bent over, etc. I'll be replacing them with a less-cheap set very soon."
3.0,"I really like the style and stability of this shoe.  I was so bummed that the 7 was too short.  I am a 7 in heels and a 7.5 in athletic type shoes so I thought for sure I would be fine in the 7.  I was so wrong!! My toes were hanging clear off the shoe bed.  I'm now debating on whether to get the 7.5 or the 8.  I fear the 8 might be too floppy.  I really like the shoe, however."
3.0,"I bought this and HDE Women's Light Weight Sheer Chevron Zig Zag Striped Infinity Scarf for hiking in the sun. I like the HDE better, it is like a chiffon material, lightweight.<br />You can see thru the Buff, so not heavy. There is probably very little UV protection in this, but the HDE I bought you can see thru too ( I asked the Buff company if there is any UV protection in the Infinity scarf Buff I bought & they said no).<br /><br />So given that the Buff & HDE are both see thru (what the dermatologist told me to look for, in a rough gauge of UV protection), I like the HDE one better because the circumference around of this, is twice as long as the Buff Infinity scarf. The Buff is a more absorbent material tho, if thats important to you.<br />Great seller! Avidmax the seller, shipped very fast, lightspeed!"
3.0,"Great fit, but the straps on one started to unravel after 2nd wear!"
3.0,"Delivered in a prompt manner ordered a small, too large for a 24 in waist."
3.0,"I am a 40 dd 5'4 , 185<br />The shirt is a little big I would have gotten the large . The quality is good . A warm material.<br />I ordered Xl"
3.0,"I like these and will probably wear them as part of my Halloween costume, but to be honest they are not really the greatest thing.  They had some stretched out holes in odd places right out of the package.  They do not go over your fingers individually, there's a hole for your thumb and pinkie and then the other three fingers come out of one hole.  Feels super awkward.  I have small hands and they still show more of my knuckle than in the photo."
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed in the weight of this robe. for the price, it is a good buy. I just wanted a heavier cozy one"
3.0,After stepping in many deep puddles during my volunteer work I noticed when I got home and took off the shoe covers my sneakers were wet but not drenched.
3.0,I had to have them hemed
3.0,"I went a size up and the bottoms are still too small.  5'7 140 lbs, A cup, size medium fits really tight in the bottoms and great at the top. There are some ink spots on it straight out of the packaging that mostly came out.  Pearls and stuff seem really delicate so hand washing only."
3.0,"I ordered these along with a hot pink pair. They are similar in shape & design, but these are larger. I will wear them, but I wish they were a tad smaller."
3.0,Top fit is awkward
3.0,Fits good looks better
3.0,"I give 3 stars for the material & quality however the sizing is WAY off. I wear a large in everything sometimes a medium, this romper wouldn't even go up my leg. Was really disappointed because it looked so cute & I really wanted it to fit."
3.0,"quality is ok, wore it once the got bored of it."
3.0,"This Ear Wrap is very cool! Unfortunately, my ear is too small so it doesn't fit. I will try to bend it to fit."
3.0,"They look fantastic, but they are in no way Mens up to 12. I gave them to my housemate whose feet are size 8 womens, and they fit like a glove. The seller should fix the description to more accurately represent the size of these socks. If you are a man who's feet are size 10 or over, DO NOT BUY. They will not fit."
3.0,"Although I ordered this bag because of the size, I was disappointed at just how small and constricted it was. I took this bag on a weekend trip to walk around in the city and it was a bad choice. I typically carry a compact lotion, lip balm, phone, wallet and keys with me. With this, I had to squish my hand in to the bag to get my things. While the durability was obviously really good, the size was a no for me."
3.0,Too small ever after following the size guide.
3.0,"When I ordered this I thought this would be a regular shirt, but It’s a workout shirt. It has thin material Perfect to work out in. It also has thumb holes but I would like the shirt to be a little bit longer."
3.0,Zipper stripped on the second use. It is a great looking bag though.
3.0,"Really cute, but strings break very easily"
3.0,Hoodie runs too small!  A very pretty hoodie but too small to wear!!
3.0,"Returning item. The outfit itself is SUPER cute, but it's HUGE. I purchased the 4-5 year old size. My daughter is a tall, normal weight 4 1/2 year old. The outfit is sized for an 8 year old. Ridiculously large."
3.0,"These were just awkwardly fitted, they weren't comfortable. Extra long, but the bra area was small for my chest size.  I ordered a medium, I am a 32dd, 135 at 5'6. These covered my butt completely. I was hoping they would sit about half way down my bottom, but no. I sent them back."
3.0,"The dress came withouth the belt. It shows on the picture where I ordered it that it has a belt, red and white. I was supposed to used this dress on november 4. Now its not worth it. Very dissapointed."
3.0,I bought these for my husband but they were too small and cut off the circulation on his finger. I tried to contact the seller to get a different size but I never received a reply so I returned the rings to Amazon.
3.0,"I love this dress and how simply it was. It fit perfectly except for the length. On the model, it’s above her knees, mine was just below my knees. For reference I am 5’5, 135lbs and 34D. Everything else was great but I had to return it because I didn’t like the length."
3.0,"Soft, fluffy, and warm. It is very comfy but I had to return it. Medium was much too large and the Small fit but the sleeves were way too short."
3.0,Nice a bit too dark
3.0,The belt is nice however too short!!!
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but ran way too big. I ordered for a special event & it is too late to return the medium for a small. Disappointed, but the quality of the fabric was good."
3.0,"I needed a change purse to keep coins in my purse.  It's a good size the leather is real, and it serves its purpose well.  However, I ordered what looked like hot pink, and what I got was nowhere near hot pink. Almost looks like red.  But its just a coin purse, so no big deal."
3.0,This necklace is pretty cute but doesn’t look very high quality. Not bad for the price but I would look elsewhere for something better
3.0,Good quality but front rubbed my front of my calf raw
3.0,Sleeve gave away from wrist up on first wear and it was not even tight. Great color though.
3.0,"Nothing significant about this belt. Looks chic in the pic but due to how it's shipped it's kinked and not as shiny. I'll still wear it, I just expected it to be better in person."
3.0,"I was pumped to try this on and the xlarge was too small. Mostly around the arm area. If you have even slightly clubby arms like me, it hugs too tight and makes them look worse! So sad I have to return it."
3.0,"These were super comfortable. That's right, past tense. According to Amazon I purchased these on August 20, 2021. It's now June 1, 2022 and the left one broke. They also had the whole autumn and winter in my closet, so I would say they last about 1 warm summer season, if that. Also, I never wore them outside. They were my indoor shoes for warm weather. So they were comfortable but I probably won't buy again."
3.0,The suitcase itself is really nice and good quality. We bought it to use as a carry on. The issue is it states that it's 24&quot; but the wheels sit up so high it adds an extra 3&quot; and makes it 27&quot; which is not approved for most airlines carry on sizes.
3.0,Not one size American.
3.0,Bought this for Halloween day time clothes. The fabric is weirdly stretchy. Fits normal.
3.0,"These are nice, but my &#34;assortment&#34; of 5 came with 3 animal print and 2 striped so I wouldn't really call that assorted. There were no animal prints shown in the listing photos. Not expensive enough to be worth the hassle of returning. I'm sure I can find some one who will love the animal print ones."
3.0,I wanted something light weight to wear while cycling to keep the dust and bugs on while mountain biking and keep rain out of my mouth when commuting to work.  This does the trick.  It is a bit small for an average sized adult male head.  It was a low cost purchase that will service my occasional use.
3.0,"Was a super cute/cool costume, but just did not stay inflated well"
3.0,Wish it came in larger size because it's soo nice and soft. So pretty. I'm 2- 3x and this is more like a 1x
3.0,The bees are nice but 2 arrived broken at the pin so I could only wear 3
3.0,I expect that the dress be like the photo. And please... The long of the dress not to short .. 20 cm before the knee. Thanks.
3.0,Love the bracelet but you need to work on the lack her that fixed and I will buy one of every color
3.0,The moon bracelet broke the first time I wore it-<br />Should be attached to the other bracelet-<br />Much too delicate
3.0,These are not sweatshirts as described more like long sleeve shirts
3.0,"Its a lot more material than I need. Thank goodness I am only 5'3"". If my legs were longer than 30"" they would be too short!!"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:90ab43b9e287d87f1a9201a929ddc39f]] I love the concept of being able to light up my way basically, however one glove looked & was damaged. Texture of glove feels good, seam aren’t that good. Sure to unravel with continuous wear. I would recommend for night use; light is very bright."
3.0,The coat was cute and fit well.  The only problem is one of the side seams ripped not long after purchase.  luckily I have a sewing machine and was able to sew it closed.
3.0,Had to return and get a larger size
3.0,"I’m giving these 3 stars because the back triangle part doesn’t really show that much when they are on my ears.  The cute part (the back triangle) is 1/2 covered up by my earlobe.  A little disappointed.  Otherwise, quality and design are good.  Just wish they were a bit larger so you could see them better when on my ear"
3.0,"It looks great, but I would have thought it would be a bit bigger.  Its smaller than a dime.  Still, wife wants to keep it."
3.0,"Ordered it as a Christmas present. It was beautiful, arrived in time, she loved it, until she went to put it on and I guess tugged too hard🤷🏻‍♀️ The chain snapped and we couldn’t get it on another chain. Now she just keeps it with her other crystals."
3.0,"I thought that this dress was identical to another with a keyhole detail above the bust that I bought and loved.  But this dress in the same size (small) was way too long and too wide and in the waist, so I returned it."
3.0,"I really liked the style of this dress but the fit is much smaller than the size. If you buy this, buy a size up."
3.0,"i really love the design on these leggings, but be aware these are very much compression pants. i’m a plus sized girl and i got the XXL and they are pretty snug at the waist otherwise perfect!"
3.0,It's a really cute bracelet but the second time it was worn it broke!
3.0,"Bras were comfortable and fit nice and snug.  I ordered the XXL size so the bra fit was good.  However, one thing I did not like was the padding kept coming out of the bra in the washing machine. I have a front loader machine which is not rough on clothes yet these pads kept coming out each time.  In addition to that, the ""silky"" material ""glued"" onto the pads came off.  And for those two reasons I gave only a three star rating."
3.0,"The boots look really cute and my grand daughter loves them! With that said, I am disappointed in the quality of these boots. The zippers were hard to move and I had to put a little bit of cooking oil on them with a Q-tip to make them work. The 'leatherette' does not look like leather, it has a dull finish, which would have been OK if it was strong material. However, after wearing them to school for one day, the fronts of the boots are all scraped off and the layer of  'leatherette'  has scraped off. There is no way to use scratch cover or polish on this material, so they already look old after wearing them for one day. I really was hoping the quality would be better for these boots."
3.0,The gloves were snaller than expected not as good quality as expected
3.0,"The garment is well made, and looks very nice.<br /><br />But, it runs very large in my opinion.  I wear a medium in almost every shirt/top type out there, I ordered a medium, and it fits more like a large.  Other than that, it is noticeably heavier than a typical linen shirt, and this is likely because of the blend of 70% Rayon / 30% Linen.  It is also much less airy than a typical linen shirt due to this blend.<br /><br />Size down, and you will likely be happier."
3.0,Not as comfortable as I would like and the tongue under the laces gets all buched up when putting them on.  Otherwise they are really cute if nothing else.
3.0,"It's not good quality. I just wear it twice , the Link line are loose"
3.0,"The customer reviews stated that the dress was too small of a fit and to size up 2 dress sizes. I would not follow that advice because I normally wear a medium and I bought a large. As you can see from the picture, it is huge! Looks like a grandma's night dress. Maybe if I got a medium, it would hug my curves and look cute but it doesn't in an xl. I am a 35/36 bust. 28 1/2 waist and 41 hips. I normally an medium in clothes. The material felt kind of like a slick hospital night gown but maybe in the right size and on the body it would look good. I am returning. Order off the size chart and in your normal size."
3.0,I didn’t like the pant had to return it.
3.0,They are so loose fitting. I had to actually sew  mine and make it tighter to fit my arm
3.0,These are pretty but to long. I don’t see how it fits along the bottom of your ear. Plus each earring is specific to the right or left ear. You cannot switch them. And use them on the other ear.
3.0,Didn’t fit me. The small was too big in the waist and hips but also a little short. I would have tried the extra small but I was concerned they’d be even shorter. The material felt nice. I think would have liked the pants if they came in extra small extra long.
3.0,"Pants were okay, but I normally wear a small or medium and I was swimming in both the small and medium. Plus they were very long. When I tried to return, the small was not eligible but the medium was eligible for return. This made no sense. Why would anybody oder online if they knew they couldn’t return the item?"
3.0,very cute and spacious but recently the piece holding the beads to the zipper tore..
3.0,"It might be because they are sexy, but still. Rough doings need clothes that understand them."
3.0,Pros: Great design for pockets etc. Loved it for frequent travel - lots of space and compacts to fit in overhead.<br />Cons: bottom pocket got holes due to no padding - when sitting upright. Wheels are noisy. Handle not strong enough - mine bent after being hit by trunk lid.<br />Great idea but needs better construction.
3.0,"I LOVE this dress, but I bought it in white and it is pretty see through.  I'm planning on wearing in Key West - casual, so it works.  But if you are buying it in white to wear to a more formal occasion, I recommend using a slip. The length for me is perfect - I'm 5/1&#34;, 115lbs, bought it in small."
3.0,It looks like the picture so not disappointed.  I'll save it for a little gift for one of my nieces.  I didn't expect much!
3.0,It needs to be little larger. I kept it though. Soft leather.
3.0,Wear S/M.<br />Nice but too small even the M size .
3.0,"I bought two sets. The pink, green, aqua set is smaller than the blue, grey, purple set. The pink, green, aqua set is pretty snug and kinda makes my toenails hurt. The blue, grey, purple set is so big they have excess fabric in the heel and ankle area when I put my feet into shoes. Pretty disappointing."
3.0,"First band that is not immediately breaking out my skin. Will see how long it lasts<br /><br />Few months later, the band does not break out my wrist, only band that has worked, the circle from the actual watch still breaks me out though. But much better."
3.0,Nice looking dress but it broke first time I wore it. As everyone said the zipper is quite fussy and well....(see pic)
3.0,Okay pull over. Pretty thin. It’s cute so no big deal it was only $8. What I’m disgusted with is how it arrived in the package. It was dirty and covered in hair (animal & human).
3.0,"the buckle that holds the fastener together came off in 2 minutes, held on with a staple!  other than that its holding up for now... very cheap though!"
3.0,Thought it was a charm you could add to a charm bracelet. Turned out it was a &#34;link&#34; in a bracelet. Wish they had one that is just a charm.
3.0,I can see through them and they fit. Correction. They don't fit well. They started popping out.
3.0,"This suit looks so nice on me - a perfect fit!  However, the dye came off the straps and onto my shoulders - so unexpected & disappointing."
3.0,"Though it's a &#34;reuseable&#34; bag, its kind of flimsy.  I wanted to return but they were going to charge me a shipping fee that is almost half the cost I paid for the bag.  I figured I will use it for dirty towels etc at the beach.  Not a fan of the bag."
3.0,I really wanted these grippers for my husband shoes but they will just barely go over my sneakers.  Size 8 women's. It also stated that they would come with extra spikes to use to replace ones that got lost. No extra spikes. They help on my shoes on the ice. Not on a mans.
3.0,Has longer length..
3.0,Sweater is lightweight and fits a bit large.
3.0,"I'm 5'9 145lbs, got the large and it was way too small. The drawstring sat about an inch above my navel. Very unflattering. If you are petite this would be an adorable dress for you as the material and quality were great."
3.0,Took forever to get here. These earrings are very delicate and could break very easily.
3.0,The material is strange. It has a crispness to it and feels almost like a uniform. I was told it looks like a nurses smock. I expected it to be soft and flowy. It isn't as long as it appears in the picture. I would not wear it with leggings.
3.0,"Super adorable color and shoes, afordable, but as soon as I pulled them out of the package, the chemical smell was overpowering. Not sure if we want crazy chemicals leeching into our kiddo's skin soooo we probably won't wear these."
3.0,"The band is OK quality, not as soft as the original. The included tools are worthless, they absolutely do not work."
3.0,Cute but fits much larger than expected 😔
3.0,There's no indication of wool/cashmere content any where.  They're a little thicker than regular dress socks but not as warm as expected.  Not worth the price.
3.0,"Only OK, I bought this to dress up the presentation of a lovely pair of earring I bought online, but which just showed up in a cardboard box. I ended u up using the cardboard box after all because this had a cheap wal-mart kind of feel, but considering the price it was OK."
3.0,"feels and looks just ok, kinda cheap. but is was.  adjustable length hard to adjust without pulling your hair"
3.0,"Nice, light weight scarf, but one corner is not finished correctly."
3.0,"Pretty blouse, just not much room in it!"
3.0,I was disappointed. They ran small. I hate returning products so I repurposed then
3.0,The print was more like printed on versus dyed. It didn’t feel like the pictures looked and it was huge
3.0,"The shirt is ok but the waist of the pants is too tight. Also, I am returning it."
3.0,"I give these gloves a 3/5.<br />SAEFTY: They have protected during a slide pretty well.  My hands didn't get hurt at all.<br />TOUCH: I often use my phone while stoped on my bike. These gloves some times work. Only on the specific spot on the thumb works. Cold phones also are hard to use. I would often fail to unlock my homescreen during cold weather riding. Might just be my phone those because sometimes it works fine.<br />HEAT: I commute 30 miles to work every day on my motorcycle.  I go about 70 to 90 most of the time. When it was 28f out, my fingers would still get a mild form of frost bite. The heater helped, but even full power didn't stop numbness in the conditions I ride in.<br />BATTERY: It would last 1 hour at full power in sub freezing conditions.  Good for short commutes (I do this), but bad for anything longer.<br />DURABILITY: The gloves suffer from success. The batteries are stored in a pocket secured by velcro. The velcro's ability to stay together was stronger than the stitching. See picture.  My advice to manufacturer is to double stitch.  My advice to users is to only over lap the velcro by 50% so it takes less forces to open."
3.0,Order for skiing but a bit too thin.
3.0,Love the idea but....My hand is too big and I had trouble getting it on.<br />Wish they made this bracelet in different sizes.
3.0,I’m usually a M in reg women’s sizing but L in cheaper material clothes. Nice casual dress. Very stretchy but size up so it won’t be see through
3.0,Super cute but very disappointed that it didnt fit as expected. I usually can wear between a medium and large. But this large fit smaller than expected.
3.0,"Super cute dress, but the fit was not great for an hourglass shape. It was too tight and see-thru across the hips/bottom. From the picture I thought it would have a little bit more flare to the skirt."
3.0,"Runs about right for the sizng, material is pretty soft but seams are a bit off. Still amazingly cute for my son though! There wasn't a newborn some available so we purchased the 3-6mo sizing for him to eventually grow into and now I'm thinking that order another set in the larger sizes so he can wear later as well."
3.0,The stones fell out after a couple days. Th they are good other than that
3.0,This product is good in keeping you warm but the quality of it is medium.
3.0,I went off the size chart and ordered a size 5.5 for my son who's foot is just under 5&#34; long.  They were way too big.  I would normally keep them but I'm afraid he won't need sandals (weather wise) by the time he grows into them.  Otherwise they are just as pictures and a cute sporty style. I was also not so sure about the velcro strap on both ends - you can't really tighten the top of the shoe to make it tighter.
3.0,Much smaller than appears in pic
3.0,"I like  all-cotton pajamas, and these are organic cotton.  But at 5'3&#34; and 110 lbs., the medium size is short in sleeve, leg and shirttail length.<br />They need to make them more generous,. Also the cute pencils printed on it are pretty stiff.  Sadly, I am disappointed, as it is difficult to find quality cotton clothing."
3.0,"I’m 5’3 130lbs ordered a size 3. Waist fit great, BUT, these pants are so sooooo long! I have a least a foots length worth of extra pant leg."
3.0,Not a bad product for the price. But it didn’t have enough compression and ran a bit large.
3.0,I got an XL. So the padding in the suit is a little weird and looks weird shaped when you put it on. Besides that fits as expected. Wish I could figured out how to get it right around my bust without it digging into my neck.
3.0,They fit kind of small so I would recommend getting one size bigger.
3.0,"I like it, but I was hoping the color was a little more deeper burgundy."
3.0,I thought I had ordered male chain extenders. From the picture you can see that the two are not equal in size. Do you have an extender that is the same size as my chain?
3.0,I didn't get what was shown but instead 3 that were all the same. Very dark green. So dark that unless it's a very bright day I can't hardly see. I am hoping to get these replaced with what the order was supposed to consist of.
3.0,"It was comfortable when I tried it on, but it was to small. My toes was hanging out of the shoe."
3.0,The material is nice and thick. The bust area is baggy but the waist fits. It looks as if it just hangs there. Wouldn’t recommend.
3.0,clasp come loose too easily
3.0,"I bought these for my wife, who has some leg circulation issues. Despite ordering the XL, they were very tight and uncomfortable for her. I tried them on (as I have skinnier calves) and they were really tight for me too."
3.0,I had a pair of gloves but they didn't keep my hands warm so I bought these. These don't really keep my hands warm either even though they were advertised to do so.
3.0,"First 2 times I bought them they were perfect. This last time, the ear loops are too big! So they went from perfect fit to too loose...<br />otherwise material is soft and comfortable, they don’t break, but I don’t know I will continue to buy since they don’t fit just right anymore..."
3.0,I love the wallet and how it functions but the color I got was substantially lighter than the photo in the add. Disappointed because I really like the darker color. It would affect my likelihood to reorder.
3.0,Not worth buying. Rip easily.
3.0,"It's... just okay. It's a dress made of cheap fabric, and the seams are uneven. I think it's overpriced for what it is."
3.0,It looked bigger on line.
3.0,"I love this cardigan however the sleeves go to a little under my elbow, nowhere near my wrists! I am 5’3 with shorter arms, so I cannot imagine how this would fit on someone with longer arms."
3.0,They are very cute. I did not get all the pieces with my order and two of the chain broke the first time I wore them.  But you get many with your order. You need to be very careful with the beaded ones. They break very easily.  The gold chain one and silver chain one seem to be the two sturdiest.
3.0,It was embarrassing for my daughter to come out of the water. She had to release water from the waterproof gusset because it held water like a water balloon. Could be that they need to be tighter.
3.0,Very thin material. Not able to wear it to work which is why I returned it
3.0,"A nice top. Very thin, which can be nice for summer. Ever line shows under it. And ladies, don't get chilled in this shirt if you don't want to be embarrassed.  Other than that, it's comfy. Better as a wear around the house shirt or a late soing'summer shirt"
3.0,I loved these bands at first comfortable and secure but I started to notice I was getting a rash under my band and then realized it was coming from the clasp. Not sure what it’s coated with but my skin is extremely irritated and itchy from it.
3.0,"The trouble with this dress is it hugged the hips in such a way that the skirt rode up and then stayed up too easily. I ordered it in a large and I'm usually a medium, and it still fit too tight in the hips.  I then had to return it and order an extra large, but the top portion and waist were then too big so I had to take the dress to the tailor to have it made to fit better, so it ended up not being as big a bargin as I wanted it to be. It is a pretty dress, just a lot of trouble to get it to fit right."
3.0,"They were smaller than expected, but the overall quality of these earrings are good. The earrings do not feel cheap and they come nicely packaged."
3.0,"Ordered the red skirt in size XS. First of all, the actual product I received was extremely too large which was disappointing. The tag says US XL so I don't know if they just accidentally shipped me the wrong size or if that's just what they are calling an XS? Also, the pockets are fake, it's just little flaps of fabric with buttons that don't fasten down. The red skirt also does not have a bow on the back like the other review photos have but I will probably just add one myself.<br /><br />All-in-all the fabric quality is nice. It is medium weight and feels like a satin/poly blend. I like the color. I ended up tailoring the skirt myself and fixing the straps since they were too long and now the skirt fits and is very cute. I'm keeping it but I just wanted to let you know that it required a good amount of customizing to make it work."
3.0,"I bought these because I didn't want a thick elastic band at the waist. However, I was disappointed to discover they instead have a rather scratchy thin seam with less stretch than I'm used to at the waist. The colors are nice, and the fabric is decent."
3.0,Pretty dress but super duper tight. I'm a size 8-10. Bought a medium and it's super tight and shorter than expected. I'm 5 ft 5 and it didn't even reach my ankles...
3.0,"No problems with the seller, just not as dark as I had hoped."
3.0,Bought as a Halloween accessory.  It's cute but comes apart to easy.  You can put it back together though.  It's just a pain to keep fixing it.
3.0,Loved the color and look but cheaply made.
3.0,A little small for my big head!
3.0,The fabric is less confortable as I imagined by the add
3.0,Already lost a screw back.  The whole reason I got them.  Good quality for the price.
3.0,Cute necklace. Probably better for a teen or child.
3.0,This was a great deal for the price!  The sizing does seem to be for men. The material is super soft and quite lightweight.
3.0,"I purchased the black pair which is more like a dark charcoal as opposed to black. The look was still good even though the color was not spot on.<br />I am athletic build and usually have trouble getting the right size but had no issues with these pants. The length was just right as well. The pants are great for year around wear. I was hoping to use them during the summer months while riding my motorcycle.<br />Unfortunately, the zippers were not aligned. I noticed other consumers posted similar dissatisfaction. If you don't mind lining the zipper, these pants should work well. The zipper appeared to be cheaply made and did not work out for me. I was able to get a refund. If you found my review helpful, please click the helpful link. If you have any questions about the cargo pants, let me know."
3.0,"This is a item that resembles something out of a gumball machine.<br />The advertised picture vaguely matches.<br />Pictured: high gloss sterling silver finished appearance.<br />Expect: high quality smooth sheet metal.<br />The price most likely covers the product itself, and shipping.<br />A cute trinket at best."
3.0,the waist band is some what rough and irritating.
3.0,The case is absolutely gorgeous with vibrant colors when it first arrived in the mail. After about a week or so the case becomes extremely dirt from daily use. It only holds about ONE card being it an ID or a debit/credit card. Being that the case was extremely cheap I guess you get what you paid for.
3.0,"Update: Was able to order a size up (12-24 month) for my 6 month old. It fits, but barely. The top button is snug and has no give at all but I could make it work. The top is gigantic and definitely will it work. Also, it came stained. Sending it back, again, and ordering, again, in hopes the third time is the charm. Pics attached.<br /><br />Original review: So bummed about this. It is SO adorable and I so badly wanted to keep it, but the top button is so tight on my baby. The shirt and straps were a little large too. I could have made those work, but the top button being too tight just wouldn’t work. I would definitely order the size up if they had it in stock for Christmas. For reference, my baby is 6 months old, 15.5lbs, 26” and I ordered the 6-12 month."
3.0,Love the size and color but the drawstring for it is way to long. It hangs all the way down to my knees and even when its tied up it hangs to mid thigh.
3.0,"Good craftmanship, good color, i has a lot of details that you can really appreaciate and that make the earring cool to watch. Although it is a little bit small for my ear and my other complaint is that they only sell one earing and i thought i would be cooler to add at least one small earing with a dragon stamped on it"
3.0,"Decent face masks, low price."
3.0,"I wish they were better quality, they only look nice. They are made from very cheap materials. I do like them but wont purchase again... I know I can get better quality glasses for 25.00"
3.0,Not very sturdy!
3.0,"They fit the glasses perfectly, but were a lot lighter than I had expected.  They are plastic, and the original ones were much heavier, possibly glass."
3.0,"the vest fit fine.  The jacket fit, but had to get the sleeves altered (a bit long).  The pants are too tight!!!  (the pants are a SLIM cut...)"
3.0,"I love the design of the necklace, but the metal is really cheap and tarnished after about 2 weeks."
3.0,it's a great idea to make this kind of calendar. But in such size Calendar's numbers and symbols almost unreadable because its are very small and thin. I'll look for perpetual calendar with biger size.
3.0,I am a plus size person and this shirt is adorable.  I love the look and feel. It now has a tear in the sleeve along the seam. I have worn it 3xs. Very poor craftsmanship.
3.0,My granddaughter loves the watch. Unfortunately the band fell apart after a week. It does keep time well. It is a pretty watch. It was not sewn well.  I will try to have the band fixed.
3.0,It looks cheap...
3.0,"I had high hopes for these shoes, and wanted to wear them for my wedding.  The fit was off, so I returned them.  They're cute, but I ended up going with something else."
3.0,Waist part continuously rolls and slides down when sitting. Very fashionable though
3.0,"Do People just guess what a medium, large, or XL is in men's shirts. There is no sizing norm that you can go by when buying online. The shirt itself is nice looking but the size is way too small. Please figure out a way to make something that is similar to the size you portray it to be."
3.0,"I initially thought the elastic on these snoods was stout enough to do the job. But when I really started using the snoods, I found the elastic to be too flaccid to keep the snood in place. The snoods keep falling off my head, although some are better than others.<br /><br />But in general, the circumference of these snoods needs to be made smaller, and the elastic on them more taut. As it is, I have to use a bevy of bobby pins to have even a fighting chance of holding one of them in place. That defeats my whole purpose in using the snoods. I order them primarily to wear when going through airport checks - so I don't have to use any metallic hairpins or bobby pins that will trigger an alarm and necessitate my having to take my whole hair-do apart."
3.0,I had to give these to my daughter because they were a bit to tight for me and I figured the next size up would be too big.
3.0,"This t-shirt is not organic. As soon as I took it out of the bag, I could tell the material was synthetic. It is 35% cotton and 65% polyester. No thanks!"
3.0,"I ordered this in light blue. What I got is definitely a Kelly Green.  It is loosely woven almost &#34;mesh&#34; like style which I did not expect based on the picture.  Also, I am 5'3&#34; and 125 lbs and this is pretty tight on me.  All that said, it is a functional shrug that I'm sure I will find something to match."
3.0,They fit right on your calves they were big on my feet . Too much of a hassle to return . I should have read the one review they are too tight on calves just as other review said
3.0,"Socks aren’t as long as the previous socks I’ve ordered. Therefore, I returned them."
3.0,Size is short. Creeps down easily.
3.0,"I was disappointed with the color. On screen it looks like that bubblegum candy neon pink, and when it arrived it was like a shade lighter than salmon. The lines however are very flattering"
3.0,"The earings are super cute but a tad on the heavy side, I like the magnet screw on backs but they are just to heavy for me to wear."
3.0,Cute top for the price and style is flattering. I would size down. I went for M but should have stayed with S which is typically my size. I ordered the Ginger color but received a mustard color. Still a nice color but not what I was expecting. Am returning the top to size down and hopefully get the top in the correct color.
3.0,"I REALLY wanted to like this shirt. The colour is perfect, the fit is perfect, the front looks amazing. But the back- the straps are twisted in a way that I don’t like. So, if you’re not obsessed with perfect straps that aren’t twisted up then you will probably really love this tank."
3.0,"In general it’s just want I was hoping it was, makes some noise when you move, has some heft to it which is nice. However pretty big for me ( I’m a size 2) and did not come with the strings to tie it closed.<br /><br />I need it for an Orville Peck concert in Nashville this week so I won’t be returning it, but I will modify it to fit me and use leather ties which will be cuter than the string it’s supposed to come with anyway.<br /><br />Would probably fit a size 5 minimum"
3.0,Asked for 28mm and they came waaaay smaller
3.0,"The blouse is a pretty as it looks,  but it runs small. I  ordered a 2X size and it was so small it fitted well on my friend whose size Small-medium"
3.0,"slippers are somewhat small.  a size 9-10 is more on the 9 size, than the 10 size."
3.0,I really liked the way it looked and felt - nice & soft.  I don't carry a purse & keep my wallet in my jeans.  This wallet was too long and would be easy to steal.
3.0,"My husband loved the ring. We expected the ring to be small (you can barely see the eyes) because of the price, but it is beautiful overall."
3.0,"The dress I received was similar to the photos but not quite right. The sleeves were inset instead of dropped which gives the top a different look and feel. There isn’t a snap or button to secure the inner part of the wrap so I’m going to have to make some modifications.<br />The colour was also significantly different and was more of a washed out green instead of the jewel tone of the photos.<br />It’s also quite long so I’ll have to hem it.<br />On the plus side, the wrap belt is long enough and wide enough to give the waist the right feel.<br />Overall I like it enough to keep it even though it isn’t exactly the dress advertised."
3.0,"This bracelet has a Great look and a good addition to my growing Dragon collection.  The type of clasp that it has is not my favorite but I knew that before I purchased it. So I will not mark it down for that. As you can see by the pics how it comes to you. I would show it to you on my arm but it said it was 8.66” but as you can see in the picture it is 8”. It will not fit my 7.5” wrist but will fit my spouse’s 6.5” wrist. Maybe they left a couple of links out.  I would return it if it didn’t fit my wife but would really like a larger one for me. I really do like the look of this.<br />I did receive this product at a reduced price in order to do an unbiased and honest evaluation which this is. I make these as honest as I can base on my experience because I know how much I depend on the reviews when I am looking at different products. If my review is helpful for you in any way, please click the [YES] bottom below. Good Shopping and Thanks for reading"
3.0,Super cute but too small.  I returned
3.0,"I got a size bigger than what I normally wear, and they were too small. Will be returning. Cute jeans though."
3.0,It stretches out or grows at you wear it. But still super cute and comfy
3.0,Feels cheap. I like the design but it just feels so light and cheap. I hope it's real stone. It probably is as it feels warm to touch when I'm wearing it. Usually plastic won't get warm when worn. So I think it's real stone. The color is nice and I love Larimar stone. It is just so light that it feels cheap.
3.0,I was disappointed to open the box and find that the silver was very badly tarnished.
3.0,Fabric is super soft and dress fits well. Only critique is the dress is a tad too long.
3.0,"I returned. They ran small and seemed uncomfortable, allowing for their being a little tight."
3.0,"These performed as well as the running socks I purchased at Target a few months back.  The compression factor did not make any difference.  The socks run small and the larger version began to tear when putting them on my size 11 foot.<br />Overall, I'd just purchase a thin sock at another store.  Don't purchase if your foot is over a size 11.  Otherwise, give them a try.  The reviews for this item are suspect."
3.0,"I would say it's just okay, it gives a little nudge in the right direction, their method of making it tighter has room for improvement though.  You spin the plastic piece in the back, I find that I need all three spins that the book says in allowed (could really use a couple more, maybe I needed the next size down) but it unspins itself and doesn't stay where it's set."
3.0,Doesn't have the detail as pictured.
3.0,it&#34;s ok .......
3.0,Fits rigth
3.0,"This did not come with Spring rods. My Redline watch had a band with really narrow shoulders, so I had to cut the last nib off either side to get a fit. It does seem durable enough, hopefully will last longer than the original band did."
3.0,"Aside from the package containing glasses with incorrect magnification, they appear to be good quality readers."
3.0,Bought this band because bands I've had before invariably rot and break. This band is more durable but feels cheaply made. It does the job but is nothing special
3.0,A little to light weight
3.0,"I wear a women's 7-7.5 and bought the small/medium ones. If I put my heel where it belongs, my toes don't even reach the gray toe part. If I put my toes in the right place, the heel is up near my ankle. They are fine for sleeping (which is why I bought them) but I wouldn't try to wear these under shoes."
3.0,"Love the material and the look, however it is constantly loosening up and falling off. Needed to double knot it to stay on."
3.0,nose paint was chipped when received.
3.0,"I purchased a 34 dd and it ended up being way too small. I was unfamiliar with the way bras are sized. I've learned the smaller the band size the bigger the cup size and vice versea. Not the company's fault my own. I love the durability of this item though, very greatly made"
3.0,Beautiful glamorous dress but sheds sequins a lot and came with two matching tears on the inside.
3.0,I thought the tank tops would be more compression and hold all matters in.  Well the tank tops did not do what I thought they would do.  Maybe I bought them to large. On to try something else.
3.0,seems a bit cheaply made besides the screw back I don’t think I would have bought them if I seen in person
3.0,Not easy to put on. After they're  on comfortable
3.0,Arrived on time. looks good. Only complaint is it is too big and only has two hole sizes. And I am a decent size guy. I have to put a brown hairband around it to keep the circumference closed. The flap at the end of the band also does not lay flat. It stick straight out.
3.0,"I ordered a small & this ran a little big on me. It’s a little baggy on top & in the butt, but still looks cute on. fabric does not look at all the same in real life as in the pictures. I give it 3 stars because it didn’t look like the picture."
3.0,Cue and love the way they look. Are a little heavy for my ears and liking but fun to wear for short periods of time.
3.0,This bag is described as a black and white color block.  Please be warned - it is not white.  It is black and ivory.
3.0,"worth about what I paid for it. Main disappointment is that the sole has ridges on the top surface, and there isn't enough padding in the lining to keep the wearer from feeling this on the bottom of the foot."
3.0,I used It over a shell
3.0,"It fit well only thing was that the design was a bit different it was not exactly the same style as shown. It was more a sleeveless dress, the picture looks like the waist line was a bit scrunch or more defined but it wasnt. However it still look well and came out ok."
3.0,This is just okay... It feels cheap and gets tangled practically as soon as you breathe on it. If you add an extender it hangs awkwardly so I added one extender to each side. I didn't like it and wished I hadn't bought it.
3.0,"I was looking for gloves that would make it easier to handle my roses. Well, today I trimmed my roses and the gloves are not thorn proof."
3.0,I’m not a fan that the camo material is cheap sublimation material.
3.0,"Prior to arrival, I was hoping for some nice looking earrings that did not do me biological harm. These fit that bill, and had a shine to them that earned me many compliments from my girlfriend's family (wore them at Thanksgiving - the first time I had met any of them.) However, these fantastic earrings have the un-fantastic habit of falling out during routine activity - never to be found again. I went through the usable sizes of the pack in two weeks, and unless you like looking at public floors with your smartphone flashlight, I'd get something a little more solid."
3.0,the paint started scratching the first day.
3.0,Was a bit smaller than expected
3.0,Slightly short and a tad tight.  However I am 5'11&#34;
3.0,Sign is not very obvious. Silk material for apron is odd.
3.0,"Fit everywhere, except way too large in the waist area.  Otherwise it would have been a cute dress."
3.0,Thought the mesh texture would help with the sweat but not really
3.0,Vivid colors. Good stretch. Fits nice. Will probably be matched with sharp colors to make a statement.
3.0,"I like the size and style of this purse. So I'm giving it 3 stars.  However, if you're looking for a real leather purse pass on this one.  The picture looks like leather and the product description indicates that it is a leather purse, but it clearly is not.  I'm thinking seriously of returning it."
3.0,The nylon strap came apart the first time I wore it.  Had only been sewn with one line of thread; should have been more reinforced.
3.0,It's not slim. Wallet gets thick very quickly with adding a few cards. Looks elsewhere if you truly wants a slim wallet.
3.0,"They're crooked and too wide for my head but I didn't expect much considering I bought them online and they're so cheap.  Aesthetically, they're adorable, though and I've received many compliments every time I wear them."
3.0,It is really cute but too short. I gave it to someone.
3.0,It will work -
3.0,These are great lights when they work. Roughly 30% of the 40 lights were defective.
3.0,Beautiful dress and fit nicely but very cheap material.  The seams were already falling apart when I took it out of the bag.  Returning this.
3.0,The print was not like the actual pictures.
3.0,Great idea but would stick to my nipples and itchy
3.0,Great quality but the sizing seams off. I ordered an XL the skirt fits perfectly but it seams like the top is a large. Which stinks because I really liked the quality.. so I'm not sure how to alter it.
3.0,"Smells terrible! It's adorable and fit my 4 year old great, but I couldn't give it to her as a Christmas gift since it needed to be washed first."
3.0,"Cute dress, nice material. Top was too big and bottom too tight. Returned.<br />5’5” 190 lb and size 42 D chest got xl for reference"
3.0,It looks like it will work but the straps are all twisted and it will take some time to fix them so they lay flat while in use.
3.0,"this beanie should be labeled as for boys instead of men. It’s super small, it gave me a head ache but maybe it will stretch over time?"
3.0,The masks I received look like the ones in the pictures but they aren’t 100% cotton and they do not have nose wire for an adjusted fit. It’s not worth sending them back since they were relatively cheap and can be used in a pinch but not really what I was looking for.
3.0,"Nice, not heavy, but the 1st time trying them on I did get an allergic reaction on the back of my earlobe. I toughed it out for the sake of my outfit lol! After the 1st encounter they didn't hurt or itch."
3.0,Super cute bag but a lot smaller than I thought it would be.
3.0,Fits great bu the material was much heavier than I expected.  Beautiful top but heavy.
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes bigger than my normal size and they were still tight. But they look and feel nice.
3.0,"I got these quickly in the mail, not even two weeks wait. Some of the rings look plastic, but they are all metal. The bow ring is my favorite out of the bunch. Even though some look like they could be tightened or loosened for a better fit, they are actually not adjustable. Luckily most of the rings fit, except for the fingernail ring, which is too big for me. :("
3.0,Not great quality but ok for the price
3.0,"Pretty, nice pockets, fit is good.  But I failed to note it is 95% polyester. That means<br />it is rather hot and doesn't breathe well.<br /><br />Also note it is very, very thin. This means that it is extremely lightweight, and that is good if you are looking for  that.<br /><br />Any body part it is in contact with will show through (I had the blue and white one).  Not<br />appropriate for wandering around in the yard. :-)"
3.0,"It looks great, got it as a gift but runs small. May need to adjust"
3.0,It's cute but the material is low quality
3.0,Just saying you should expect a smaller product than you imagine based on the pictures
3.0,Bit larger than I like but they'll do.
3.0,I am a server and struggle to fine a good Pair of pants that fit professionally and that are durable enough for squatting and bending. I thought I had finally found a pair after i received these. The fit was was amazing they have belt loops for us curvy girls who struggle to find something that accentuates the booty but fits the hips. They are kinda high waisted to hide the muffin and they are straight legged. They have the perfect balance of stretch and compression. I was literally in love with these pants until I washed them for the third time and they started falling apart.
3.0,cute dress and it fit everywhere but in the bust. Buttons pulled.
3.0,Material is not that good but the design and color are lovely all in all .. There are better brand and more valuable deals if u wanna a shirt
3.0,fur falls off a lot
3.0,Purchased for my daughter to make bracelets. Really cute but the only issue is not all of the charms are useable. Some of the holes where missing.
3.0,Update: wish I can keep a good review but it just didn't stay in position very well and the metal already broke for one of them and I cannot use the earring anymore. :(<br />-------<br />these are so so cute! Comfortable too :)
3.0,They were not as fashionable as I wanted them to be.  They looked a little funny on.
3.0,Cute but headband was ripped when it arrived and it was wet
3.0,watch is very nice but band is very hard to fasten.
3.0,"I like the top, I like that  the bottoms can be worn on the solid black or stripes. Only complaint is that  I thought they would come up a little higher on the waste- That was my purpose of buying this."
3.0,"I like the dress, but it's too small. You should order the next size up."
3.0,"Large breast ladies avoid! I am a 34DD and 5’2”.  I ordered a Medium- shorts fit great, top was short and there is zero room for anyone packing more than a 34B.  I would buy this product again if I could order split sizes.  It is well made and looks exactly like the picture! Perfect fabric for sleeping/lounging."
3.0,It was a see through long shirt but not thick material and huge.
3.0,Pretty. Not sterling as described.
3.0,"Poor quality sewing and material. After much ironing, it worked. I've worn it twice and it's still holding together. Shape and color are exactly what I wanted. Sizing is small."
3.0,"The arm holes are awkward as is the neck/shoulder space.  It is also a tad long to be flattering on someone 5'4.  With a couple of professional alterations, I loved the dress."
3.0,It'd ok a little cheesy.
3.0,"The print is super cute.  The fabric is weird.  It is kind of heavy polyester.  Not what I expected in a summer dress.  I think the colors look different in real life then in the photo, brighter."
3.0,Cute shoe with lots of footbed padding but a little slim in the toe box and pretty stiff for fabric shoes.
3.0,I got lots of compliments on the shirt!
3.0,Like my jeans high rise. Not enough stretch.
3.0,Runs small. Made from a linen poly blend.
3.0,sizing is cut on the slim side
3.0,"Shirt and Pants fit according to the Size Chart.  This is definitely not “linen” but the fabric looks nice.  It is heavier than expected for a “Summer”, “Beach” outfit.  Maybe early Spring/late Fall, but would otherwise be too warm.<br />3 stars for the “linen” reference in the listing and the inability to wear in hot weather."
3.0,It’s beautiful...not worth the cost. Thought it was two earrings but just one. But daughter will work with it.
3.0,the clasp broke after a few wears but it was cute
3.0,Gems keep falling off
3.0,"Socks are too short. Do not come up to the knee, so they slide down"
3.0,"The coating on the metal flakes off and they bent really easy, they looked nice though."
3.0,One size fits very small in my opinion.  I can wear medium to large size and this was way too tight on the tummy and hips. I sent back for a refund. It felt like nice quality but it wasn't a good fit on me.
3.0,"Hey there! I ordered a large - I am 5 foot 3 and a half, 124 pounds, bra size 32DDD, with short-ish legs. This costume BARELY fits me. It squishes the crap out of my boobs, is oddly loose in the belly and crotch but at the same time, I wouldn't want it tighter in the crotch so I'm ok with that. It is all one piece, and the glove portions are very tiny (and I have tiny hands and fingers) so what I am going to do is cut out holes in the thumbs and fingers (also so I can use my phone too) and just paint my nails bright red.<br /><br />I am definitely going to use it because the events I'll be wearing it to will just be 3-4 hours long, but I don't even think an extra large would have mattered because of the odd cut and shape. But, for the money, and for the fact that it is entirely one piece, I am pleased. I might try other sellers for future costumes, though."
3.0,"High rise and short legs... wish they were a lower rise, then the legs would probably be long enough."
3.0,"I ended up selling this to a friend, it was just too big for me."
3.0,This was purchased as a gift for my teenage niece and was not as high of quality as I'd anticipated and hoped but I suppose it was adequate for the price.
3.0,"The band is a little on cheap side, but hey, for the money, not a bad deal at all.  Looks pretty good too."
3.0,Not as tight as I would uave liked. I found it big. I'm 5'6 144lbs and it was very loose. I expected it to fit like athletic wear.
3.0,Not so nice as I expected .
3.0,Little bit big but nice though.
3.0,They're okay. Feet were constantly cold though
3.0,It's a nice pendant and the design is very pretty. The only thing is that it really isn't that big so it does get lost I think. still very nice though.
3.0,"This is a cute MetroCard holder.  I wouldn't say it is sturdy enough for heavy usage with IDs and charge cards.  I used it daily and had it for approximately a year before it finally broke in half at which point I continued to use the half until that tore.  It is all plastic and stitched together.  I would say that it is definitely not worth the money I spent but I didn't return because I just liked the design.<br /><br />Recommend? No, not necessarily.  I'm sure you can find something at a better price...perhaps the dollar store"
3.0,"Looked pretty but i was disappointed to see that the back was tarnished and there was a small defect on the side. Bought this for my anniversary, I know my fiancé will like it but i wish it was a better quality product"
3.0,It's overall more brown than purple or blue.
3.0,It is way too small... not a large by American standards.
3.0,"I ordered XL since I decided to go up one size just in case. I wear L/XL in the Papi brand so I thought I’d go XL. I tried these on and the XL was a super tight fit as though it was a size Medium. I’m assuming these are made for slim, lean individuals.  The material is a little thick and stretchy but not for the reg avg bodies that have a little bit of love handles. Go 3 sizes up!"
3.0,"For the most part it fits as expected. The zipper on the side is a tad weird but it isnt horrible, just awkward. It probably looks better in a slimmer size"
3.0,"They're not quite as cute as the picture but for the price they are ok. The posts were crooked which sort of added to the &#34;cheap&#34; feel. Overall, I will keep them and wear them but I'm not as excited with them as I hoped to be."
3.0,it fit well and I like it
3.0,Smaller than what I expected but looks just like the picture
3.0,Looks like good quality material. Fit in waist and hips but legs too wide. Didn’t fell<br />Like altering so sent them back.
3.0,I mean....idk if this is a counterfeit product or not. The stitching is not straight and it came all frayed and whatnot.<br /><br />Aside from that it works and it feels nice so whatever.
3.0,A good solid shoe but the vamp seems more appropriate for an older woman.  I felt it made my foot look old and I want to look comfortable but hip.
3.0,"This is such a cute shirt, but the words “adult sizing” is inaccurate. This shirt a is junior size."
3.0,Wanted an inexpensive watch I could use working outside and could just wash band off.  A little tight fitting & I have a small wrist but am keeping.<br />Good product for price.
3.0,Pants were perfect...top made a belly shirt 😂  its totally adorable so I'm keeping it.  Just dont expect the shirt to cover much of your child's stomach area.
3.0,Soft fabric though a bit big and long. I am 34A and ordered medium. Should have ordered small. It is pretty long (from just under arm pit to mid ribs).
3.0,The lights are fine except that three of them were shipped &#34;on&#34; and are now battery dead. Not bad but annoying.
3.0,It's not how it looked at amozon
3.0,I got the 2-4 size for my twin girls that just turned two last month. I wish I had gotten the next size up because this is not going to fit them for long and they are not big for their age.  They're maybe 27 pounds right now. It's really tight around the shoulders and rides up in the back. I have no idea how a 3 or 4 year old would fit into this.
3.0,"I ordered these leggings in a medium, I am 118 pounds and 5'4. They're short my the ankles and there is far too much crotch room. And they are not very stretchy at all."
3.0,This dress was definitely a &#34;costume&#34; rather than a dress you might wear out.  The material is what makes me say this.  It was pretty but the fit wasn't quite right.  Too big on top and an odd length.  It was purchased for a 5'5&#34; young lady that is on the thin side at 110 lbs.  The areas that are supposed to be &#34;fitted&#34; just weren't on her.
3.0,"My bracelet is actually not Morse code for Scorpio, the “i” is incorrect, but it’s still cute. No one is staring long enough to notice. But don’t expect it to be correct."
3.0,"Something wrong with this mask, it’s really wide and huge, seems like it was flattened, don’t fit seller’s size at all. Going to return this. But I like it’s quality. Maybe it’s some kind of defect."
3.0,"Clip ring is not large enough to use on belt loop. Only reason I like it at all, is the word Indian on it."
3.0,Bag is nice but hardware is cheap and easily broken.  Strap connector broke the first day I used it.
3.0,"I like these shorts. They are comfy and the material is thin enough to keep you cool, but thick enough to keep your undies a secret.<br />They do have a tendency to ride up, especially while biking."
3.0,"Buying clothes online can be hit & miss, but this range of clothing seems to make it a lottery.  I am 5'11 and 175 lbs.  I work out moderately and usually take US M.  However, the size US M I got was really tight across the chest and shoulders and even tighter on the arms.  Too small to wear so mine went into the clothing recycle bin.  Good looking jacket though."
3.0,"Doesnt look anything like the picture, the lens arent as shiny with that mirrored look so I am kind of disappointed."
3.0,"The material is good. However, the size is little small. It fit for the walking shoes that I bought together but wear them with other shoes were falling into the shoes. Otherwise I would like them."
3.0,I am 5'1 at 150 lbs ordered a large. Should have got an XL. Fabric is also scratchy. Cute tho
3.0,Very thin and very short. I am 5’9 and ordered a size bigger than I normally wear. This was very very short. I was in a pinch so it worked. And you get what you pay for.
3.0,I have hard time to find the bra which feet me. Not many companies make A38. This one is way too big both cups and width.
3.0,I love it but it's too big for my 7 year old whom I purchased for. It's suppose to hold up a loose mask but it's just too big mask still falls off.
3.0,"They are cute but not what I was expecting. There is white paper on the back of the turtles! I used some acrylic paint to color over the 'shocking white&#34; contrast, kind of a hassle, but looks better. Also, mine didnt come with earring backings, so if you lose earrings, make sure to borrow some backings from another pair you already own. Hope this helps!"
3.0,"I like that it's only 9"" long; it also has a pretty good ""coverage zone"" so to speak.<br /><br />But because of that, it's very difficult to wrap shut with the velcro. It's like a ball of nylon; you have to neatly fold each part so that, when you pull the velcro strap, it actually meets the other end."
3.0,It fit fine. but had a large hole in it so I returned it
3.0,"Its okay, its just kinda cheap but you could layer it with leggins and a jacket and you can possibly hide that. Its just okay.  But fits as expected if not maybe one size down. I did this picture review so you could see it.  Size large 170 lbs 5’2"
3.0,"This jumpsuit is very cute, but the lenght from the crotch to shoulders was too short. I ordered a size larger and had the same issue, only it was to big and still couldn't pull it up onto my shoulders."
3.0,Long and loose arms.
3.0,Passed it on to a young lady
3.0,It is too small.  I thought it would be a little bigger.
3.0,fit too large
3.0,The material is somewhat rough but the price was right.
3.0,Didn’t fit that well.
3.0,"I purchased this item to use on an African safari I am taking in the near future. Although it was marketed as a new item, when I opened it, there were a couple spots of a dry, black tar-like substance on the inner folds. I was able to scrape the substance off, but it left a stain which will not wash out. It is still quite usable, but just seems not new. Disappointed!!"
3.0,The size charts are not great. She usually wears an XL but that was a bit too big for this product. I also didn't like the way the neck left too much of her shoulders uncovered (for cold weather). I love the material. It is wildly plush and comfortable for her. I bought several types of PJs from this manufacturer.  All other Zexxy pajamas were better than this model. I hope this helps if you decide to try this product.
3.0,Silicone backing still caused infection in my ears.
3.0,It was not a good fit because I do not have a long torso therefore the beach area was a mistake fit. Plus didnt make my figure look good. Quality of product was there tho.6
3.0,"These were cute but so thin.  They seemed like they could easily bend.  The size was also not exactly right -- too small for my ring finger, so I wore one on my pinky and ended up losing it down a toilet.  True story.  If you are looking for really super tiny rings to layer, these might be for you.  I felt like they made my fingers look chubby just because they were so tiny."
3.0,My kiddo loves her jacket and it is super cute!  I bought a size that would normally be too big to have room to grow but it fits just right.
3.0,Not the same green as pictures.
3.0,Its nice but came a little damaged.
3.0,not silk - only partly silk (45%?) and the rest polyester.  disappointing.
3.0,I didn't they were sized too well.
3.0,"These socks look great, but they are very thin. I don’t know how long they will last due to how thin they are."
3.0,"It's smaller than I expected. I'm usually a 2x and wanted a loose hoodie to be comfortable in. While it is comfortable, the sleeves are too short and it's smaller than I imagined everywhere else. It also isn't long enough on my torso. But it's currently 19° so I'm not returning it."
3.0,"While this dress is very pretty and made well, it most certainly is NOT made of cotton, rather polyester. I still really like the dress, but I am disappointed in the fabric."
3.0,Hat wasn't what I really expected. Fit too small and was squished in shipping.
3.0,It’s a little too long and poofy. I’m tummy area. I have flat stomach and gives illusion of having belly . LOVE THE COLOR . But don’t see me wearing this .
3.0,This case gets condensation inside of it when you sweat. Pretty lame.
3.0,"I bent one of the earring backs the first time I wore them, but for the price it's to be expected. The back is a little long, though, and where the backs sit on the threading is set, so the earrings hang down (with post showing on the front side of the ear). Not sure if it's a design flaw or if I have very thin lobes, hah."
3.0,Tried it on returning. The top part is sewn way to high so where the skirt part starts goes in the middle if the breast area insyed of under. Color and material was correct and pretty not see through. There was also extra fabric on the top part its not tight like in the picture so it looks sloppy and awkward. If you have a smaller top maybe it would work for you
3.0,"Is there such a thing as a comfortable bra?  This one seems to fit okay.  Like some of the reviews does not lay flat in front and will show a ridge depending on how tight your shirt is.  Over all, it is better than most and not pricey."
3.0,"Its see through, that's my main complaint."
3.0,"My son loves them, but they run small."
3.0,Said true to size and I got large. Too small. They look very nice though. Nice color and material.
3.0,Grand kids loved them but out of 40 i would say 30% didn't work
3.0,The stones are actually smaller than on the picture. But the earrings are not bad. Especially if you don't like big earrings.
3.0,Two of the pills broke
3.0,Material to shear .... shouldn’t have to worry what can and can’t not be seen
3.0,"Its as pictured but came broken, twice. Missing a jewel first, returned and new one came with a broken pin. Oh well."
3.0,it is fine for a woman.
3.0,"Cute top. Fit runs a bit big and the material is very itchy, and the shoulders don’t stay put."
3.0,Beautiful dress to small for me. The sleeves don’t cover the top area for your bra. The length was great and the material.
3.0,Girlfriend likes these but i don't think she liked the lucky dots design.
3.0,"Really thin material, nice colors. More of a coverup then dress to go out in."
3.0,"Fit well, but the white part is see though. Even with a white bra."
3.0,Its ok. What can you expect for the price
3.0,"The top fit like I expected but the pants were slightly too large.  If you are looking for a fitted look to your pants, these won't cut it.  The top is great, though."
3.0,There should be a piece of metal to hold the strands in place. They end up twisted.
3.0,"An okay lanyard. The laminate card-holder is very flimsy, which is a bummer considering how often I need to used my magnetized ID badge at work. The latch is pretty durable and the lanyard rope itself is made of a non-fraying high quality material."
3.0,"Liked it, but it was too small!"
3.0,They were super tight and I kept having to fix them throughout the day!! Should not have to manage them as much as I did!!
3.0,very good ! but somewhat amall !
3.0,"Honestly what you feel about this bracelet completely depends on what you need it for. If you are looking for something to wear a few times, maybe to a Luau or something like that it would be fine. Definitely not made for every day wear. It is comfortable so that is a plus. It is adjustable so it will fit any arm. It’s a cute little bracelet but it looks cheap with little tiny fake diamonds in the gold shell on the front. This one is a toss up."
3.0,Really nice until 2 weeks in and the zipper broke.
3.0,"I bought these to wear to bed in an attempt to have less fuzzy hair in the morning. Unfortunately, they are quite large and generally end up slipping off my head in the night. They would be okay for someone who wants to just wear them around the house or out and about I guess. They just seem a bit large, and I don't have a small head. I would think people who perhaps have lost hair due to chemo would purchase these. It might be nice to have two sizes, small and large, so people trying to hide a massive amount of hair could and those with no hair don't have a huge cap falling off their heads."
3.0,Wasn’t flattering the way it bows out on the bottom
3.0,"The costume itself is decent. The fabric is decent material and it flows well. The fit was a little on the large side, but just slightly. It’s very long, it absolutely drags. The cape snaps onto the main body of the costume, however, my costume arrived without the snap on one side. I had to do my best with a safety pin on Halloween. I feel the placement could be better for where the hood sits. The cape was also very heavy and kept pulling up at the neck area, which was a little uncomfortable. I think it could probably use some work to get it to better fit, or maybe a lighter weight fabric for the cape would work. Overall, it’s pretty much what I imagined it to be."
3.0,"Very pretty, looks great, cant say much for the chain since i swapped it for a longer one but dont even think about water or sweating with this necklace on, wore it on while working in the rain for a day and the charm tarnished. Other then that though it was great."
3.0,I love the details but it looked like lower profile when I purchased it. It's a tall ring! It is pretty though! The price is nice. I'll carefully push the prongs down pin the top a bit. Voila!!! Low profile!
3.0,Not as thick or plush as the previous insoles I have. The label sewn on the hell is an irritation so I removed it. Never understood why any company would place a label on a pressure point!  I have one leg considerably shorter than the other so I stack the insoles in one boot to compensate.  Generally only have two in right boot but these are thinner so now I have three in right boot instead of only two. That's how much thinner these are. They seem to be shearling just not very thick. Both pictured are made in China.
3.0,"Well, you know that it is not the real deal, but those earrings look great, not cheap at all. I hope they are going to last without losing the spark."
3.0,"Unless you don’t mind it being completely see thru dress with a thin cheap material dress, do not buy.<br /><br />Ordered a small and they sent a large."
3.0,Pretty style but crystals are not very clear which makes them appear cheap. Would have returned but my daughter needed to wear them with her dress and did not have time to find another pair.  They worked for the one time event.
3.0,Supper cute . But the little fake jewls came off right away
3.0,"Cheaply made to me. Makes my ear hole hurt.<br />Definitely can’t wear them 2 days in a row.<br />I’m looking for others. Surgical steel post a must. These are not. If you buy them as a collector, cool.<br />If you buying to wear them, eeeehh I’d suggest another pair"
3.0,I hate that it has number at the back but it's not mentioned in the description and no picture for it
3.0,"Was not black;  was dark gray/charcoal.  Had large (12""x12""+-), square hole cut from bad location that ruined the use of a nice large area; created considerable waste."
3.0,I really really liked this dress. The material is nice and sewn well. Unfortunately I had to return due to not fitting my plus size bust.. I am a DDD cup and was unable to zip.. I bought my daughter a small she has DD cup and it fit her perfect..
3.0,Bought it for the tik tok
3.0,"This bracelet is real cute, but cheap it broke on my 1st day wearing it. So I would say it was a waste of money."
3.0,I ordered a size up and it was still a little small.
3.0,"I think the size reference should mention that their women’s sizes, and not your regular, standard, unisex T-shirt. If i it was going to be a woman’s large , I would’ve gotten up two sizes .a male large would’ve been just perfect."
3.0,Mine broke after about a week of wear. Definitely disappointed in that but the beads are good quality and I will be restringing them soon.
3.0,"This band is so poor, not sure where to start. First, it's too wide, makes installation a pain. (Had to remove the pin and take a pair of pliers to squeeze the width of the band narrower). Second, it's the lame, old-fashion pin system. Third, it's very short for a larger wrist. Fourth, boy is it stiff. Fifth, and maybe most annoying, is that the prong on the buckle is just a little too long, making it almost impossible to put it on or take it off. How can a silly watchband be so much trouble?<br />Any positives? Well, it is made sturdy.<br />-----Edited----<br />The seller is taking care of the problem very fairly. I will presume that this one may have been a defect?"
3.0,I am trying to decide about the suspenders.  The back clip frequently  doesn't hold properly.  I am hoping I can adjust the length and have them work better.
3.0,They are cute but over time they did end up turning my finger green
3.0,"This bathing suit is really cute. Unfortunately even though I ordered a bigger size, it was still to small."
3.0,3 stars because the lens are nt curved as advertised but flat. However i am still happy with it
3.0,"I wear this as a shirt. It's a little on the small size, size up"
3.0,I ordered XL for a 36DD definitely did not fit comfortably!
3.0,Love the sparkle the bead has as it catches light makes for a dressy touch. Very happy it came in black and other “neutral” colors. Only giving 3 stars because the main clasp broke 3 weeks after purchase.
3.0,"I ordered the navy and it was a completely different color blue. I preferred the navy color. The fit is a tad small but that’s the risk I run with my body type. Athletic build at 5’5 - 146lbs, 34 DDD. Overall cute dress for the price. I gave it to a friend."
3.0,"Run very small.  My 13 year old ordered these and they won't go over her top knuckle, some don't fit at all.  They are super cute.  But better for small fingers.  She wears on average, a 6 in rings.  I tried them too.  I wear 5 1/4, still didn't fit!  So unless you wear a size 4 or so, know they won't go to the base of your fingers.  Three stars b/c they are super cute, and she could still wear some.  But very disappointing."
3.0,Color not navy blue as described
3.0,Over all I like it.  It's soft and a pretty color.  There were a few loose pieces of yarn.  It's not heavy but it is comfy.  It is not as heavy a chenille as I have had before.  I hope it holds up.
3.0,the fit was a little tight and made it uncomfortable to keep on and breathe though.
3.0,I thought the bottom of the shorts were sewn to form a hem. They are not. Also I washed them once and the bottom frayed pretty badly.
3.0,It's nice for the price.  Dimensions are accurate but it's very low quality metal but it serves it's purpose
3.0,"Very comfortable,but the material is very thin. If you wear it outside you can see straight throw.."
3.0,I bought a size small. They felt a little more right than expected and are also a few inches too long. Still wearable. Nice thick material
3.0,Poor stitching. The product gave away after 3 uses.
3.0,"I like them  and the pattern is cute.  Very long for someone 5’3, but I run into that a lot. It’s a polyester light material but stretchy.  If I was 5’6 or above these would be great pants that you Could dress up and be comfy!"
3.0,Its cute but if your a bit chest size up from your regular size
3.0,"It's held up in the sh but beware, it's a very small medium. I would have returned it, but I lost the tags to send back with it."
3.0,"Ordered according to the size chart, but the dress was too large overall. The print and fabric made it look a bit cheap. Might try sizing down and buying the solid black."
3.0,This is a nice item but I ordered the XL it was too small then ordered the XXL and it was too big and then item was damaged.  I was really looking forward to wearing this item I am looking to purchase in White just hope I don’t encounter the same issue.
3.0,"My little guy is on the doctor's scale as Average height, thus shirt hits his  knees right now."
3.0,This is a nice bow tie. It's a little tight around the neck. But it's a really nice bow tie to have in your collection. 3.5 stars
3.0,Cute. Good fabric. Does not fit like most sizes. Go up a size if you want it to fit like the picture shows.
3.0,"This dress is very cute but the material pills and fades like crazy even when hand-washed in cold water. It also runs a bit large. I am pear-shaped and normally struggle with dresses being too tight on my lower half, but this one is almost shapeless even in my usual size because it is cut wide through the hips. On the other hand the arms and chest were quite tight on me, so sizing down wouldn't have worked either."
3.0,Kinked when arrived
3.0,"It makes legs look slim, but it is super tight. I'm not a very big person but these stuck at my butt and won't go up to the hip. I pulled very hard and it seems to broke it a little bit. I only wear these when I have to wear a ​very tight skirt for my suits."
3.0,Super cute but runs a little big. Not as fitted as in photo.
3.0,"I ordered an extra large, but it was still tight. I usually wear a large."
3.0,The fabric was nice but they sent me the wrong color. I was supposed to get grey with beige sleeves but they sent me beige with grey sleeves. Also the beige chest area was see through so I have to wear an undershirt which is annoying.
3.0,"So these look awesome, but they run very small. I wear 16mm and I wear teardrop style plugs often. These are probably at least .5mm smaller than the rest of mine. They’re still wearable, but I definitely have to leave my gauges out overnight to be able to wear them the next day. If you have larger gauges, you might consider sizing up."
3.0,"Bought size S and the fit is right for my 5-4, 140 lb frame. The quality is average for its price. I’ve noticed the inside pockets sewn are unfinished and the threads of the fabric fall out quite bit. I like the look of this dress so will keep it."
3.0,The color is a bit deceiving. I was expecting a white color with bamboo inner. However the actual product is bamboo colored all the way around. Haven't had any issues other than they fit a bit smaller than the other pairs of woodies. Will update upon further use.
3.0,"Lace top is nice but material is cheap, thin, and shows every bump and line.  Normally size 8, ordered a Large and it was snug .  Am returning"
3.0,Shorts were pretty small
3.0,Daughter loves that they light up but managed to rip the bows off on day one....Also...there is a weird peep toe thing happening that I didn't notice prior to purchasing them...beware.
3.0,"Socks are great quality, but the L/XL are way too big for women's size 8.5 with 15.5 inch calves. Gave them to my husband."
3.0,Cute boots but kind of tight.
3.0,"This robe is comfortable, but the price is not worth the quality. This is cute and that's all. I don't suggest getting the red because when I got it the white parts were already stained by the red. I followed the wash instructions and still now the white is pink. I'd say this robe is worth $15 not $30. I guess try the other colors just stay away from the red. Also the fit was fine. I'm 5'5 and got this for a hospital robe for after having my baby. So weighing 200 lbs it didn't close all the way due to the bump mostly, but I did want it a bit loose which is how it turned out. I'm sure if you weigh anything less than 200 it should close just fine."
3.0,I wear it as a nightgown...
3.0,Very pretty. Kinda small. Loops fell apart on first attempt to wear. Would not buy again. Should have returned them.
3.0,SHOES RUN NARROW.
3.0,"The fit was not very comfortable, but OK."
3.0,Like the wallets small size. However it’s hard to get the back two cards out.
3.0,The outfit was cute overall.  The only thing I did not like was the top was huge on my daughter!
3.0,"I ordered these after searching for fleece lined leggings for winter. Yep, that is not these. These are incredibly thin and silky so yeah it’s cold. They’re good for tall people though. Very long."
3.0,"They are tiny, very tiny, but nice"
3.0,Does not cover/lay well on back.
3.0,"The straps frayed and fell apart really quickly.  I bought another pair for my son forms vans directly ... SAME thing. Very disappointed with the brand for their poor quality in toddler shoes. None of the vans shoes that me and my boyfriend own have been so poorly made.<br />Other than the fraying straps and too quick to wear down toe top of the shoe, they look awesome and fit well and my son could walk and run really well in them."
3.0,"I loved these earrings! Great colors and good quality. But, one of the black earrings was missing the ear wire that goes through your ear."
3.0,Very very thin.  Very skeptical about it being able to keep ears warm.  Also very large circumference.
3.0,Did not receive  the same belt that was pictured. The belt received was white with the back side white with un-processed leather.
3.0,They look nice Butt their Small🤷i expected them to be a little Wider🤷IDK!! 😒They Cute tho
3.0,Pants were way to long had to return
3.0,Cute dress. Made super short. Can only be worn around the house or to the beach or pool. Wish it was longer. Super cute dress.
3.0,"The bracelet isn't quite what it appears on the model in the picture. It's bigger and bulkier; not as classy looking. The tails on the bracelets are really long too! Also, if you buy, make sure you check the knots on the tails. Mine was missing one so I had to spend 15 minutes fixing the bracelet -- what a pain. Would not recommend unless you have large wrists!"
3.0,"After one wash it shrunk a bit , I have many tshirts this wasn’t one of the most memorable one ."
3.0,"These are really cute and soft, had a bit of a chemical smell coming out of the package that dissipated, the shirt fits great but the pants... the pants have a strange cut, I thought I had them on backward at first, for the crotch to not hang between my knees I have to pull them well above my belly button. I'm keeping them, but do not think I would buy anything else from this brand due to the cut on the pants,"
3.0,Unfortunately it arrived with broken piece. I use it for design and decorating.
3.0,"They look nice, but are not durable."
3.0,Very warm but the inside lining is a little itchy. Definitely need something up underneath
3.0,"Very small, not much give in the fabric so it felt smothering compared to similar masks. The look is very sleek though."
3.0,"Dress is very short! I ordered a medium and I am 5'2"" & I would not be comfortable wearing this dress because of the length. I ordered the large for the extra length and it is too wide and still very short. Returning both. For reference, i am 5'2"" and 150lbs."
3.0,"It looked very nice off the package, a little cheap but still acceptable. Once washed the shirt is a MESS, faded, a lot of texture to it now not cute at all definitely going back. It’s too bad I liked it a lot"
3.0,Had to return these because too tight everywhere<br />Bunched up on legs !
3.0,Order 1-2 cup sizes bigger.
3.0,"It’s pretty and I love being able to buy sexy, unique bras w matching panties in a variety of styles that actually fit my 36f body. This bra seems to have a slightly narrow cup width for the volume of the cup, which is good for my narrower chest and shoulders but creates a slightly awkward shaping. Nonetheless I would have given the bra at least four stars, if not five, but for one feature. The back band narrows and closes with a SINGLE hook!!!  This is just horribly uncomfortable and compromises the support a lot. Add to that the fact that the elastic in the band is rigid and the edges poke into the skin. Ugh. I keep thinking if I could replace the back of the bra band, I’d probably wear this bra a lot more.  But for now, it just sits there in the drawer looking pretty next to all the boring Black and Nude grandma bras, and reminding me how much it sucks to be my size..."
3.0,Cute but the flowers came off after the first wash.
3.0,"I purchased the yellow in this dress and the color was indeed what I expected. It was gorgeous and I received a lot of compliments. However, the material is thin and somewhat plastic like. Also, I ordered the large and it was a bit small in the shoulder areas - I am 5ft 1 inch and 155lbs. Nonetheless, it is a lovely dress with great detailing barring the aforementioned negatives."
3.0,Works well and I really like the look of this watch but the band is cheap and one of the pieces that keeps the band in place broke the first day I wore it.
3.0,"I bought these during my peak running this summer and yikes, that inseam will NOT stay down (I have thighs that touch and rub no matter what when I run, so it's VERY important that I wear shorts whose inseams won't ride up my thighs). These were also surprisingly small even though I bought other colors from the same vendor of the same size that fit okay. Weird. They might be worth it to you if your thighs don't touch or can tolerate shorter inseams."
3.0,"The chain was much smaller than expected. It might help if W.C. showed some size comparison.I did decide to keep it as I did need a tiny chain for some pendants.The picture is a little deceiving though. Also, the clasp-ring is so little I will need to have a larger one put on so I am able to handle with my man size fingers. I must say,the lobster claw clasp is very nice. Now I know. I would indeed buy from WestCoast again,they carry very nice styles for us fellas."
3.0,One of the patches is upside down..  I guess that is what you get buying from China!  Otherwise the hat is nice.
3.0,"....I wear a 2XL in snug rash guards across all brands, this one fits the tightest.  Ordering a size up may make sense here."
3.0,but it didn't fit right
3.0,"Very well made, comfortable, easy to walk in heels. Based on a number of reviews stating these run small, I took their advice and ordered a half size up (I am normally an 8 and I ordered an 8.5). Unfortunately, the 8.5 were a smidge large on me. I am returning to reorder a size 8 so hopefully these will fit better. Great simple shoe for all occasions!<br /><br />Update: I REALLY wanted to love these shoes. Purely based on design, this is a well made simple shoe. However, the sizing is definitely a bit off. I am always a size 8 but based on reviews I ordered a half size up (8.5). The 8.5 was just a smidge too big (with the back of the shoe about half an inch off my heel). I was really hoping my true size would work (8) but unfortunately the 8 was a bit too snug for comfort. Majorly disappointed :(. This is why I changed by rating from 5 stars to 3."
3.0,There’s nothing compression about these tops. Just a nice singlet to relearn to the gym and that’s it.
3.0,"Cute, good price but only fits one pair of sunglasses"
3.0,Smaller than expected. Broke very quickly. Silver faded to copper.
3.0,like it but runs a little small
3.0,Made of plastic like material ( top part) . Makes it hot to wear wven though theres tiny holes on top of hat.
3.0,"The shorts are cute for their own sake, but they are nothing like the picture. The material isn’t soft enough to be drapey like in the picture and the color is not even close. If you’re looking for a cute pair of comfy, canvas style shorts, these are for you. If you’re looking for the shorts in the picture, pass. I do not want periwinkle blue shorts, so I will be returning them unfortunately. They’re pretty okay otherwise."
3.0,The hat that was shown said Veteran across the back but when mine came it said U.S. ARMY. I was looking for the one saying Veteran.
3.0,Ok 18k it look's fake but it got here on time but it looks yellow ! a 3 Is what I will give it
3.0,"Es hermosa, muy buena tela, pero corren pequeños, yo soy M y pedí L y casi no me Sierra el busto, pero es tan hermosa que me la quedé y agregare una blusa debajo para cubrir mi sosten😘😘😘"
3.0,I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THERE DALLAS.  I only wear them around the house so it's ok for what I wanted
3.0,"I gave this product 3 stars because I have only had it a short period of time and the color has completely dulled. -I had ordered the lavender and it is now a very faint version of what it once was. I have only had this ring for 2 and a half weeks.. very disappointed in the color quality.<br />The ring itself is comfortable to wear and fits perfectly. I am a size 4.5 but ordered a 4 because there are no half sizes.<br />With the color fading quickly, I can only wonder how long this ring will actually last... we shall see..."
3.0,"These would have been nice, had all three been consistent on size.  One fit great all around, one fit great in the back but not the front, and one didn't fit at all.  Nice material though."
3.0,Pulls on your arm hair. Very cute but at times uncomfortable
3.0,Purchased these for my granddaughters 8th birthday party. You get entire sets for every bracelet. They are so cute ! The downsize is they break easily.
3.0,"I love the beanie, I believe the quality is very nice. The quality of the mask is very nice as well however mine came a little deformed and didn’t seem big enough to comfortably cover my mouth and nose. I feel like if my chin was covered my nose was not and Vice versa. However the quality of the beanie is great"
3.0,The fit is strange.
3.0,The size is a bit too big on me and the fabric is thin and transparent. The color is also a bit pale and not as saturated as the image shows. I ordered the yellow dress.
3.0,"Not bad, but looks cheap"
3.0,Color is off it's not pink and aqua BUT red and green....husband joked it looks like Christmas. LOL.  The cut is okay a bit boxy cotton fabric is light breathable I'm a bit short normal weight.  Tunic falls not to low hip or thigh but higher like just below the waist so for you tall gals maybe not tunic-like.  I ordered medium.  Sequins are cool embroidery too if it's all hand-made it's probably a good buy at $55.  But again because it's not WOVEN it's printed cotton so it looks cheap.
3.0,"This cardigan is super cute and the fabric itself is nice however, I snapped the top snap and then when I went to unsnap it (not tugging on the fabric) it pulled out of the fabric.  Still a cute sweater - just will have to reinforce the snaps."
3.0,"I like the colors, However, it is not like sweatshirt material at all it more like those polyester pants your grandmother wore. It looks extremely cheap"
3.0,I’ve bought before and they fit perfect these were cut slightly smaller and are a little more tight/snug than I would like
3.0,"The style of the dress is adorable. However, I packed this for a European vacation and it was a wrinkled mess. The wrinkles come back as soon as you have ironed. Also, this dress requires a slip because the material is thin. It fit as expected but I would line dry to minimize shrinking."
3.0,"Spent many hours searching for a good but moderately-priced pair o' slippers on many websites.<br /><br />Wanted a lightweight pair for inside the house during summer, so I didn't want faux wool or Thinsulate.<br />And I planned to wear them with ankle socks I could wash because I didn't want them getting funky from bare feet.<br />That's worked out although some days it's been too warm for socks so I went barefoot.<br /><br />I have a new apt. with smooth vinyl laminate flooring throughout, so I wanted non-skid soles as well.<br />Well, these are definitely not slip-resistant but I haven't fallen...yet.<br /><br />I wear a 12 shoe and order 12 slippers. They're probably a bit large, but the next size down would have been too small.<br /><br />They look nice and so far there's no structural issues.<br /><br />The only issue thus far is that in just two weeks the right slipper developed a lump in the footbed.<br />It seems that underneath the plaid liner the cushioning has sorta balled up under my arch.<br />So it feels like there's something in my slipper and it's slightly annoying. I requested a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Thought about ordering another pair since these have such good reviews and I didn't see anyone else report this problem.<br />But Amazon advised I should buy something else.<br /><br />I'm still wearing them because I threw out my old ones and haven't yet forced myself to sit down and start searching again."
3.0,"Sheds ALOT! cute but for the price i exspect better quality, lots of compliments"
3.0,"item is odd in its sizing. the length in center back is correct at about 31"",  however, the front is significantly shorter than the back, at 26"".  That over 5"" difference equates to an odd fit when buttoned. Typical button up shirts have a difference front to back length of 1.5-2.5"". Pic shows coofandy shirt properly sized front and back(tan), blue shirt very short in front. Improperly tailored."
3.0,The handle broke after a few weeks.
3.0,Broke after about a month
3.0,Hoodie was short in length and wide at width
3.0,This shoe is very wide therefore making walking difficult.  Takes effort to keep them on your feet.  Trying to give them away.
3.0,Does not have full protection from sun rays. Good sunglass that will not fall apart.
3.0,",Like the shirt wayyyyy small order up 2 sizes"
3.0,"I love this headpiecebut the only thing that bothered me was it kept hurting my forehead. The metal press against your forehead and it left a mark, I had to keep adjusting it and taking it off. Other than that it is a great quality material but it kept hurting my forehead."
3.0,These frames help keep your mask off your nose and mouth directly but do get moist and need to be removed and cleaned to be comfortable. When wearing masks for a long time they help not feeling smothered.
3.0,"Although, this mask is beautiful, its super uncomfortable to wear! The gems and metal pointy backs that dig into your face and hurt like hell (especially the one between the eyes). This can be fixed with a dab of hot glue, but still inconvenient. I couldn't imagine wearing this for more than five minutes for a quick photo."
3.0,"We used these as party favors. They’re fun and a good size for adults. Allow yourself some time and patience to get them apart/unstacked. We ordered 2 packages and none were damaged. They’re not high quality, but they’re a decent value and worked well for us."
3.0,Very cheaply made but is very cute on
3.0,Fabric seems a little cheap.
3.0,Looks cute. Very thin plastic cover.
3.0,"Awesome, flattering, sexy but still modest enough to wear around my children...the only issue is that the heart in the back didn't stay up. I pinned it to my hair but still had issues with it staying up all night. Overall not a bad costume, though. Got tons of compliments! I just wish it would've stayed in place without having to mess with it!!!"
3.0,The dress is lovely. Unfortunately size runs too small. Ordered a medium but fits like a size small. If you're considering it buy a size bigger. Plus dress above knee.
3.0,"This is running small, I ordered the xl and I’m size 16 womens, 5’8 40G and 200 lbs. fit more as a 12-14 for the xl.<br />It’s ok enough fabric and construction is pretty good. Just too small."
3.0,"I feel like this shirt looks like scrubs when on. (Which is fine, but not for business attire."
3.0,It wasn’t the material I thought it would be it’s more silky but still super comfy & fits great!
3.0,XL was way too small. I am 5’7” 172 pounds. They are well made and also have and extra cool pocket in the back for something as big as your ID. So tight they hardly fit over the heel of my foot.
3.0,Kind of heavy and awkward to have over the shoulder. Length is too long
3.0,Its really a very large on the face
3.0,"This t-shirt gets high marks for quality as it's very well made.  Substantial cotton fabric, and well sewn.  Only issue is the color, which is way off the Cub's royal blue.  The shirt was so dark, it was difficult to read the logo, so I opted to return it."
3.0,This is what I want and I usually wear small or medium and the medium was way too tight.
3.0,Beautiful shirt but runs really small.
3.0,They fit right and are comfortable. Once you wash them even on gentle cycle the padding shifts and I’d difficult to put back into place.
3.0,"They are cute, but give me wedgies"
3.0,I hate when an underwear has too large and long of a &#34;V&#34; also the cut makes the band go square across the butt making the butt look squarish and not round. Also kinda a spandex material... not terrible but they could do better.
3.0,Not really what I expected and definitely not as colorful
3.0,It's got the thickness of braided 550 cord. And Iya kinda short so it would be tight on the thicker necks!
3.0,"This bracelet, at least the one I received, looks pretty much like what the picture looks like. It's a rose quartz stone set in a gold looking setting on a gold chain. The stone looks more natural, not shaped but set as it may be found in nature. The chain doesn't seem to be of very high quality so it doesn't look all that great if you are wearing something on the nicer side. The clasp is shaped like the letter S and is slightly tricky to get but once you do it seems to be pretty firmly in there. The hard part is trying to slip it in without bending it or bending it too much because once you start bending it the little bit of metal will weaken once it breaks it'll be a mess to get the bracelet to stay on.<br />If you like what you see in the picture and you really like it, then you should like it. However, it does look a little on the lower end of the jewelry scale so keep that in mind. I really like the rose quartz part of it. It's a very pretty stone. It's definitely the best things about this bracelet."
3.0,"It's nice but looks a little bit cheaper than on the picture. But the worst thing is that it stinks. I understand that it's the glue that holds the stones on it, but l owe it for about 2 weeks and still wasn't able to wear it because of the smell."
3.0,they're somewhat hard to keep on little one's feet.
3.0,Tight fit and heavy material. Seemed fairly well made
3.0,It is very tight on your head.  It is a great value for the money.  Screen scratches very easily.  But it is inexpensive.
3.0,I have high arches. The straps are not long enough nor are there enough holes fir the buckle. Not as good as my old ones in that respect.<br />But I git the pink and they are very cute!
3.0,Very cute but my chain was very weak and links snapped off!
3.0,It does what advertises
3.0,"super cute and comfy pants, how ever I had to wear spanx bottoms with them because they are a little see threw during certain sunlight."
3.0,"The septum is smaller than it looks and started rubbing the corner of my nose raw. It got really painful and I couldn’t wear it. It looks exactly as advertised, but it’s to small."
3.0,Bought as a gift. The person I gave it to said it said she needs a little effort pushing it back after closing.
3.0,I like the earrings and they show up and look good on but the stones are not great. One has some blue flashes. I would rate better if stoned were better. I enjoy wearing the earrings.
3.0,Xl fit like a medium
3.0,"Looks good, at first. But already at clasp, black paint is wearing off. For this price, however, I am not left feeling overly dissatisfied."
3.0,Like the length but is tight
3.0,Cuts weren't clean. Not as nice around the neck and under the shoulders.
3.0,"Bought in march, finish is fading."
3.0,Hard to read what the charm actually says.  It's still cute.
3.0,oky
3.0,"My son loves how soft these are, but often find it wet inside after playing out In The snow, even though they have been fastened and his snow pants are covering them. We don’t get a ton of snow, but if we did I’d buy something else."
3.0,When worn can’t really tell they are hearts.
3.0,Sizing not consistent.<br />Sweatshirt sized correctly; tee shirt way too big.
3.0,I was hoping this vest would be softer. Unfortunately  it feels crispy like fiberglass. The zipper  is really poor quality  too. It's  cute but not sure I will keep it.
3.0,fits more like a nightgown
3.0,Nice cap. Sits lower on your head than baseball hats with higher crowns.
3.0,Cute dress but was too small.
3.0,"It’s not as the picture description. It’s definitely cheap material. Very short, can’t wear it as a dress."
3.0,Decent looking but not for long term use
3.0,I love the fabric and quality but they run too small for me to wear them :( I gave them away to a family member.
3.0,"Is a nice blanket, but feels cheep. Not as thick as I would have liked. Bought to use outdoors, in grass and such. Good size for 2."
3.0,"These are very cute and warm although they are not the correct size. I’m short (5’0) so I thought these might fit ok regardless of being a child size but they hit about mid-calf on me. I can somewhat take the blame for this, as I didn’t realize they were specifically a girl size, but they are VERY small"
3.0,The maroon was not maroon.
3.0,Not true to size. I ordered a medium but was very tight. However I liked the cut and comfort and will exchange for a large.
3.0,Very small kind of thin
3.0,These are big. The packaging says it's for size 9-11! That's not what the Amazon description says. I was going to return them but I ended up putting them on over another pair of thick socks while lounging at home. I was freezing & they kept my feet warm. Wish they were my actual size so I could wear them normally.
3.0,"It could be half the size.... It's extremely large. I literally felt like I had tossed a throw blanket on me. I had to return it. I just couldn't make it work. Other than that, it's soft and cute, just way too big for me."
3.0,The material on the beige with flowers print felt like old fashioned drapes material ☹️
3.0,Little tight on the side of my face.
3.0,I was hoping they would be more spacious to fit all my hair. But they are still decent caps!
3.0,The lock keeps coming unlocked.
3.0,It has a nice fit. However I have not had it that long and the thread has been coming apart on the inside of the Mask.<br />Other than that I have enjoyed this product
3.0,"So the band itself is nice, but the little grey bars to connect it to the fitbit come separate from the band fabric, which made changing the band a pain in the neck. It took 2 of us almost 20 minutes (and a lot of finger cramps) and we finally got them. Nice fit and fabric looks to be good quality. Comfortable too"
3.0,It worked great for a while. Then the Pin would pop out of the end occasionally. The brackets got pretty funky at one point. Finally it broke beyond repair. Tactical looking but not as sturdy
3.0,"These are nice, on the heavier side, but unfortunately after my daughter wore them for a day they turned her fingers green 🤦‍♀️"
3.0,"This is a comfortable shoe, it is a little flat, with more arch support it would a great shoe"
3.0,"There is nothing large about this bag.<br />Short strap, small opening.<br />Very disappointed to say the least.."
3.0,"theyre good earrings, but the wrong colors came. i received two greens and random colors, but still really good earrings"
3.0,For the price good quality
3.0,"Mostly the watch is good. My bad, I didn't realize how big the face was. I could always hang the watch on the wall and call it a clock!"
3.0,This item fits too small and I had to return it.
3.0,"Despite there being the option to pick different colors, we were sent a different set that what my son picked out, and he was disappointed. Besides that, they’re very comfortable and a good fit, true to size."
3.0,"I have at least 10 pairs of Lucky Brand Denim. They always fit me. I have two pairs of the Sienna Slim Boyfriend. This pair, that says it is Elsie dark wash, is not the same cut at all. The waste is high not mid and the length is at least 2 inches shorter. Makes me sad because this was the only place I could find the Sienna in a darker wash."
3.0,"I like the looks of it, but it feels flimsy. I was going to return it because it didn't feel very secure on my wrist and it actually did fall off the first time I wore it; however, when I tried to return it I got a message that it was not eligible for return. I'm not sure why. So I couldn't return it and now I do wear it from time to time, but I have to wear it up a little higher and it still feels a bit flimsy."
3.0,"Sweater is great. However, the stitch on the pockets were poorly done. One of the pockets stitch opened up after one wear. Otherwise, I would’ve given a higher rating."
3.0,Very nice just too small to even put a walletbin
3.0,Eh. Not digital or LED so it isn't bright or usable in the dark. It's decently built though.
3.0,"I’m usually a size 14 and thought this could work, but it’s too low cut and too short when wrapped. It will make a good robe or coverall around the house but that’s it. This is why I’m wary of ordering clothes in Amazon the sizing is all over the place."
3.0,"The first ones I ordered last year have adjustable brows, the new ones don’t?  I would have given them 5 stars if I was be able to adjust the brow pieces."
3.0,Gave 3 stars because it says kids mask but it’s definitely for an adult it was huge.
3.0,Material not what I expected...
3.0,For the size I bought the shoulders were tight.  I wish I had gone up a size.
3.0,Love the pattern but was really hoping this would fit better. It's just too short. I don't think ordering a larger size would have changed that very much.
3.0,Cool concept. But the amount of energy to open the cap is the same as pulling the mask down
3.0,"We ordered a small and it fits like a large. baggy in the chest and waist area, arms are ok. The string lacing in the front was not as shown in the picture but more of a conservative knock off. The plunge is equivalent to a 2nd button from top.<br /><br />Good part is that it is decent fabric and will keep you warm."
3.0,"Good quality but much, much smaller than the sizing indicates."
3.0,"These have an odd waistband elastic that is not the full size of the waistband. the elastic is very firm in the waist. I am a size 00 and ordered an XS. The waistband is tight but the rest of the fabric is somewhat loose. I am a seamstress so I am going to redo the elastic waist. The fabric is nice. Lightweight, soft, and doesn't pill."
3.0,"Like the colors in this necklace, very cute."
3.0,"Super cute picture and colors, but why so wide?  Can fit two people in the width"
3.0,"top was nice, bottoms were way too small -not marked right"
3.0,I was disappointed in the clasp size.  I thought the lobster clasp would be larger.  It is difficult to attach.
3.0,Bigger than I thought. Material and quality is good.
3.0,"I wish there had been instructions of how to stretch the rubber to go further up the glasses closer to the ear.  I can only squeeze them on so they stay on but when I lean back against a couch or chair, they push forward.  Any ideas?  Can I heat them in microwave or something????"
3.0,"Super cute, but sheds everywhere!"
3.0,My daughter ordered this dress and it was huge on her. She's ordered a small. It fits me and I'm a large. I liked it well enough and decided to keep it for me.
3.0,"These socks do what they are supposed to do and are pretty comfortable.  They are a bit of a workout yo put on though even following the directions.  ( you’ll never make it otherwise.). I wasn’t sure which size to get, so I got from large/ex large up to 4x/5x.  Good thing they were pretty cheap because only the largest would fit, and I could have gone even bigger if they’d made it.  People who can bend down easily will do better but it was difficult for me and I’m not sure if my wife is strong enough to do it for me.  I ended tearing one sock where I was holding up near the top, but not so bad it wouldn’t work.  I know to be very careful next time.  I have never had any sock tear like that even trying to put on shorter compression socks.  It wasn’t like I used that much force. It was just localized where my thumb grasped the material."
3.0,Not a big fan of the seam that runs through the middle of the front. Otherwise it’s cute enough. Looks a bit cheap.
3.0,it's beautiful but the necklace breaks easy
3.0,"Fit, but too thin. Doesn't stay well."
3.0,I like it the dress but the color as not expected.
3.0,Pretty difficult to put together. The original band had been glued in near the face of the band.
3.0,"Fits snug around the ribs but gaps open under the arms, as if it were just cut wrong."
3.0,"I love the careful cut of this dress, the fabric, the color. BUT, the waist sits too high*: it makes it look like a woman-sized girl's dress because the waist is higher than the natural waist but not high enough to look intentional, so it just looks like it is a dress made for a little girl.<br />If it had had another, say, 3 or 4 inches of fabric across the ribs to make it longer, I would buy this dress in every color. As it is, I am returning it.<br /><br />*I am quite busty (30I) and if you are of a different shape you may not have this problem at all and should definitely go for it. If you are a chesty gal I would keep looking (even if you are short torso or have short shoulders-- I am both and the waist just doesn't sit in a flattering place)."
3.0,"It looks like the photo, but definitely not sweatshirt material. The fabric is thin, you'll need to wear something under it."
3.0,I like the style and it looks like it will be warm. However I have rated this 3 stars because you can see dried glue sticking out from the rhinestones which is not attractive and also makes me wonder how long it will take for them to come off since they are glued on.
3.0,"These fit well, but don't wear them without a long shirt....they're see-through in bright lighting."
3.0,I was disappointed in the stone itself.  There were no striations as shown in the photo.  The stone was an attractive solid color bright green but did not look like malachite.
3.0,"This is a very attractive watch but the clasp on the strap was to difficult for an old guy like me. Disappointed because I liked the watch, but I sent it back."
3.0,You can see through the material. The black one is fantastic though.
3.0,Very very thin material. Not to be used for warmth but more for looks. Length is perfect and I'm 5'5.
3.0,get what you pay for although it does look nice
3.0,NEED TO ORDER A SIZE BIGGER .  VERY CUTE
3.0,Hard to understand as you continue each day.
3.0,Cute charm. Chain is much thinner than expected
3.0,"Fit was smaller than 2t3t Disney panties, but still bigger than I was hoping.  My 2 year old daughter wears size 18 month clothes and size 1-2 was still too big for her."
3.0,i love the design but it is REALLY small. i normally wear a small and would consider a large even over a medium. i have not received a replacement though- just returned.
3.0,Works well with black jacket of same material.
3.0,I don’t like how it look on me!!!! It’s a okay look! Easy to wear! Have to create a look for it….
3.0,It is very low quality.  The pattern is similar as what is shown.  The fabric is of a cheap fleece blanket.  And are the edges are not fringed they are just loop stitched(?).  Overall the product looks very cheap.  On the plus side it is warm and practical(if you don’t care what it looks like).
3.0,Expensive but received well as a gift.
3.0,Used size chart before I purchased but was WAY too small
3.0,For the price it’s a great accent piece. The earrings fell apart the second time I wore them .
3.0,"I don’t know why, but my 20 month old daughter won’t wear these shoes. Not sure if it’s because they are uncomfortable or too heavy. There is also a strap in the back that goes around the heel that is not shown in the picture, that she doesn’t like. I tried for a month to get her to wear them. Finally gave up and just donated them. Cute shoes, but only gave 3 Stars, because if I would have known it had straps, I would have never purchased them."
3.0,"The chain is thick, like way big for this small swan, it is cute, but it in fact really small like mm small"
3.0,Unicorn Purse was a gift for my niece she loved it.
3.0,"Very cute - color was a little more dull in person than in the picture. Also fit a little small. The sleeves were too short and it was awkwardly short in the back - I realize that's the style of the sweater, where it drapes longer in the front, but the back went up higher than I prefer with that style. I sent it back for a size up. I'm 5'9&#34;, athletic build and usually wear a M so I would get it in a L."
3.0,The dress was beautiful and it was $6. It didn’t fit me. It will fit someone who wears 1x/2x perfectly. Gave it to a coworker and she loved it.
3.0,"I like the style but the sizing is way off, I normally wear a LG in women's tops but this shirt is more like a 2X....just a heads up,  I gave the shirt to my daughter."
3.0,"This product is exactly like it says in the description. The watch itself works fine. I got it for my 12 yr. daughter as a birthday present and the second time she wore it the pin that connects the band to the watch  fell out but, it was an easy fix. Overall the watch work and she likes it."
3.0,Thank you for offering to send me replacement socks that are not as tight.  If it is possible I would like to compare the two to see if one reduces my post-surgical swelling any better than the other.  I appreciate your attention to my comments.  Always a great way to promote good products.
3.0,I thought that it would fit my phone but the slot is too small. I would have sent it back but I had already removed the tags before putting my phone in. I don't like the slots they have for putting your cards in. Order a bigger case not the cheaper price.
3.0,"I’m not particularly busty (38C) and followed this sizing chart- absolutely could not get it buttoned over my chest without a bra on- can’t imagine how that would’ve gone over with a bra. 100% size up if you at all have a chest. Would be cute as an over shirt for tank tops but not what I purchased for, returning but might repurchase as the shirt itself was very cute."
3.0,these run large and not very stylish.  front rounded toe but they are waterproof and will serve the purpose well.
3.0,"This is a very nice simple watch great features nice small face BUT the wristband is NOT for the average adult size wrist.  The wristband is small and will only fit a small adult wrist or a child's wrist.  I will keep the watch, but I will have to take it to the jewelers to have a longer wristband attached to the watch."
3.0,Very long! Scrunch butt wasn't very scrunched.
3.0,"Although our daughter loves how they looked, the soles were very slippery and within minutes of putting them on she slipped and fell."
3.0,"The color is absolutely gorgeous, but the size runs small. I normally wear XL and got XXL so that it would be roomy and it’s very snug. You may want to size up."
3.0,I like this jacket however it doesn’t have any tagging or wash instructions or sizing included:.. very disappointing
3.0,"The material seems to be nice, the sole is a harder, thicker rubber, but wow!!  These are literally half the men's size.  I typically wear an 11 or 12, ordered the 12/13 size.  Pretty sure these are supposed to be womens slippers."
3.0,"Fit was great, but did not have different color lining."
3.0,"If you're a C36, this will not fit you. If you're probably B34-B36 , the fit for it might be just right. It didn't work out for me but it worked out for someone else that I know so it's okay."
3.0,"This is a durable bag, a cut above what you get at discount outlets. It is IMHO overpriced."
3.0,Nice and a lot smaller than expected.  Between the size of a nickle and a quarter.
3.0,"Love the print and colors , runs a little big"
3.0,"Pretty design, though the band scratches easily. My ring looks much older than it is."
3.0,Good material but the hat was huge even with tying it how it said
3.0,"I weigh about 200 pounds,  I'm 5""2'. I usually wear a size 18.  This dress is not for some who has large bust, hips and stomach. I tried to show my arm, but it was hard taking the picture. The dress has some stretch, but not enough.  The collar of the dress is made cheaply. . I'm returning it.  I really like the dress online, even bought shoes to match.  I will be returning both."
3.0,Many pockets / storage. A bit on the larger side which isn’t bad. Reason for my rating is that I don’t feel the quality is worth what I paid for it.
3.0,"We have an EMF meters and other tools also. We tested that hat. It blocks only magnetic field and does almost nothing for electric field. Please keep that in mind.<br /><br />Recommendation: Keep your phone 1 meter away from you and talk on speaker only! ( if you want to be healthy). it is much safer to be 2-3 meters away from your phone. Do NOT use your phone in the car, it is like microwaving yourself in the metal box, turn it OFF in the car. Control your kids with using phones!!!<br />Turn it off for the night time and do not keep it in your bedroom. Turn off your internet modem EVERY time you do not use internet and turn off  modem for night also. Keep your internet modem far away from the area you spend your time at home the most.<br />The AMF meter is showing RED and makes a noise when we put him next to the phone. All cell phones receive signals from antennas every 8 seconds. every 8 seconds it is highly dangerous to keep in next to you.<br /><br />Stay healthy everyone!"
3.0,"These were disappointing. The color saturation is poor. I am keeping since the nine dollars  cost is low enough for the one shirt they match, but I doubt they will get much wear. I won't re-gift them simply because the color is so pale."
3.0,"A nice pin, but without a firm backing it’s easily lost - mine lasted one week"
3.0,The handle started ripping after a week worth of using to the beach. You really do get what you pay for.
3.0,"its not as long as i thought, but my mom liked it(Mother's day gift)"
3.0,To wear the hat I have to use it on the very last button or else it wont fit. This is not ideal as it moves around. Be careful with hat sizing if purchasing this. Still works and gets the job done but very small
3.0,"Fit really good through my chest, but across my hips is a little snugger then I like. Though it doesn't creep up."
3.0,"Black cuffs they are very small in size verses a standard size cuff length.. Like the color,,"
3.0,"It's prettier in the picture, but it's ok for the price."
3.0,They are not UFOs but they are still rad. Comfy but should be more comfy. The price is awesome. I can't tell if I want another pair right now or if I should just hold off a quick min and spend some more for the real deal UFOs. I like their logo and brand name.
3.0,These were notnwjat inthough they were
3.0,One of the posts fell out immediately. Won't stay in.
3.0,34B for reference and if there was an XSmall I would’ve liked it better.
3.0,"Small, well made but not very useful as it has an even smaller opening. Iphone 6 barely fits"
3.0,"Pretty cheap, but if you take care of them they're super cute"
3.0,"I purchased this watch winder for winding my Seiko watch, but it won't wind it. It will wind my Invicta watch though.<br />So if you have a Seiko, don't count it it working.<br />I have purchased alot of items from Amazon and found that most of the things were of poor quality, or just plain junk."
3.0,Size is not accurate.  Small
3.0,The belt is of decent quality.  Its a good thick durable belt.  The only issue I have is you have to take the buckle off every time you want to reverse it from black to brown or vice versa.  That is an inconvenience.  All of the other reversible belts I have the buckle just flips over.  I would rather buy two belts than have to stick a screwdriver in the buckle every time I want to reverse it.  Other than that the belt would be a 4-5 star.
3.0,Sizing larger than stated
3.0,"I have other high waisted shorts and I was hoping these will be a bit similar but they were not.<br /><br />These are super long, not like on the picture more like a bit above your knees. And even though I went with my usual size, these were just too snug around my but. They do stretch but I was looking for a looser fit.<br /><br />They also have an under layer that is white, which would be fine if it did not show. You can easily see the under layer lines through and it does not look flattering at all.<br /><br />I would say go with a different brand or style."
3.0,"So shocked that this vneck yellow same size as white top I have is way bigger! It’s beautiful color yellow! Material is soft, like the white shirt. About the same thickness, it is not, thin almost see through. I love the white curved neck tank top from same company same page just whole lot larger & longer than I like. Happily, I could wear size smaller, but I gave it to someone that can fit. Looks good on her and she likes it.<br />Since I like the Sampee brands I will stick with curved tanks, I think I already ordered navy & coral, hope I ordered the tanks. Haha!<br />These are cute tops at good price and will continue to order."
3.0,The shirt is comfortable but the workmanship is shoddy. Fabric was cut in places and wasn't finished off properly. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,Doesn’t glow in dark.
3.0,Love this bracelets for the price you can't go wrong. But I hate how the knot is showing. It's very disappointing.
3.0,It’s a beautiful necklace but the chain twist quiet easily other than that I’m happy.
3.0,It's really top big that there was too much fabric to convert my size D cups and would ultimately go too low and my whole bra would show.<br />I got the blue with white flower pattern. It's a little to showy for my taste.
3.0,Cheaply Manufactured
3.0,I have requested a refund on this shirt.  The fabric was polyester no cotton very flimsy.  Not at all what I expected.  Please make sure to read all of the description before you purchase.  I have to send it back at our cost which according to the post office will be almost the same price as the shirt.
3.0,Not leather but what do you expect at a price like rhay
3.0,"if is a fitted elastic shirt, calling it compression is a little to much"
3.0,I bought this item in XL though I normally wear a size Large. Despite ordering 1 size up to accommodate the shrinking this was still not as &#34;Flowy&#34; as expected. Also it also does not hang off the shoulder at all.
3.0,"I ordered a size that had one inch extra room in each place but when I got them, the waist is 2 inches too big and the leg holes are fitted tight. They’re still wearable but are not my favs. Also the legs roll up and wrinkle so you have to iron them every wash."
3.0,This dress would’ve been really nice if it fit properly. I could probably squeeze into it but it’s not comfortable since the sizing is a little small. The material is also very thin.
3.0,"These shirts are a nice material for exercising, however they are not tight, as you would expect a compression shirt to be."
3.0,"Great Hoop earrings!!!! I have the 3 cm ones and are amazing but I ordered the 2 cm ones, and they are very small, not 2 cm in diameter as are advertised so I gave them to my 4 years niece."
3.0,Seems to work good. But it comes with absolutely no kind of instructions. Good luck figuring out how to use it. NO GUARANTEE
3.0,"I bought these to replace a pair of shoelaces for a pair of low top sneakers. 27 inches sounded long, but once I laced the shoes up there wasn't a whole lot of lace left to tie the shoes. That's my fault for not measuring the old laces I was replacing. Before you buy, be certain 27 inches is long enough for your shoes."
3.0,fits good! but missing straps! Please send.
3.0,"Coverage is fine, but causes my neck to get hot and sweat a bunch..."
3.0,"They look cute as heck but it’s a little difficult to keep the top hook around the top of your ear. ESP with long hair. Deff a hair up kinda thing, still a little challenging either way."
3.0,The sizes run small... Order one size larger than you're usually comfortable in.
3.0,Very soft but too small.
3.0,"The dress is very cute. I had problem with the zipper. It hit stuck by my waist. I had to invest in a new zipper since it got stuck and when it went up, got open!"
3.0,"I'm gonna start this review off by mentioning one big thing. I really REALLY don't like the texture for the leather. In my opinion it seems very tacky and cheap. Now it feels just fine, and the magnetic clasp makes adjusting the size so easy. The color won't go with every watch, so keep color in mind when you pick one out. The biggest reason to choose this over the apple branded version is simple. Price. Apple is charging an arm and two legs for apple watch accessories. Many, like myself, don't feel like spending the big bucks for something when an alternative can be found much cheaper. This is one of those situations where the compromise between price and quality leans a little bit over to the price side. Its cheaper, so you must be willing to accept a drop in quality. Honestly this is still a fantastic band, and if I had gotten it in black I may rate it higher. But in blue its okay, just okay.<br /><br />I was given this product for review."
3.0,Super nice dress I would just suggest order a side up
3.0,Totally worked for me. Material is a little thin but that's my only complaint
3.0,"I got these as a gift for my boyfriend who had asked for &#34;fun socks&#34;. I got these and sadly was very disappointed.<br /><br />Firstly, although I cannot point you to the set I bought - it seems to no longer be offered - the images show three of the 8 pairs with what looks like red. In reality it is bright pink. The boyfriend likes pink but doesn't want to wear it. I know monitors can show different things to different users but a bunch of pink socks when not expecting them is a disappointment.<br /><br />Secondly, I bought socks that fit mens shoes sizes 7-12. The socks looked a little on the small side but okay. Then I washed them on cold and tumbled on low heat with a moisture sensor. I am very careful with clothes to keep them nicer for longer, but these socks shrank BIG TIME. These men's shoe size 7-12 do not fit my bf, who wears a 10.5-11. They fit me. I mean perfectly fit me without a stitch of bagginess or extra give. I wear a boy's size 5.5.<br /><br />So, basically I now have a bunch of socks I wouldn't have picked for me. A bunch of pink men's patterned socks. Oh well, I guess I can wear them around the house and not care about padding outside in them when it's cold to do laundry in the garage or get the dogs inside.<br /><br />The quality - aside from the radical shrinking and color inaccuracy is pretty nice. The socks are well sewn - or knitted? - and haven't fallen apart or give the impression that they will do so. The patterns are well-rendered. Just don't bank on these being men's sized socks. And if they don't look really big enough - like maybe too big - don't wash them - return them. I should have done this, but alas, I wasn't thinking they would shrink so darned badly. Oh well. You live and learn.<br /><br />Note: I've added some pics of my 5.5 size (that's the size I fit in boys - I am a ladies size 7.5) next to my boyfriend's boot that is under the size of the largest size these socks are supposed to fit by 1- 1.5 sizes (he wears mens 10.5 or 11 depending) to show the size issue and another close up to show how perfectly snug and comfy these are on my comparatively little feet. Hope this helps and best of luck, all!"
3.0,"They look good on and don't irritate my skin at all.  They were difficult to put on, and I have not attempted to take them out yet. They are very thin and I wonder how badly they will bend when I take them out."
3.0,"Not true Navy blue, more of a purple instead.  I will keep it since I was considering getting a purple top anyway.  It doesn't match any of my navy blue figured skirts, too purple."
3.0,"Super disappointed! It's great that it's leather but the studs are only around the back of the belt when I'm wearing it. I wanted one that was studded all the way around. I'm glad it was only $10, so I won't be returning it but definitely not what I expected or what I was looking for. I'll just stick with a 2 for $20 deal at Spencer's instead- even if they are plastic. At least they're fully studded.<br /><br />Edit 12/21/2017- So... it turns out it isn't leather either."
3.0,The chain was not long enough or good enough quality.
3.0,"These are okay. They took forever to arrive, longer than the specified time. The fabric is a thin polyester (2 ply) and not super high quality. The prints are as bright as pictured, they look cute on my petite girls, ages 9-13, and they do fit well. Overall I'd recommend them if you are really, really not in a rush and don't mind the thinner fabric."
3.0,Nice bright colors. The material is very thin and not stiched well.
3.0,"It holds onto my AirPods well, so I have no fear of them slipping off the holders.  But the magnet that holds them together to keep it closed around your neck is rather week, and I’m concerned the necklace will slip off my neck if it comes undone.  Otherwise, it is attractive, but not as safe to use when I’m out as I’d hoped."
3.0,The side w/the stars is way longer than the side w/the stripes. It is obvious in this picture but even more so obvious in person.
3.0,"Quite large, and very opaque. Otherwise serviceable."
3.0,"Very smooth on the outside but rough and itchy on the inside. Other than that, it's beautiful, I love the buttons and the colors.<br />I might return it my skin is weak."
3.0,"what can I say  u get what u pay for.  It works , looks good. will last if you use it carefully"
3.0,This ring is much smaller than what I expected.  The opal is nice but the opal and the cristal on the sides are too small for my taste.  It is a bit hard to tell what it is unless you look close.
3.0,I returned this product..I ordered the correct size per the size chart. The top was shorter than what I wanted ( did not cover my mid section like the photo shows )
3.0,"Received them this time, the first time I didn't."
3.0,Exactly as pictured. Easy to put together. Only downfall is it doesnt really fit my wrist. You can take the links off to adjust it to be bigger or smaller and my wrist is in between the sizes.
3.0,Be careful as these are pretty budget looking cuff links. They work for me but might not for all if you are looking for something a little classier.
3.0,"It was exactly as described, just to small to be used. I wear a size 13 boot  and the arm to hook the boot are to narrow to really be helpful. Just all around to small."
3.0,Item came in a plastic bag. No paper item description of any kind and no hair ties which are suppose to be included. Daughter is happy about item but if I do not get a complete costume I will be returning.
3.0,Nice gown but way too small size way off
3.0,"Cute, but not the greatest quality. You get what you pay for but I'm not complaining. It works. 36DDD, bought an XL. A little shorter than I'd like, but it's okay."
3.0,It seems as if it were designed for someone with very long thick hair. The crown part is too big and bulky.  I was able to roll the back of the hat down to flatten the top a little
3.0,"The only reason I got this set was because it said it is stainless steal. Stainless steal doesn't change color. This set is not stainless steel. I only wore it for about a week and my neck was green and my bracelet is faded. Me and my boyfriend are disappointed... so now we have to buy another set! Other than the fact its 100% fake, its a really pretty set! Waste of money."
3.0,"Love everything about it,  from the comfort, colors are true, and it is true to size. I'm 4'11 and size Medium, 130 lbs.<br />The only downfall is that in just about 1 week, the black one tore right where the inner seam is on my left calf.<br />I didn't get a chance to wear it to the gym yet. 😔"
3.0,"Jacket seemed well made, it was just extremely short. I'm only 5'9&#34; and it was way way too short. Had to pay ridiculous return shipping. They did refund my purchase price, hence the 3 stars"
3.0,Hook to hold chain broke after couple days otherwise it was nice watch.
3.0,Very Nice... Thanks
3.0,"Loved these leggings... At first.<br /><br />After wearing maybe 10 times, these ripped in the crotch area while I was wearing them at the gym, which is something that's never happened to me in any other leggings before."
3.0,"I think that this was an okay barbell but a bit pricey. The dream catcher slips down without the little rubber piece it comes with so be sure to keep it, to hold it in place."
3.0,Scratch very easily
3.0,I actually chose to purchase these because I thought they did not have so much distressing😩. They are not as pictured but they are still cute just not what I expected or wanted.
3.0,"Only one of the fit just right . One is either too tight and short and the other is too loose. All same size according to packet but I'm afraid to order just the grey one that fit just right in case when it arrives it fits like the other 2 ! In other words, buy at your own risk.. but buyer beware sizing not consistent ."
3.0,They’re a little too thin and I can see my hands thru the material. Also two pair of the 5 I’ve used so far are coming apart at the seems. I use these gloves to play Santa and I need a better glove next time
3.0,"very cute, but no push up at all."
3.0,"The outfit was pretty, but couldn't figure out how to make the skirt light up, it didn't have a battery compartment like the wings and horn."
3.0,"The elastic is pretty ugly (you can tell that from the pictures mostly), and they really need a garter to stay up (not something I mind).  Also the width of the elastic at the top can vary greatly from stocking to stocking within the same pair.  They run pretty easy too.  For the price though (2$ per pair), I don't think it's too bad of a purchase."
3.0,Cute set of fashion jewelry.
3.0,"Loved the socks, look just like picture but this item is not for plus size with thick thighs wouldn't stay up rolled down continuously had to adjust to knee highs 🤔💭😂"
3.0,Very nice toes looks confy the only thing shoes  run to small didnt fit my babyboy at all go 3 sizes up recommend
3.0,The shirt is very pretty. Order a larger size then you need.
3.0,"The wallet body is nice but the loop on the one I got was just a little satin ribbon, not even shoelace quality. It began to fray immediately and I have since just cut it off since it looked awful - see photo. That's after 2 weeks wherein I occasionally put it on a small chain if I was carrying it in my back pocket."
3.0,"The dress is cut strange. It's length is perfect for my 2.5 year old, however the shoulder straps are much to long and cannot be adjusted so all her chest is exposed. If i save it for her to grow a bit, it'll be too short for her in the legs! It's a shame because it could been my favorite dress for her"
3.0,I like it! its a little to small but its  nice looks cheap kinda sort of I guess... I guess you get what you pay for.... lolol
3.0,I liked the look of the glasses but the readers level of 1.50 was very blurred where other readers at 1.50 are very clear.
3.0,My child wore this coat once and the stiching on the inside came undone. It fits perfectly its just not very durable.
3.0,i love this super cute for the office
3.0,"They fit nice, but the “phone pocket” is laughably small. Way too narrow to fix most modern phones."
3.0,"Hat was a little long so as the top sits on your head it looks kinda weird, but I still got compliments on it and it's still very warm. would've given it 3.5 if i could."
3.0,Color not what I expected but still a nice blouse. I searched for black/white polka dot. Item arrived blue/white polka dot.
3.0,"Fun pattern and cut is fine, but could be a little longer. The material is a little thin and cheap. I've bought similar dresses from other brands and the material has been heavier and better quality."
3.0,"I normally love oversized clothing, but not in this as it lacks the cute factor.  It seems well made, but the details are mainly lost.The fabric is VERY thin, but not see through,  so I loved the 100% cotton.  Perfect for summer.<br />I wear a small, so it had plenty of room, though a larger person would probably find it tight in the chest.<br />All in all, well made, pretty material, it just didn't suit my taste.  Everything else I have bought from Yesno though has been a home run."
3.0,I think this look better on the maniken neck tham on mine.
3.0,I chose this raiding because it is just not the best thing I bot. but it mite fit 3 or 4 year olds.
3.0,Soft but has typos. Not original merch.
3.0,Not the best quality but it is still a cute shirt.
3.0,They are not big enough for me. I reordered I think next size up. Hope that works  better.
3.0,Too thin wont keep u warm
3.0,"I'm an inbetween size of L and XL but ordered a L. It fits but it's a little snug around the arms...if you got those bat wing arms like I do might wanna order a size up just to be safe. Also, it's a faded type of black which is a little annoying but nothing major."
3.0,"The sock itself is nice, but the ankle isn't fully stretchable and I struggle to get my foot through the opening."
3.0,"For what it's worth, I do really like these shirts as undershirts. I get compliments on them fairly often. As far as a base layer, they're cute. So far they've held up to regular wear (I wear all three over the course of my week, wash, hang dry).<br /><br />However, each one fits differently. One is very tight and would be unsuitable for anything other than an undershirt. Another is slightly less tight, and the third fits just right. They still work for me, but be aware.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'2"", 145 lbs, very busty. I'm about a size 8-10 US. I bought a medium"
3.0,Beautiful stones. Fragile metal.
3.0,"These pants are soft and fit accurately, but they are pretty thin and won't be the ones to choose if you were looking for some tummy support."
3.0,"It works great if you can get it to really stick, I have to reapply a few times during the night which was annoying"
3.0,Cute but super difficult to get wrinkles out of this even with a steamer.
3.0,Thin shirt small
3.0,"The T-shirt is just okay, it’s ok for the price. Not authentic like from MLB store."
3.0,"As seen in pic, the last one is missing an apple!"
3.0,"It had threads everywhere and looks and feels cheap. the design is pretty this is why I give 3 stars, but I was hoping it was going to be more like satin and fancy look. This shirt is not worth $25. It’s more like $12."
3.0,I'm only able  to wear the flower belts because the leaves keep popping open. I bought them because the review said the issue was fixed but apparently not.
3.0,This shirt looked like a dress on me then a shirt.. bought a small but wished they had a extra small. Returning😔
3.0,dress was beautiful but did not fit.  return process not simple but was completed as told.  refund has been applied to my card.
3.0,"The band was easy to install, but one of the levers was broken off (it comes with 3 end peices). It was only not 100% comfortable because of my wrist size. It was either too tight or too loose for my wrist, but it might not be that way for all people. It was pretty. Sorry I don't have a picture. I returned it already."
3.0,"I bought this thinking it would have more room as the model made it look that way. I usually wear a M/L so I bought an XL and ended up giving it to my small neighbor! Oh well, didn't pay very much for it so that was good! Good quality and cute dress tho!"
3.0,Runs small. Only complaint.
3.0,"these are great pants for early spring weather. unfortunately, I purchased these in the middle of winter. they are too thin for anything below 45 degrees. I like the way they drape and since I'm a phys Ed teacher, these will do just fine as we are indoors most of the time. if you put shorts on underneath, it helps keep you warm. I like how they look but they are just too thin. I would not buy them again."
3.0,"Dress was too long, inner slip was too short exposing your buttocks. I have to now figure out what to wear underneath."
3.0,"Great jacket, well made and seems warm BUT unfortunately too small over bibs. Order at least two sizes larger than normal size!!"
3.0,"The product is good for the price I paid. I was a bit disappointed with the texture of the fabric and how difficult it is to fold back to the original size. I am keeping the umbrella for back-up but would not buy it again. I also don't like how the design is on the inside of the umbrella and not the outside which is just black, but that is my fault for not paying attention to the picture before ordering. On a good note, the product seems sturdy."
3.0,"I followed the sizing guidelines which said I would need an XL but it was WAY too big for me so had to return it.  I really loved the shirt though, so I will be buying again in a smaller size. It is a soft material which is a bonus!"
3.0,"kind of dim.  not polarized.  apparently not available as such.  arrived with one edge bent up, but still wearable.  kind of pricy for what you get."
3.0,"Fits my wife, but barely covers my nose and mouth when I put it on, if i say a single word it comes off my nose entirely. Material, elastic, adjustable straps, everything else is perfect. Just wish it was bigger. Gave them to my wife."
3.0,Dress has very little stretch. The arms are extremely short so you can’t use the thumb holes. The mask does not fit over the nose and keeps falling down.
3.0,"This is an ok product, but be warned, the fasteners are like the price tag things you find on clothing. They hold well, but you have this plastic peice exposed on the inside of your garments."
3.0,Nice fit. Atlough got a pull in them after only wearing them twice.
3.0,a very convenient way to carry a spare pair of sunglasses in case my regular ones break  while  i am out
3.0,"This dress is overall nice and good value. It fits strangely on me sadly, but I’m 6’1” and an hourglass size 18 so everything fits me strangely. The waist rises really high and the fabric has no stretch so it doesn't hug or conform if you’re looking for that. The material wrinkles very quickly but I wore it to a concert where it didn’t really matter. It’s cute as heck but you get what you pay for."
3.0,Item material was not as expected. Used to wear on head at bed time
3.0,Sandals look great but the arch support is poorly designed. It does not support my arch very well and can be difficult to get used to it.
3.0,I ordered two one for both my sons 3 and 8 for their birthdays  they both love them but one of the clasps were broken 😕 theres a gap a big gap so it detached and sadly he lost his charm the second day of waring it
3.0,"The parts of the frame near the ears are not coated with any plastic, and they are rather sharp.  I'll have to find some pieces before I can wear them."
3.0,"Don’t be like me, order a size smaller than ur shoe size."
3.0,I wear a size 6-8 so I purchased a medium. The fit is okay but the wasit is extremely tighter than the rest of the shorts. After a while the biker shorts seem to roll up a lot. So I found myself constantly fixing and adjusting my shorts. They are not my favorite but the side pocket for your phone is very handy. Very lightweight.
3.0,"The watch come with a little tool to remove the links if the watch bracelet it too long ... which it is.  The little tool cannot punch out the link rod to make the adjustment, because the paint or lacquer on the links has sealed all of them in.  This watch is not impressive in its quality, but it is quite nice in its appearance."
3.0,Beautiful dress fix good every where but in  the arm to small
3.0,Most of the dress fits okay. The sleeves are very long on me. I am more irritated by the fact that I have searched high and low for a black and white striped dress and this is NAVY. Not even an almost black color. It is straight NAVY.  They didn't even send me the wrong dress because a navy stripe isn't even listed as an option.
3.0,"These are the best clear panel mask I've found, but they will still fog up. All clear masks will fog and it's actually pretty gross to look at someone else's wet, dripping, spit condensation mask. I would recommend only wearing it while actively working with those who read lips. And buy an anti fog spray."
3.0,"This was nice though description says stretch, and I need a stretch for comfort where as this was a struggle to even get on<br />My wrists are not big though not tiny either"
3.0,"Cheaply made, but okay for the price."
3.0,"I wanted to try on a black ring on my hand. I noticed many flaws as I tried these rings;<br />1. Not the same size rings even though they are a set sold as the “same size”; the smaller ring was snug and not too loose or tight on my right ring finger, the larger ring was way too loose and was more snug  on my right pointer finger.<br />2. Larger ring is not proportional when it came to the brackets that hold the big gem; making it look more like a costume accessory or child’s toy (though, I wouldn’t give this to a child due to choking risk or possible injuries from the brackets).<br />3. If looked at the rings closely and for a long time, then you will notice how amateur they were made.<br />4. Quick to tarnish or possible paint coming off from constant washing and contact to objects and elements.<br /><br />I would not buy these items if this was expensively sold. I love the design on the pictures; a reason why I haven’t returned these rings are because I like how the smaller ring looks and feels on my finger. I wanted to use these rings for work and not have certain inappropriate conversations from patients. If they continue to work on their metal and jewelry craftsmanship, and the gems were real; then I’d pay them for the real thing (that’s how much I really like this design)."
3.0,It was a little longer than I wanted
3.0,Cute but only for a child or teen as it has a plastic feel to it - ok for the price
3.0,"They are stylish, but made of a hard plastic. Very plastic. The lenses also are not very dark. I do own anout 7 different fit overs and this one is my least favorite."
3.0,Returned too loose.
3.0,This dress fit okay I wish the top portion of the dress was longer. I felt like the line sat right across my chest.
3.0,Color not as vibrant.
3.0,was smaller than expected.
3.0,"Wasn't what I expected, it looked better on my phone than it did in real life."
3.0,Tooo small...I buy a 36-38 normally...2X was too small.
3.0,"Cute dress-  I'm 5'7"", 135lbs and small fit nicely.  V-neck is not overly revealing but I do opt for a cami for modesty.  Sleeves are above the wrist, but not 3/4. What I didn't like was the cheap, stiff material used for the liner.  Outer layer is nice and flowing, but liner is stiff and even makes noise when walking."
3.0,"Seems like a pretty dress, but fabric isn’t at all as expected. Looks and feels like spandex. Can totally see through it. Decided to return."
3.0,Thick material. I don't think they are maternity underware.
3.0,"The material and color were nice.  The issue I had were with the arms.  The torso and arms were made for someone with a longer torso.  This dress was also very heavy, so the weird fit was more uncomfortable and I could really feel the material hanging weirdly.  It would have worked if I could have removed a bit of material off the top.  But this would be difficult to do so I just returned it.  Note that the dress didn't need a slip.  I'm 5'4 120 pounds and got the small in dark green."
3.0,Thin material. i noticed small rip around the waist area when trying it on. Wish I didn't have to send it back...
3.0,"Not too bad. Fits either eye and will fit under prescription glasses  Made of cheap vinyl, but ewhat can you expect these days?"
3.0,The printing on the back of the shirt should be a little higher. The bottom of the printing is too far down so it won't be visible if you want to tuck in the shirt.
3.0,"A little snug. I wish we could order sizes more like a dress shirt - with sleeve and neck size, but I suppose that would be asking a lot. Performance is excellent in hot weather (what I bought it for)... like Nevada desert summer outings. Comfortable fabric. I am slightly disappointed with the finish and durability; many of the seams and button holes have frayed after a few months of occasional wear."
3.0,So there's no tag on the inside to tell which is front or back but looks like you can wear it either way without it being noticeable. It runs a little bigger than expected. But I lover the material and length. I recieved this product at a discount or for free for a trade of an honest review
3.0,Mine shrunk in the wash. Super cute before that!
3.0,"this brand is excellent  i have purchased two pair from the Saxx site  when i saw this pair at a lower cost, i immediately  bought  the product<br /><br />i opened the box and saw the briefs.  They were labled large, but they were defiantely a size small. so i returned them.<br /><br />i regretted having to do this , as the others that i own are my favorite undershorts<br />i would give the product 5 stars but this paricular pair was mislabled"
3.0,I feel the pattern on this shirt doesn't match the picture. The gray is more of a bluish color. The neck seems stretched out a bit right out of package. I'm 4'9 130 I got a medium and it's a little tight on my mommy belly. Sleeves are a bit long as well.  It is a soft shirt and paired well with my leggings.
3.0,The package wasn’t good but the ear rings are fine. I think it’s good for the price
3.0,The zippers lasted 1 ride.
3.0,The bra itself is nice however i ordered a 6 pack in xl and 2 of the 6 bras were large instead of xl....can i return if tag removed?
3.0,"Good fit and material. However,  becareful bc the buttons will come undone. I had to sew the buttom holes up tighter to avoid a wardrobe malfunction. Other than that it's okay"
3.0,"Cute, but we had to fold the tongue over so that it didn't chafe against our chubby baby's ankles. (Still cute and functional with the tongue folded)"
3.0,it broken at the middle of the stones
3.0,Comfy but not very durable
3.0,"If I thought I was buying regular leggings I would give these 5 stars. However, based on the title and a couple reviews I thought these would be heavier gym wear style of leggings. They are not. These would be perfect for fashion or yoga. So soft. I mean seriously soft."
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful ring. Aesthetically, it's a 5 star rating for sure (so many compliments), however, the band at the bottom is really thin and what with readjusting it broke in half within two months. Sad. If you don't ever readjust it, it's perfect."
3.0,You might have to check on these throughout the day because of the heaviness of the pretend diamond they tend to slowly work their way out. I pull it through until the stone is almost touching my ear. The silver darkens where it is in your ear. I don't think it is sterling silver. Definitely not wise to wear too long of a day as it starts to discolor your skin around the piercing.
3.0,"Nothing wrong with the actual product, just keep in mind its style design is not really for larger hips and chests. I saw its built small so I bought a size up and still too small. Even if I went another side up, the proportions would be off. Great for small hips/chests."
3.0,"Its heavy, and the ticking is loud; but it certainly looks nice when needed to dress up for interviews and etc."
3.0,I like the way the look but I did not like the materia Too thin.
3.0,Pretty and sparkly but a bit big....it's too much for everyday wear but would be nice for a special occasion.
3.0,Good deal for price. I returned as it was too big.
3.0,"I like the look of the product but unfortunately, it didn't restrict the 'bulge' of my stomach as it was too big.  I ordered the smallest size since the reviews advised these run too big.  I am a size 7/8 and I got a small and it fit like a normal shirt not a girdle."
3.0,Was a lot smaller than indicated
3.0,"The length on these pants irritate me. I’m 5’5 and never had trouble with pant legs being to long, so I imagine this wouldn’t be comfortable  for most."
3.0,The reason why i give it three star it's certainly a; beautiful dress i wear a 4x and it's way too small and now they said i  can't return it like seriously and  i am really not happy now; i am struck with a dress that i can't even wear.
3.0,"The sweatshirt is extremely comfortable and fits as expected but, after a few weeks of wearing it the writing faded off a lot!!"
3.0,"they seem to be very good, threads are good, dice are made of a good plastic. i cant wear them though do to me ordering the wrong size. thier to small for their intended use but i was thinking bout getting a couple new piercings so it all works out"
3.0,"It looks nice, but it is not a 2X.  It is more like a L or XL.  It is a colorful shirt though."
3.0,"These are easy to wear because they are loose but that also makes them inefficient at protecting against Covid. Not unlike the gorgeous shoes in your closet that hurt so much you consider feet amputations. I have a number of these because the tight ones make me claustrophobic, but I would not wear one in a crowd."
3.0,I'm a plus-sized girl 220lbs to be exact and this necklace a very snug fit. My suggestion is to make the chain longer or the extension longer.
3.0,"I was hoping it would be bigger, but it works."
3.0,Material quality only okay
3.0,Order at least 1 size larger than normal.
3.0,The lenses are VERY prone to scratching. I'm on my second pair. I've had them for a month and this is what I'm looking through. I should have just spent $25+ and bought a better pair.
3.0,"Loved the design and softness of the set, however, there is virtually no stretch with the fabric at all.  I am normally a small, sometimes medium.  After reading the reviews about the sizing, I ordered two sets, one medium and one large.  The medium pants fit great, but the top was extremely tight on the chest and arms.  Had to keep the large set, wish the pants fit smaller but the top did fit better."
3.0,I don't like the material much and it is a little tight across the chest but I kept it because I liked the shape and length.
3.0,"The shirt is beautiful but it fits a little funny. I ordered the size per the sizing recommendation.  It's a little tighter than I would expect through the midsection and really long.  The sleeves are also a little snug, but I do have bigger arms."
3.0,"The dress itself is fine, no complaints really but Be careful with the person doing the fitting . They sent an email around 12:00 am saying they wanted my measurement. The next morning around 9 am they said they were just going to send me a dress that was not my size at all since they didn’t receive my measurements. When i tried to correct the person, although they did change it, they weren’t apologetic about the way they were handling the situation in the slightest. My dress came and it’s not that bad but i would be careful  with ordering"
3.0,"The new wallet was very nice looking.  However, the leather started wearing off immediately from my husband putting it in his back pocket. Then it started exposing white areas on corners and around perimeter of wallet.  I won't buy again."
3.0,It's ok but runs VERY small!!
3.0,I give them 3 stars they are comfortable and yes its a good fit but they seems to be used. I though t that I purchased a brand new pair.
3.0,"The straps fit my feet nice, but a size 14 is mot the same as a size 47.<br />These are more like a size 13 at best."
3.0,The posts irritated my daughter's ears...they are SOOOO cute tho!
3.0,Very cute! But VERY small!!
3.0,Adorable and so comfortable!
3.0,Said it runs one size smaller but it is actually two sizes.  If you wear a medium order a XL..
3.0,"nice design but the material is not good enough, is bending easily so is hard to appreciate the design as it is in the foto, it needs a better estructure"
3.0,They are cute but not what is pictured. They are much more white and don’t let as much light through.
3.0,"I have tried out different masks and with this particular one, I was somewhat disappointed. First, it will start to fall apart if you wash it in the machine and dry it. It must be done by hand. I prefer a machine washable mask which in the future I will buy. The other problem I personally found is that it is too loose at the back of the neck and I have to tie it in a knot. One last thing,  it is not that thick and I truly don't recommend it to others.  I have found other masks that really do a much better job. Other than that, it serves its purpose but I won't buy it again unfortunately."
3.0,The band was shorter than I expected
3.0,"I think, in general, leotards are usually smaller than sized. I bought this for my nearly 3 yr old. It fits her well with a little room to grow. The fabric is a great quality. The only disappointment was the 2.5&#34; hole in the side seam where it wasn't sewn together. I like it otherwise, so I'll have to ask a friend to sew it on her machine. (I'm horrible at mailing things back so it's less of a pain to have sewn.)"
3.0,"Only 32% cashmere and it’s hardly noticeable. But the 68% synthetic feel certainly is. I have small hands and these are snug. It they were actually a lot more cashmere the smugness would feel nice, for me it actually is a tight, uncomfortable feeling. My thumb barely squeezes through the opening. I will not be ordering these again."
3.0,"my daughter was super excited, but its small and i order the size bigger then she needed. she wears it anyways but for the price i was hoping to get more then a couple months of use out of it....  I was disappointed, but she was happy ."
3.0,After a half day of wear the leg holes stretch out a lot.
3.0,"Product is way too large on top. So large you would need to take it too a tailor to fix. Here’s what Amazon doesn’t tell you- the bathing suit is from Torrid. So, if they told you that I’m the description, you’d be able to look up the size chart on Torrid and see if the suit really will fit you or not. Hmm...she on you Amazon."
3.0,Had to get the large one even though I usually wear medium because I wear a 36C cup  but have a small waist and I read the reviews about having to size up.  The quality of the material isn't that great but for the price its adequate.  I think that the way it drapes might make this more suitable for women that have smaller breasts because the large size fit me on the chest and arms area fine but it looked like I was wearing a tent from the waist area.  It was too drapey for my liking but I can see how it might be suitable for others.  its really an ok top for the price
3.0,Only nice for few wears
3.0,Looked as pictured. Light weight cotton.
3.0,"Feels like Darth always be with me, the wind breaker has 2 layers!<br />A little long on the jacket no the sleves"
3.0,"This is a fine wallet. It has a good look and feel. However, there is no buckle or velcro or any kind of attaching device whatsoever to hold it closed, so it hangs open like an old used paperback book when you put it down which is kind of annoying. To fix that I just kept it under a stack of board games for the first week I had it, whenever I wasn't out with it, and it stays down now by itself like a good wallet should."
3.0,broke after 2 days. made with fishing line type string and it snapped
3.0,the ring is HUGE
3.0,It is a good wallet lots of space for everything I want to carry in it. The only thing I don't like is that the button that closes it isn't in the middle it's closer towards the bottom
3.0,This thing is big. Would do better in a woman's purse than in a man's pocket.
3.0,Order medium since I am 5”4 and 145lbs It was extremely large.
3.0,"This is not for plus size, curvy women whatsoever. I am returning this."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7211041b7b4632c80132e9cfc0291fbd]] THEY FIT PERFECT,  NICE COMFORT BUT ARRIVE WITH A VERY NOTICEBLE DEEP SCRATCH. THIS IS AN ERROR OF QUALITY CONTROL"
3.0,Came with a hole in the shirt. Ran really big.
3.0,"Cute bag but when wearing the item it doesn’t stay straight it flips over a lot and u have to keep fixing it, and the plastic already tore so I have to buy a different one."
3.0,"This is a good cardigan it fits well and the collar design is nice. The sleeves are confortable, generous and you can pull them up easy if you need to raise them a little for household chores. It is very warm.<br /><br /> I did find notice an odd small after opening the plastic bag it came in. I placed it outside to air for a few hours, but the smell while less, did not dissipate completely. I do not know if it was just my item, so someother process issue."
3.0,"This product came in three days. I felt they are quite a bit larger than expected, but will do the job!"
3.0,For the price it was definitely worth it. I used it during a photo shoot & it worked out well w/ some tights ordered also. I would order again in another color for the summer photos as ballerina
3.0,Fits good but after a wash it become linty they should make it with better quality over all its nice
3.0,I felt it runs a bit small
3.0,"I had no idea how small this purse is! Not to mention when I got it it had a terrible smell that, even after owning it for a while, hasn't fully gone away."
3.0,Did not like this product.
3.0,Cute but I haven't worn it yet. Shoulders are a little too poor but it's cute!
3.0,"I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I GOT THIS NECKLACE!!! I put it on as soon as I got in in the mail on Monday. I wore it to work and out for a few drinks with some friends, then I slept in the necklace. When I woke up the next morning the necklace had changed from gold to a copper color and the chain was all tarnished. I had to throw the necklace out the next day. It's too bad because I really loved this necklace. I received this product at a discounted price. Thank you for allowing me to review this product."
3.0,I usually wear an xl or even a larger running large. When the xl didn’t fit I ordered xxl and it didn’t fit either. It didn’t even seem much larger than the first shirt. I really like the material and would have even ordered a xxxl but the sizes do not go up that high. If you want it I would order two sizes up. Unless you like tight fitting clothes in which you should just order one size up.
3.0,Order larger size and still too small.
3.0,I ordered the white looking ones. They are very much so darker than they should've been. They are not a white lens. Other than that they are nice looking.
3.0,"The neckline wasn't what I was expecting. The picture makes it seem more like a crew neck but it was more boatneck. The sleeves were really baggy. Also, the pink was much brighter than the dusty rose color in the picture. I returned it."
3.0,"Cheap price, cheaper quality, sometimes you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Pros: They look cool.  People think they are very expensive.<br />Cons: Fog very easy.  For some reason, these polarized lenses give an effect like you are wearing 3d glasses or something.  Have owned a number of polarized glasses, but never had this so noticiably, to the point that I think something is wrong with mine."
3.0,"These are really cute, although obviously pretty cheap.<br />I love these until I put them on top of my head. Watch out for the part that sits on the bridge of your nose! Even if it's just for a second my hair somehow always gets horribly knotted to the point where I need somebody to help me get them out."
3.0,"I wanted a second white linen  blouse and didn't want to pay a lot.  This blouse met those standards.  However, the back of the blouse has twice the amount of material needed and the bottom half is 2x as large as it needs to be.  That doesn't show under a jacket, so I've kept it."
3.0,"Pockets won’t hold anything, fabric is shiny, a bit too short for me. I’m 5ft 9. Wish I could return these."
3.0,Its a beautiful ring but it will turn your finger green 🥲
3.0,Fit a. Little small but we’re loved as a gift
3.0,"It's a nice big bag, but it has a funny smell to it... sort of like a cheap Halloween costume smell"
3.0,"The quality is good however, a little snug for an adult.  It worked for me for my costume.  Just note it is made for a smaller person.  I'm a 35"" waist and it was a stretch.  It also wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be.  Check the dimensions before purchasing."
3.0,Love but they do scratch easily when flying due to manhandling and the material it’s made of. But works great for college students!
3.0,These are thicker than hose but not tights. You can still see a little skin color under them.
3.0,"Loved the bracelet it looked exactly like the pictures and looks great on my wrist. Only thing I dislike is how easily the charms break and when they break theres no way to replace them because of how it broke, I lost every charm except one within days of wearing it. So just be careful if you do buy!!"
3.0,"While the style is cute, unfortunately the size just didn't work for me. They looked baggy on my legs (even after tightening with the string), so you can imagine how strange it is to have to wear. They may work for someone else, just not me."
3.0,"I want to live this mask, but it's too big for my face. Anyone have a hack for making it smaller? Even tightening the ear loops doesn't help."
3.0,"I liked the ring colors.<br />When I received the ring , I was surprised how small the stones were in the ring ."
3.0,Very nice for a child
3.0,"Swimsuit came in cardboard wrapped around a noisy plastic bag.  Out of the package I could tell I got what I paid for and the construction was a little on the cheap side.  I had high hopes, though.  I ordered this in the XXL.  I'm a size 16-40DD, but the reviews made me think because of chest size I should order up.  Overall, the swimsuit fit ok, but because of the design of the top, there is no support and it feels a bit small.  I think if you aren't so endowed up top, it would be fine.  The bottoms were fine.  A bit on the right side but good booty coverage and ample height to cover the tummy.  I'm 5'6&#34; and it hit me about four inches below the top.  I was looking for a bit more lift and coverage so I returned for a different style."
3.0,fits the legs very well. The crotch pocket however is HUGE and is actually a pocket that kind of pushed your junk outwards.
3.0,The cup size is way too small but the skirt fit fine. I purchased a 2x but the bra cup size is way smaller.
3.0,I would not recommend this for women with larger boobs (I’m a 34G). This swimsuit is very cute but runs small and the high-waisted bottoms hit below my bellybutton.
3.0,Item is surprisingly very very very very tiny!!! It hugs the earlobes if you have a very small one. But it it also very cute. I was picturing it to be substantial piece for dress up days. This could be an everyday cute earring. I will keep it.
3.0,"it fits me fine, but it took for-ev-er to get here. Not as pictured - the brown on the skull is neon orange and what's supposed to be braided fabric on the back is just a bunch of cut-out slits. Also, it smells like gasoline. No care tags, but I'm guessing hand wash cold and air dry since it's made of some sort of synthetic spandexy fabric."
3.0,Bought this to replace the clasp on my daughter's LG Gizmo Gadget and buying a new band wouldn't be worth it. Originally got a 20mm and it was too big now waiting on 18mm as it has not been delivered as guaranteed.
3.0,Decent outdoor decoration.
3.0,This is good kurti in fair price. One need to wear a inner as this kurti cloth is quite thin.
3.0,Got for the money
3.0,I love all the pockets but it's a little smaller than I expected.  Very soft
3.0,"These earrings are beautiful, however, the item I received was not the clear version, rather it was the blue version and the pigment used to make the glass appear blue has bled into my earlobes and left a stain all around the inside of my earlobe. I mean, I'm not mad, it's rather hilarious, but I suppose it could cause some sort of reaction if someone was allergic to the pigment."
3.0,Had to re-sew one of the pockets already because it wasnt sewed together very good at the opening of where the pocket and  vest meet together
3.0,This dress was a bit too small in the burst area.
3.0,Ordered a meduim looks like an XXL
3.0,Ended up returning as it was too tight and showed every single bump and lump
3.0,NOT Made in America and it took a very long time to arrive.  Had to buy 1/2 size larger to get he right fit.
3.0,Super comfy the bottoms were fine but the top was a little big
3.0,bought it for a special occasion and it will work just fine
3.0,I was excited about this pants for my toddler but it is not as lovely as the picture. It look cheaper than in the pic.
3.0,I absolutely love the top it fit true to size. The bottoms on the other hand are like a small and I ordered a L...
3.0,Post had to be cut off and really flimsy.
3.0,Glasses looked good except black Oakley symbol was falling out on right ear piece
3.0,cute shirt it was just a lot shorter than expected
3.0,"scarf is OK but the ends are rough,not sewn seams.  Really sad.  It is light and easy to wear but looks bad with those seams not sewn.  Do NOT WEAR IT ANY MORE."
3.0,Warm enough for chilly to cold weather (30-40). Discovered not quite accurate enough for iPad gaming. Good enough to pull up and slowly respond to emails. Do not machine wash. Only two weeks along and stitching appears loose. Would pay more for higher quality manufacturing.
3.0,"Not a bad product, but not the greatest. They are a littler tighter than most sunglasses so I don't wear them very often."
3.0,"Nice looking, water resistant, luminous face, quite inexpensive.<br />Band is a little short but adequate. A tad larger than expected and slightly uncomfortable to wear. Maybe it'll break in. Just right for camping and water sports."
3.0,Rides a lot. Have to keep adjusting
3.0,"This watch band did come with pins (As there has been some questions to this I see), however, it only lasted 1.5 months and my husband popped the band off, losing the pin. I've ordered a kit with extra pins from Amazon, as this seems to be a habit with him. I like this band, but let me note that this band arrived a LOT lighter in color than what I expected from the pics on here. I'm adding a photo, please be advised this is after at least a month of wearing..."
3.0,"Looks nice, polarized lenses Lasted a few days before the earpieces on both pairs broke.  Still usable."
3.0,order 2 sizes up and too small.. great fabric
3.0,"For the money, its okay.  The material is thin and shows bra bulges in the back.  It is very long.  Almost to my knees.  I am 5'1&#34;.  I got the small based on reviews here.  I will not buy any more colors."
3.0,The eye part is really small
3.0,am little small in the bust and washed out pretty quickly
3.0,"Color was not bright like I expected! Although, sturdy"
3.0,"Bought small and fits more like an extra small, which sucks because it is so cute!"
3.0,"Lens scratches very easy on the inside, other than that they look and feel great."
3.0,"They do hang, but they’re very small earrings. I returned."
3.0,The end- was long in coming.  It was too long for what the story was about.
3.0,I never got to use it.  Th first time I actually tried using the screw from frame fell off and can’t find it.  So not fictional
3.0,I purchased these for my 4 year great nephew and only wore a couple of times and the strap broke and can’t return only gave 30 days but he didn’t<br />Get them till August 10 !!!!!!
3.0,They all came in but they were really small and the hoop ones don't even fit on completely around the nose. The studs are a better fit just wish they were longer.
3.0,pocket sits too low but I like it. I listened to the reviews and ordered up and it was a little too big
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter and within two hand washes, the lace began to come off the shirt"
3.0,I like this dress though realized I bought a size too large based on others feedback. It is okay quality and is comfortable. I kept it because the price was right.
3.0,THIS IS CUT VERY SMALL. ORDER A SIZE OR 2 UP
3.0,Smaller then I expected but feels great
3.0,"I bought this watch band based in the photos. The band is very stiff time will tell if it becomes more flexible. The picture is a bit missleading as though it's the right size and fits, albeit very tight fit, in the picture the band looks larger that it seems on my wrist. The clasp feels cheap as well. You get what you pay for, and honestly I like the band it's just a lot of little things."
3.0,Broke in a 2 weeks with heavy use
3.0,"The dress is really cute, but it’s too short. I’m 5’0” and it hit me mid-thigh. I sent it back."
3.0,Fabric on the cheap side.. jacket HUGE.. sent them back.
3.0,"Too Large in bust, Im 36 B, too short in torso length. Im 5'8&#34;.<br />Beautiful color, nice quality., I may cut and detach from bottoms."
3.0,give for christmas it kinks a lot when you wear it and it has broken already to which we lost cross that was on it .
3.0,The shirt fits too small but the pants are just right. Material is comfy.
3.0,"Because of a meniscus-surgeried balky knee, Iʻve been wearing Telic Z-Strap nearly 24/7 for several years. I decided to try the Mallory because my supplier said he wouldnʻt be carrying the Z-Strap anymore. The Mallory was also less than half the price of a Z-Strap. I found the Mallory narrower and a little longer than the Z-Strap of the same size.  I hope it stretches out and forms to my foot soon. Another thing - itʻs squeaky on certain floor surfaces. Not good in church!"
3.0,The picture is misleading. I had to get the dress altered because the front of the dress was too long and too open at the top.
3.0,Please be mindful that this is a cotton hoodie.  It picks up quite a bit of lint and it has not been worn nor washed yet.
3.0,"looks just like the picture, the chain fell after a few hours but it can be fixed with super glue, fits every size of hand because of long atachment chain."
3.0,i like it but be warned the mask might be upside down from where the bendy part is.
3.0,It fits but I bought it to wear with leggings...it's a little short for my taste but a really cute shirt.
3.0,"Shapeless, unlike the photo where it appears slim fit. Pocket is placed sort of high making it look goofy. I returned it."
3.0,"So this dress was super cute. The mint was a really nice color. But it was way to small. Like maybe 2 sizes to small? I'm a size 20 and ordered the 3x and while I got it on, it was tight. It showed all the bad parts of my body. And I'm 5'0 and this dress was way above my knee's"
3.0,I had to give it a 3 because I don't know if I should say it was too large or too small. The torso was too long. Odd. But the top part was too small for my breast. The strings are really challenging and whomever described it as sneakers was spot on. Go ahead and loosen them before trying on like you would a sneaker. Much easier.
3.0,The bracelet was bigger than size 7.  The seller did offer to refund but I am going to try to use the hardware to make another bracelet.  Hardware is pretty nice.
3.0,Ok for the price these are very nice! BUT... they run small! I ordered a size larger than what I usually buy because of reviews and they were still to small!
3.0,Mask sides go all the way to ear.  It is big coverage.  Print is cute and fabric feels good.  What spoils the look is the white all over stitching on black fabric - Not as pictured.
3.0,I was so excited for this shirt and now that it’s here it is really cute but it is very small. The XL fits like a medium so I recommend sizing up!
3.0,"It is hard to make this visor stick. Also, it made my helmet heavy and droopy in front."
3.0,"I have been racking my brain trying to figure out this purse.  Don’t get me wrong it’s an adorable purse.  There are two sections to this purse.  The front part, I believe, is for your phone.  At least, it fits my phone.  Then there’s a wallet portion in the back which folds up and has a snap.  However, there is a ONE INCH gap when wallet is snapped closed.  There is a great chance your credit cards, bills, ID can fall out.  The coin purse on the back is zippered though.  It comes with a 44 inches non-adjustable strap and a shorter wristlet strap.  Both are detachable.  The tassels in the front are cute.  I think the manufacturer needs to redesign this purse.  For the time being, I think this purse would be good for a young person who carries only a phone."
3.0,"Beautiful ring. Review update.  Initially I gave it 5 stars.  Less then a month of minimal wear, the  left side stone is now missing."
3.0,"I really like the idea of a denim ballet flat, so I was excited to get these. The overall look is classic. However, these feel pretty cheap and have almost no support or insole in them. If you need more support, I would suggest sizing up a 1/2 size so that you can put some insoles in them for added comfort. I like the look of these, but I just don't expect them to last very long."
3.0,"I ordered and 3X, didn't fix comfortably."
3.0,Great price for Pilates socks.  The toes are a little small but I ripped them a little to widen.
3.0,"While the bracelet is very beautiful, very lovely, and the quality is very good…it is also very dainty. The product description did not detail how small the stones were, and I feel the photos were misleading. I bought this to wear to a wedding, but I will be returning it. It doesn’t match the rest of my jewelry. It’s just too dainty."
3.0,"I’m 5’5” and 145 lbs. I ordered the 6-8 which tag says small. It fit okay. It’s shorter on me than on the model but it didn’t look awkward. It’s truly a wrap dress and ties hold it closed. I have pretty wide hips and it hit me in all the right places to make me look slimmer. I had to safety pin the top because it was veryyyyy low cut on me (but I do have a 32DD chest) so it may not be an issue if you have a smaller bust. I wore it to funeral and despite the circumstances, received quite a few compliments on it. It isn’t a high quality material and probably won’t last more than a few wash/wears.  But it served its purpose and looked nice so I’m pretty happy with it."
3.0,"So I’ve purchased and returned these twice now. Don’t get me wrong! They’re beautiful, comfy smooth, all the same size. Def worth the price if you can get some that 1. aren’t to small and fall out 2. are so big you can’t get them in. To paint the picture I’m a 00g and have been for months, I wear double flared, single, you name it. I bought these in 00G and they were way to small, and a breeze would of blown them out of my ears. Bought in the next size up thinking would fit better, and they are HUGE. Def a bummer cause it’s sooo many for the price and they are all beautiful plugs, but will be returning again and won’t be purchasing anymore."
3.0,beautiful but shrunk after the first wash. I also don't like the material.
3.0,"I'm very tiny with big arms after weight loss. If your arms are on the bigger side, the sleeves will be too tight. I returned it and the process was quick and easy. I LOVED the look, feel and material of the dress. I would like it better with bigger sleeves or sleeveless."
3.0,"For the price it's a pretty ring. but it is not a comfort band. It isn't completely squared edges but it is not a comfort band. It is a little big but fits well enough and you can feel the stone on the inside of the ring, it's not I comfortable but you can feel it there"
3.0,"These face covers are cute and are certainly a secure fit for a child that likes to play hard. A parent won't have to worry about the mask falling off and the child losing it, but only if the child likes to wear it. My daughter did not like wearing her's. She said it felt tight, and it was a little difficult to fit around her head without messing up her hair. My son didn't mind the mask, but he still preferred a regular one with the straps that wrap around the ears."
3.0,"Style-wise, these boots are really cute however I have wide feet so the comfort is not there as these are narrow. I can wear them but the top and sides of my feet are not comfortable as the boot is tight and does not allow for much wiggle room. Other than that, great boot just not made for wide feet."
3.0,CAN'T HEAR THE ALARM
3.0,"It's preeeeeeetty big. Not sure if I'd wear it often. It's definitely not an 'everyday' piece of jewelry, but maybe for special occasions or as a costume?"
3.0,The color is much darker then the picture.
3.0,a little loose
3.0,Definitely skimpy but will wear at the beach.
3.0,I followed the size instructions and it came too small
3.0,"It's a soft, cute sweater but the V-neck is ridiculously low. To keep from being completely exposed, I have to wear a shirt underneath. Does not look like what's pictured here."
3.0,"Our youngest son likes to wear these casual button down shirts. So I was looking for some inexpensive options for back to school. We will be keeping this shirt, but the material is cheap polyester."
3.0,Was hoping for better. Color and fabric are fine. I thought the shield was permanently attached. It isn’t. That was disappointing but it works so.....
3.0,Definitely need to buy insoles for these shoes other than that I like them
3.0,Ed for . Was recommendThis cute shirt is made for small woman. I ordered an extra large and it fit my friends Dee.  who wears a small. It is made about as well as a denim shirt is usually made. I gave mine to my friend who loves wearing it with the skirt that it
3.0,"The jumpsuit was as described. However, it fitted a little weirdly on my body... You need to have a specific body type for this jumpsuit to look nice on you. Does not fit well if you have big hips"
3.0,"I love the length and it fits pretty good. I just feel like the pockets make my hips look bigger. Because that's where it fits more snug. I'm 5'7 and 200 lb. I bought an extra large, and I feel I should have bought a bigger size for more flow. I will wear it around the house but probably not anywhere else. The materials great and the length is perfect. I probably just should have got a bigger size."
3.0,"I thought item was defective and ordered a second which turned out exactly the same! Photograph is rather misleading, thought it a horizontal intertwined knot design,  but instead one of the struts sits completely vertically making the ring very high like half a golf ball. Very industrial looking but maybe appealing to some. But generally I absolutely love Jude jewelry!"
3.0,It wrinkles after hand washing. I did not like that. It is comfortable though.
3.0,"Earrings are not as brown as I thought they would be. That can be good or bad depending on what outfit you are wearing. I was looking for something a little more brown. The round glass beads were also bigger than I was anticipating. This isn’t exactly the earrings I was hoping they would be, but I’m still wearing them."
3.0,This is used for keys and the tassel fell off within a week.
3.0,The cardigan is nice but after first wash it pills a lot.
3.0,Print was nice but way way too big to be flattering. Retured
3.0,"Very cute, but way too big for a toe ring. It was a gift for someone else so only time will tell regarding the quality."
3.0,Bottoms a little large and bulge if you tie tight with the wrap
3.0,"The dress is not a cotton material.  It is more of a thin sheer silky (like a little girls night gown) material with little to no stretch.  I didn't think I ordered a Large, but that is what I got in the mail and it was a bit too big.  This dress is very long.  I am 5'3 and unless you are 5'7+ you will drag this dress in sandals, but wedges would work ok.  I am not comfortable wearing this dress in public even with a slip because of the material.  It is a $5 +/- dress that will feel great this summer around the house and back yard.  The lighter teal stripe falls right to your butt cheeks and because it is so thin, it really feels see through in that stipe.  Again, it will be fine around the house this summer, but not an appropriate material for wearing in public.  My dress doesn't really looks like the photo. The colors are the same, but the top of the photo pictured is much more sexy and low cut.  My dress was cut straight across and not tighter around the waist.  It was straight cut down the sides from the straps to the floor.  Not the same dress photographed, but similar enough.  I am not unhappy with it, but I will not be able to wear to a wedding as planned."
3.0,The problem with this hat is the sides tendon to put pressure on your head.  A little padding on the sides would probably help
3.0,Did the job but you may be disappointed with the quality of material. feels very plastic and light. the head is also light plastic.
3.0,I would have liked to to give this 5 stars but one of the shoulder strap was sewn in with a twisted. Seriously disappointed and sending back for replacement. This is exactly what I wanted. Multi purposed vest. The flotation panels are removable so I can use as a 24 hour pack.
3.0,These are baby size and I don't know too many baby's with piercings. So unless your a toddler and have a desire to get fangs then this items for you. But if your a adult or even a teen these are way to small.
3.0,It fits a little too loose and is more peach colored than pink. Kinda makes me look frumpy as it hangs pretty loose. It is good quality though and the material is strong and soft.
3.0,"Looks great, but I immediately changed the clip to a key ring. It seems like keys could easily dislodge from it."
3.0,"These are great for the money, well made just to heavy for the spring and summer. Great for the cold weather."
3.0,A little to big for my baby
3.0,I'll probably order it in a larger size
3.0,I love my earrings they are very lightweight very fashionable for Christmas and beautiful
3.0,Too small for head scarf
3.0,Not a bad short for the price. It’s definitely not black though. It’s blue. And there’s a weird pleat. In the front that causes it to look maternity. It’s ok. I like the bright design. And it’s comfy and not clingy.
3.0,"I like to wear really light-weight running pants in the summer, both for walking around, jogging and especially for yard work in the heat of the day.  I was hoping that these would do the trick, but they have enough ""weight"" to the weave that tend to get heavy and stick to your legs when saturated with sweat.  I much prefer Nike Dri-Fit and certain Under Armour ultra lite running pants, which are lighter than these, do not absorb sweat and are a bit better made, although those fancy brands admittedly cost at least twice as much.  But for the price, this is probably as good as you can hope for in a reasonably light and comfortable pants with zippered pockets.  Certainly, these are better than the cotton junk that some stores sell."
3.0,Did not care for them
3.0,"I would go up in size if you want a loose fit, also is a little shorter. I got a medium which is what I usually wear, should have gotten a large for a larger fit."
3.0,"Not true to size, I ordered this in a size 3x<br />It actually fits more like a size large ."
3.0,not exactly ripped but threads hanging out at one end.
3.0,"**Update: I contacted the seller and they worked with me to find a resolution. Great customer service directly from the seller!**<br /><br />I ordered the ombré burnt orange and the color was spot on. Sadly, the top colored button was detached. (There’s a clear interior lined button also)<br />Aside from the minor issue of the damaged button (I can fix that) the angular cut/button line of the dress is barely noticeable compared to what is advertised.<br />Lastly and quite honestly, I have too much backside for this dress. I was hoping the styling of the back/hip area would compliment me, but it sits very oddly."
3.0,Cute style but runs small for sure.
3.0,Ice white jeans. Not see through.
3.0,Honestly I wore it and it was okay. The straps were way too long and they’re not adjustable. Also the seam that is supposed to go under your boob was just not gonna happen for me
3.0,"It fits really nice but I have a couple of issues with it, first,  it is too long for me but I am a petite so I think it will be ok for a regular sized woman.  The other issue is that the white one is completely see trough, I bought it to use it under a long shirt but it looked awful around my knees as you could see everything, it was like having and not having something on at the same time so I needed up using a regular stretch white pants and they looked way better than this."
3.0,"Not a fan of the material. Thought it would be a bit more stretchy, similar to the picture! Does fit, but I don't see myself wearing it anytime soon 😥."
3.0,"not big titty friendly, even if you get a large. i found that if i flipped the top over, and put the bigger side on my boobs instead of the skinny side, it fit perfect. i’m a 36c, 4’11"
3.0,"I was unable to register warranty with Seiko because an up loadable image of the receipt was required, but not furnished by the seller."
3.0,"the stitched design is not even, put together not quite right."
3.0,Cute bag but brown was oranger than I was looking for so I returned it
3.0,Sizing is not correct. Too large for youth sizes.
3.0,"I kept this blouse, but it is just hanging in my closet.  Don't know if I'll ever wear it.  The quality is very poor."
3.0,Cameltoe season bottoms.
3.0,"its huge... the diameter is big but that im fine with, but the height from your skin to the top of the watch glass, its almost twice the norm"
3.0,"Want to love this and did, up until it started fraying throughout. Have only been using about two weeks or so."
3.0,Cute dress and red all the reviews said that it ran small so ordered a size up and was way to big. Also it’s see through
3.0,I bought these for my Halloween costume. They are cute but a tad smaller then what I am comfortable with. I expected the white pants to be somewhat see through but they are very see through. Next time I think I would buy the next size up. Husband however disagrees with me on all the above.
3.0,The adjusting strap broke on me the second I put it. Now Ill have to find a way to adjust it myself. The tree's really cute though
3.0,The ring I got does not look like the picture at all. It’s still cute and not worth returning but I was hoping for something that more closely resembled the advertised product. It has a grid cut pattern and isn’t smooth like the advertised product- plain green with no marbling (or whatever you call it).
3.0,"Love me some Wolfmother. Great shirt, but a little big."
3.0,"I sized up and it’s still tight, not easy to sit in. Fabric seems decent quality and the zipper isn’t too weak. However it is not stretchy in the slightest so no bending over, I have to sit on my knees. The color was perfect and very vibrant, but I would size up maybe 2 sizes? Wide around the waist, needed a belt"
3.0,I just don’t like that the pockets are really deep. My phone falls all the way down to my knee and bounces around when I walk.
3.0,They are not as insulated as advertised.  Could use some insulation between the lining of the gloves
3.0,"The dress was cute and the buttons added to the fact that it was a solid color. Unfortunately, the large fit more like a medium and the midsection bunches up and opened by each button."
3.0,wish it came with instructions
3.0,"Nice demin material and well made but, to small for my big headed son<br /> I returned for a refund... Plus print is very small."
3.0,"Cute glasses, a little big. Bought for a costume piece. Was perfect for what I needed it for. Just a bit big for my head."
3.0,"The rubber part on it wore away really fast, like within 3 weeks. I have to constantly (daily) retighten the screw. Great idea, wish ridge would have the same holder for the air tag that's the best part of this other than that it's sadly not put together very well and falls apart pretty quick for what it's designed to be used for."
3.0,"This shirt ended up have an asymmetrical, off-the-shoulder cut, which I was not expecting. It's okay, but not what I wanted."
3.0,"This is my second pair of Vans for my daughter. I love the style and she did, too, which is why it’s super disappointing that they caused such bad blisters (you’d think I’d learn the first time). We have gone through a lot of shoes so it’s not as if I don’t know what I’m doing. I see kids with vans and everything seems fine, but those are with the Canvas-only material, I think. The fancy ones are too stiff and this means I won’t invest again-because I always expect some breaking in, but when I see it’s not going to get better, it’s too late to return. Bummed."
3.0,Not the best quality... definitely wouldn't but it again. But it's ok.
3.0,Beautiful colors but scarf is a square and can not be wrapped around neck like a traditional scarf.
3.0,The horn broke off within a month
3.0,Not the best quality BUT it’s a pretty good custom side gift
3.0,"la tela es excelente y muy suave. Pero corre super grande.  mi hijo es 6 en otras marcas y el 6 de esta le quedará como en 4 años más. solo pidan una talla más pequeña o dos, pero de calidad está super."
3.0,It’s good but not shaped for boobs
3.0,"The pack of earrings I received were different than the items I selected. However, the earrings look decent as far as color. They’re also very light weight. Unfortunately, they’re not my style, so I’ll be passing them along, but they look good."
3.0,"It was definitely a comfortable cute fit! It it would have had control top I probably would have kept it. What I didn't like was the colors, it didn't resemble the army fatigue like the picture. The beige had a orange tint, which I couldn't get past. The zipper wasn't a easy zip, but for the price it wouldn't be a bad buy. Especially if your tummy is flat!"
3.0,This item was returned because of my error.
3.0,The fit is ok but when the fabric is stretched it is almost transparent.
3.0,SUPER BIG FOR MY FACE<br />BUT VERY PRETTY
3.0,"I did not receive an extra battery like this says. The wings and ball are pretty but 5 seconds after I put this on, the chain broke and fell on the floor. I would recommend getting another chain because the watch works and its very cute!"
3.0,Beautiful dress but Runs to big. I ordered twice XL and L size and none fitted me.
3.0,I liked the dress but the sequin has came off and my arms kept getting stuck to the dress.  Most of the top part of the dress the sequin  is gone.
3.0,"Super thin,"
3.0,"I do love the dress, but I ordered the red and black one and received the purple one. Was unhappy about that."
3.0,"These are very pretty, and I love the different sizes, however on the smallest pair, the stone had fallen out. I will try to glue it back in as these were not very pricey and I do not want to mail them all back. I am disappointed that it came broken before I had a chance to wear them."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this sweater and bought it in two colors. Overall the fit was okay, a little snug in the arms which doesn't bother me, but I really wish it was a few inches longer! Came right to my waist. I have an average size waist, only 5'4&#34; and typically like my sweaters a little longer to cover up the belt line on my jeans. A little wrinkly after washing and air drying that didn't go away with a quick run in the dryer so took off a star for ease of washing/wearing."
3.0,"pretty tie, but not of great quality."
3.0,These slippers are super comfy but DO NOT leave them in the sun… they shrink 4 or 5 sizes to small. It’s too bad because I bought them for outdoor use and for the beach but they sat in the sun for about 30 mins in direct sunlight and shrunk.
3.0,The zipper come of in 3 days
3.0,"Cheaply made,  but for the price I will not complain.  I  bought these knowing they were not going to last forever.  Only thing I noticed so far,  was they are held onto your fingers by rubber bands.  I found some of the rubber bands broke easily. Again,  for the price,  I think a good deal.  As long as you know what your getting.  PS... All my lights worked as far as I know.  My kids took off with them right away.  No one said anything about any being broken."
3.0,"Cute! This arrived looking great! Yet, this did not last long. The foam ripped easily, would not last more than one event.<br />Not good for active kids. May be more appropriate for adults who will hold still and not touch."
3.0,I can say that this looks like the photos but at the same time I don’t feel like it looks like the photos. It is an interesting concept and a cardigan however when I see it on the model it looks like it’s tapered to go in at the waist and then out but it doesn’t do that it’s much more blocky on me and I was really disappointed in that. It’s definitely lightweight because if you look close it’s kind of a netted type of material with another thin layer underneath it so this is great for layering and good for fall however I just really wasn’t impressed with how it hung on me. I expected it to taper in and kind of go out and it doesn’t do that on me.<br /><br />The material is just ok.<br />As I said it’s different and unique for a cardigan and depending on your body type you might like it but for me being a inverted triangle it does not work for my body style and I’m not really impressed with the lack of quality in the material.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
3.0,My wife liked it.  We thought it was a Pandora item but it is not.
3.0,"I'm conflicted about this product I ordered on in October that was soft fit perfect I think next level or something good like that, it was stolen from someone within 3 weeks... ordered a new on it was ""damaged on delivery"" took 3 weeks to tell me that finally got it a 3rd time beginning of December but it's fruit of the loom. Maybe to undercut for Xmas but damn the sleeves are tight and don't go past my wrist like the first one and the material is coarse the design looks good still but 1st time 10/10 this time maybe 6/10. Aaahhhh!"
3.0,No so good as describe
3.0,Es un regalo para mi hermana
3.0,Feels like a mumu nightgown<br /><br />Update: @ least I wore it for pregnancy
3.0,"This is really cute, but heads up — if you’re doing a mix of landscape and portrait photos they won’t print the correct way. Contacted support and they said they couldn’t fix it, but did offer me a 15% discount."
3.0,Go a 10 pack but only 8 in the pack
3.0,The hat came half damaged :(<br />Otherwise I can see it being a cool hat had it not been damaged...
3.0,great light from small finger lights. It arrived just on time. As well as the finger lights worked for our show.
3.0,"These are so cute, but poorly made. They started falling apart on day two. I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,What I like about this band is the butterflies. They are super cute and comfortable on the wrist. The unfortunate thing about this watch band is that BOTH of the loops that hold the strap down when you are wearing it broke within the first week making it unusable. Very disappointing. Poor quality.<br /><br />Update: the seller contacted me immediately and offered a full refund. I added 2 stars for great customer service.
3.0,"These were a little too big for my taste., and showy. I wanted earrings to pair with a ring I had, but these just didn’t turn out to be the right ones."
3.0,Beautiful earrings bit the backings they came with did not secure them very well. They kept falling off throughout the night. You may need to use other backings
3.0,I really liked this one. It’s a sexy little black dress. It arrived quickly and it’s made from a very light material but it’s so cute. I bought this one for a date night with my boyfriend and it was fun to ware as long as you don’t have to bend over. It’s very short. I only gave it 3 stars because it was broken when it arrived  and it’s not well made. But you get what you pay for.
3.0,Colored Pieces from the metal missing or broken out upon arrival
3.0,They fit true to size but after some wear will discolor
3.0,Similar to picture but not the same
3.0,Chain was a tad bit short but otherwise<br />beautiful
3.0,"This is shown as a tunic shirt but came to just above my knees and I am 5’4” with a large chest, which usually makes clothing shorter. It would work great as a beach cover up aside from the fact the material is silky and therefore extraordinarily wrinkly! Also the back has an elasticized top which is just odd and the two middle straps are not adjustable therefore sag strangely. Overall nice idea but just doesn’t hit the mark. Has loose threads as well."
3.0,A little short if you're on the taller side.
3.0,"Very cute lounge outfit for Christmas. It does run on the smaller side. The top is nice and soft and really cute! I threw away the sweatpants because they were terribly itchy and uncomfortable. Not sure why the difference in material since it’s sold as a set. I bought a size S, and for reference, I’m 5’3 and the sleeves just hit at my wrists. The pants came right to my ankles. A taller woman would need to size up."
3.0,Little long on my 5’2”.  Will keep and wear around the house.  Did not like the ruffles at the bottom
3.0,The skirt was a lot longer than expected. Not something I would wear as a bathing suit.
3.0,Had to add non stick tape to the top to keep in place but overall not bad for the price point.
3.0,THIS BANGLE LOOKS PRETTY BUT ITS TO BIG.
3.0,"The band is very pretty. I expected the silver to be abit heavier and the outline of the fots to have indian ink around them, but they do not. Overall, i think the ring us is good value and i'm glad i purchased it."
3.0,"Good buy if you love big earrings, only downfall was received with pearl fallen off, nothing a little super glue didn't fix. Beautiful color, perfect for my pastel spring dresses."
3.0,OK not great!
3.0,"This is a nice looking umbrella and is small enough to easily fit in a purse or bag.  The automatic open and close feature is nice and works well.  But if there is any wind at all it immediately turns inside out so it's not reliable in bad weather, and if you can't depend on it to work then what's the point?  I would not recommend it."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but you can really tell it's cheap.  If no one is looking very closely, this would be a fabulous product for someone on a budget."
3.0,"Fine for the money. Too long for me, but kept."
3.0,The bows are hot glued on. Fell of on the first day. Needed to see them on to keep them in place.
3.0,The costume is fine. I'm 5''1' and the small fits okay. It is long. The quality is fine but the belt is missing. That is disappointing.
3.0,They are very big. They fall off my face :(
3.0,Very sheer t shirt. I normally wear a medium to large size shirt. I bought an XL after reading the reviews and it is still tighter than I would like. It is so thin I can see the tattoo on my stomach through the shirt.
3.0,I buy size large but is so much big for me
3.0,Very small & lightweight
3.0,"I liked the look and feel, but I have big arms and it was too tight"
3.0,"Definitely not sturdy. Trendy, cute, but don't expect top quality."
3.0,To fit my large bust I got a large and it was way too long
3.0,The picture showed pink/peach color. I ordered the same for that color. Instead i got bright cotton candy pink color. Not at all happy with the final product.
3.0,Stylish and comfy but like all Velcro slippers it wears out and won’t stay locked. They come off when walking up stairs so I needed up getting the Birkenstock essentials rubber slippers that are buckled.
3.0,"bought as a gift, she loved it!"
3.0,I got these to store a pair of aviator sunglasses in my car. Unfortunately this case is a bit too small. Readers and Lennon style glasses fit.
3.0,"I am obsessed with these pants they are everything I love in a flared pant! I got the biggest size they had purposely sizing up because, I like them long! At 5'7 most of these kind of pants are too short for me, I like them to be down over my shoe but, even sizing up to the biggest size they had they were still two sizes to small I couldn't even get them over my hips I was so upset. I would have to size up to like a 5xl just to get them to fit and they don't make them that big (note I wear a XL or 1XL in every pant I've ever owned)!<br /><br />If you can get ones that fit you there are so many things to love about these, first is the crossed waist band I love how flattering this look is and crazy comfortable<br /><br />The flare on these pants is absolutely everything it is so perfectly flared not too big or too small its literally perfect.<br /><br />The fabric is lovely on your skin from what I could feel on my legs, it is not soft and buttery like leggings but, more like a silky material just not as soft as silk it has a texture to it. These would be very flattering on the legs with that material and could for sure be used as going out or work pants because, of the fabric being more high end looking.<br /><br />I absolutely wish I clubs wear these I think they wild be my new favorite pants!"
3.0,Decent shirt-- looks exactly like the photo. Soft cotton. Fit is a bit boxy and it oversized fitting. Overall I'm happy
3.0,Zippers not strong enough
3.0,"It’s an attractive option for the Apple Watch. I wish this would have fit my wrist better. It was just too big. My wrist is 6”. This band had so much excess that the end of the strap looped up almost to the edge of the watch, basically doubling the thickness of the band on that side. It looked and felt awkward. . I was constantly sliding the moving loops in order  to hold the end of that part down. If you have small wrists, I wouldn’t advise getting this particular size."
3.0,"I purchased the Copi Multipurpose easy fit backpack for a European trip as a day pack.  It's a cute backpack and I like that it's more feminine looking than your average Under Armour, High Sierra or JanSport backpack.<br /><br />The quality of the backpack isn't the greatest, but then again it is an inexpensive backpack.  By the end of my 2 week trip, it was looking pretty shabby.  I wish it had zipper pockets on the inside.  The only zipper pocket is on the outside.  The straps do adjust to accommodate any size person.<br /><br />Looks wise I give it 2 thumbs up.  Quality wise, maybe a half a thumb up."
3.0,Two weeks in they started to fall apart.
3.0,Cheap chinese product
3.0,This product is not as pictures. You cannot fold the top of the boot over. The velcro on the inside does not allow it. They are not as cute in person either. The part that goes around the calf is very wide and the part for the toes is very small. This makes these boots very easy to kick off.
3.0,"You have to put it on over your head because you can't zip the back up without help, it kept getting stuck up or down, so you have to zip it up first and then put it over your head, the lining is a little short, also tht dress is not as flowing as I would like it to be but it'll have to work for the price."
3.0,Ugly print.☹️
3.0,Chain is small (Diameter and length) and wimpy compared to others I have purchased for the same money.
3.0,"I love this bag! I bought it because I needed a larger bag for traveling with my dog, a Pug, occasionally. You can stuff it with your stuff and theirs(food, treats, medicines). The strap is nice and wide but not so wide that it constantly slides off of your shoulder. There are 2 issues that I wish the company would take into consideration.<br />1). The color is supposed to be a light brown but definitely has a noticeable orange tinge. I'm keeping it because these days almost anything goes!<br />2) THE ZIPPERS are extremely fragile. They used a too thin zipper pull connected to the actual zipper by 2 jewelry-grade jump rings! It's obviously so flimsy! Very pretty and dainty looking. I've been lucky to be gentle and not break them as of yet, however, I will be looking for a sturdier way to replace those zipper pulls!"
3.0,Decent quality but it runs big
3.0,"Shirt seemed fine, but the large was too small for my husband's liking. The XL was way too big. Not sure why there was no middle ground."
3.0,Looks really realistic but hard to twist backs on
3.0,I bought a pair of earrings but only got one of them but other then that there really nice
3.0,Not warm enough by itself in the low forties.  Should have taken a larger size and then use a liner like silk for the cold.  Have circulation problems in my hands due to medications.
3.0,"The dress fit as expected. It's good if you need something to just throw on and go. However I'm not a huge fan of the material, it looks kind of cheap and the stripes are printed on. The buttons are fake also and the straps are not adjustable!"
3.0,"I’m 5’4” 40-32-42. I got the size XL and it was a tad loose in the busy, but too tight for my liking in the stomach and hips. You could see my navel clearly and there were folds of fabric around my pubic bone. Wish I could size up but sadly this dress doesn’t go any larger"
3.0,Very nice quality but very small
3.0,This outfit was nice. It was a great length and the fabric is not see through at all. Although the fabric was not what I expected.
3.0,"It fit's right, but it doesn't quite sit to the side of my head the way I hoped as in the photo with the model. I have to wear it as I would if I were wearing a cossack hat, and it doesn't look bad, it's definitely warm, just not as aesthetically pleasing as I would have hoped, but the quality of the hat is good."
3.0,"Really pretty , but soft and bent easily because it’s silver ... great if you ware it occasionally, but not for everyday ware"
3.0,"They are a bit to warm and don’t provide much support,"
3.0,I am 5’ 8” and have a longer torso so I am probably a bit too tall for this item to begin with. I ordered the XXL (US 8-10) as I figured this would be best to achieve the stock photo featured - but I ended up returning the item because I felt I was definitely compacted inside it. It was looser than fitted width wise but it was still not comfortable enough to wear length wise. Size up if you can!
3.0,"This blouse runs very small. I ordered a 2x, the size I usually order but it is too tight."
3.0,I ordered the large. I have a skinny wrist. The band was too tight and became uncomfortable within a few minutes. I will send back.
3.0,they're very transparent and much larger than I thought.
3.0,These bangles were gorgeous and exactly what I would like to wear. They were smaller than I thought and hoped and I can't wear them.
3.0,Fit was perfect but polarization was that of a cheap pair of Walmart sunglasses
3.0,Beautiful bracelet but cannot figure out how to open it to put it on.
3.0,"Good quality, soft and looks just like the picture. Runs large"
3.0,"The wire it’s wrapped with isn’t stainless steel and it tarnished within a few wears, but I still would buy it again."
3.0,"I have been using this headband for running and for yoga.  It does a great job of keeping my hair back and away from my face and on only mildly chilly days, it works great for keeping my ears just a bit warmer.  It's not the type of headband you want to keep your ears warm on a very cold day.  After washing it a coupe of time, it seems to have shrunk just slightly.  It's not enough to affect the fit on my head, but it's enough to pucker the seems just a bit and make it set just slightly wrong."
3.0,"While I do still wear these, if you have a size 13 foot like I do, it may not be the best option. The first few wears are perfect, but then after they stretch a little, the back of the sock tends to slip down all the time. It's an ok sock; it does it's job. I'll probably order it again."
3.0,Too tied the material is cheap
3.0,"Cute design, but larger than I expected. I was thinking this would hug my earlobes but it dangled down a bit more than i thought so I returned them."
3.0,"Smaller than expected. Mostly through the bust and belted area. The tie is not “self tie” as advertised so it’s not adjustable. There is a zipper along the whole back so it’s a lot more fitted than expected but then the bottom is more of a peplum fit than the model pictures show.  Thin cheap feeling material. I was really excited about this shirt so I’m  disappointed by how different it is than the picture.<br /><br />I’m 5’9, athletic build 160."
3.0,Very nice feeling and draping fabric but shows<br />every curve/roll...not attractive on me.  I'm 5'2.<br />135# and ordered a medium.  Rose was a pretty<br />color though.
3.0,I wasn't to keen on the material very shiny.  i ordered up one size I wanted a loose fit glad I did fits regular didn't get the loose fit I was looking for
3.0,The robe was the exact color and trim pattern as advertised. The price was also nice. The big gripe I have with this robe is that there are NO LOOPS to hold the belt. This is the only robe I have ever owned that doesn't have loops to hold the belt in place.
3.0,I really like the coloring of this dress but there are some small details I couldn't get past. The top is pretty loose and you'll need the chest tonfill it out. Otherwise it looks like you have droopy boobs. The split is also more of a cut out. The top part is curved and it lays open. Its and OK dress but wasnt right for me.
3.0,Works as advertised. Misleading picture of product.
3.0,I like it but somehow too small. It was not what I was expecting but I like long enough for cover up.
3.0,Just didn’t like the way they fit me. Nice material though
3.0,Lens popped out after about 2 wks of wearing them
3.0,Front coverage on these bras is not very good. There was a lot of side spillover.
3.0,"These shorts are very thin and lightweight.  I like the fit.  The “wine” color shorts bleed badly when washed.  I don’t like the appearance of the blue ones (I had much higher hopes for that one).<br />The material these are made from is not shown, despite being required by US law!!  However, if I were to guess, I would say they are a polyester spandex blend.<br />The wash instructions are written in “chinglish” and say “water wash, do not tumble dry, do not dryclean”.  I wash them in cold water on a delicate setting, and I do dry them on low heat, with no problems.<br />These are made in communist China."
3.0,These are gray tank tops but they fit too small
3.0,While pants were wide leg.🙂 Black pants are straight legged. OK but was disappointed.💁🏻‍♀️
3.0,I like the concept of the mask being able to hang around my neck when not needed. This particular mask makes it very difficult to breath while in use.  Have to constantly adjust to allow air in.
3.0,I changed the battery on this item right away because it was dead. Outside of that this item is perfect for small wrists.
3.0,"This is ok. There’s more fabric than I anticipated. Looks great with a belt or cropped jacket, but I’d never wear it by itself.  There’s so much fabric it kinda swallows you up and I wear an XL!  It has pockets which I love!"
3.0,Dress fit perfect and is gorgeous…..my daughter is shorter than the model so the dress was longer than she wanted. Shipping speed was terrible. When I ordered it originally said it would ship earlier than it did and then it took an additional 2 weeks than that to get it.
3.0,"Cute, especially for the price. Just wish the bow came tied and that it actually came with the hat as pictured. WAY bigger than I expected but babies grow fast so I’ll keep it."
3.0,I usually wear a large. This was alittle small
3.0,Size up. Runs small. Returned.
3.0,"I received the S/M 20-30 mmHg Support Stockings said to be for women's sizes 5-9. For reference I'm 5'3"" 150 lbs, size 6 pant, size 7 shoe.<br /><br />These socks were HUGE on me. They went up and over my knees and there was no compression, they just felt like semi-snug socks. Seriously lacking in compression compared to other socks I own, which is disappointing because they seem to be nice quality. Again probably because they were too big. They are a lot thicker than my other compression socks, the gray areas on the sock feel to have even more cushion.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the color. From the image I thought they might lean more toward a neon pink, but they are just a bright pink. Still a fun color though.<br /><br />I wish these came in a xs/s size."
3.0,"These are very pretty shoes, but the price (currently $24) definitely reflects the ""one & done"" intent that went into building them. So if you need a pair of very pretty shoes for a single event, these may work.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the box, I could see the insoles already peeling up from the base of the shoes. The heels look unfinished; the plastic isn't smooth and the rhinestone trim doesn't cover the entire heel.<br /><br />The sizing is very strange. I wear a US 7.5 and have a semi-wide foot, what they're calling a 7.5 worked for me but just barely, there was a bit of toe squish but nothing unmanageable. The confusing part is, they say they shipped a 7.5 but the shoe itself is stamped size 39, which is the equivalent of US 8/8.5 so I'm not sure what's happening there.<br /><br />I got these for a photoshoot and they'll work fine for that. But I don't anticipate getting much use out of them beyond that."
3.0,"These earrings are about what I expected. They are light weight with the preferred length and most importantly, the earrings backs were included."
3.0,"I love the bag. Brought it as a tote for my granddaughter.  It said it was 12""x11""..it is actually 8"" x 11"" . Okay for a small purse, but nowhere near big enough for a tote.."
3.0,"I bought these for my Mom. The fit was fine, but the cuff at bottom made it nearly impossible to get them on and off. I had to cut cuff off and make a hem."
3.0,The 100% cotton is very comfortable.  The size is about right.  They fit fairly comfortably.  They would be a bit more comfortable if they weren't so blocky cut.
3.0,"I was disappointed bc the umbrella was so small and difficult to open.<br />not as pretty as the picture, very dull looking. The rose looks gray instead of white."
3.0,I’m 5’5 and it’s knee length! Very long
3.0,"I ordered 2 pair. They are smaller than the picture...not at wide or long. They are beautiful, but smaller than expertly."
3.0,Glasses are too small. They would be better for a 2-4 year old small child.
3.0,"After multiple washings, this shirt still transfers color to my bra.  I thought after the first washing that maybe I needed to wash it one more time but that's not the case.  I've never had a shirt do this before.  I do like it and I do get complements but if you buy this, don't wear a light colored bra with it or it will be ruined."
3.0,"It's very lightweight, but it is pretty on sight."
3.0,My daughter ordered this “ I really loved the dress but it was too short! And a bit see through. I would recommend buying a size bigger. But otherwise I really like the design of the dress”
3.0,"Clasp came damage, had to return. Wife liked the design."
3.0,I order it so long
3.0,These are much thinner than the same company's bootcut pants. Shorter than chart.
3.0,Do not order the red color - makes you look like a giant Elmo doll. Wish I had picked a lighter color like beige. It’s very soft and warm. Be careful of the color choice.
3.0,Fell apart already...need to buy shoe glue to fix them. Very disappointed.
3.0,like but too small
3.0,Nice slippers. Exactly what I  wanted. Overpriced for the quality.
3.0,"It's a pretty dress but the issue i had was that it was bigger than expected for my size and it quite didn't fit very well, was baggy"
3.0,I did not get what I ordered. The belt buckle is different. I like that the belt buckles black but I'm not sure this design is strong enough.
3.0,"Pretty cheaply made! I'll wear them, but would not buy again!"
3.0,Liners are longer on sleeves
3.0,"Looks nice in the front, but the back is just string.  I guess it'd work if you're a pencil...."
3.0,"These socks are very cute, but the quality of the fabric is poor. They are also too small for my size 9 feet."
3.0,"This costume is really cool. I bought it for a non-profit Star Wars short film I’m making. When I first opened it a bunch of different costume piece came out. I noticed that it fit, but I’m kinda skinny and so the pants are way too loose. Also, there were no directions or diagrams on how to put this costume on. I actually had to look up YouTube tutorials because I just couldn’t figure it out on my own. Other than a few things here and there, I like the costume and can’t wait to use it for my film."
3.0,"Amazing design, as pictured. Scratches easily lost the item 2 stars."
3.0,Decent... Kinda cheaply sewn on velcro but it works
3.0,Not much tummy control.
3.0,Wasn't what I thought. I wish I knew if it was genuine opal. I gave it to an under privileged child. So in the end it proved to be useful.
3.0,This belt is as described and is worth the price but would have been much better price wise if so much was not charged for pastage.  I have a size 31 inch waste and it does not fit loose or too snug.
3.0,Meh. Not a super quality product.
3.0,"These glasses are definitely more for style than use. They aren't even close to being dark enough to provide any actual sun protection. The arms are flimsy and I do worry that the glasses will fall apart. On the plus side, they are light and comfortable on my face. The shape is great and the pink fade to yellow is super cute. If you are looking for a pair of glasses as an accessory for your photo shoot to complete your look, these are perfect! Just don't wear them in the sun and think they will help you out."
3.0,It’s perfect price for a toy for my daughter to play. However it smells really strong of metal and is very rusty already. I am going to purchase a better quality one.
3.0,my husband looked great.  I did have to watch a youtube video in order to figure out the buttons lol...but it fit okay.  The only thing im disappointed by is the fact i found the same shirt at burlington for $16.99.
3.0,i loved this when i wore it... then I had to take it off. VERY linty. like outrageously linty. and strings were just pulled off. the fabric is soooo soft. but that comes at a price. it just pulled apart!
3.0,"The dress design is ok but, the material is almost see through.  Kind of disappointed.  I paid $15.00 less for a different dress from Amazon Daily Rituals and was much thicker material, which makes it hang nicer on the body."
3.0,Gold began to lose shine and fade after a while
3.0,"I’m 5’6, 28 waist, 35 hips. Pant size 6. I ordered the size medium based off the products size chart in the waist. They fit as expected in the waist, but the back of the shorts ride up without them being fully high rise. Usually I have an issue with inseams being too short, but I actually think the opposite on these. Because of the fringe I think they would have fit me a lot better with a shorter inseam because they don’t fit like on the model for me. They’re pretty long. The material is light and stretchy. They seem maybe a bit big in the hips compared to the waist. Ill be wearing them come summer time though. Could have a better fit, at least for my shape, but overall they’re cute. I think I’ll cut the fringe short to balance out the length of the inseam."
3.0,Super cute shirt if you are going to stand an pose. I ordered a size up and it just did't work. It is really tight under you shoulders. I have a larger chest and I don't know if that just made the front stick out so much. It is a really cute shirt the sleeves are great. I am bummed i wont be able to wear it on my trip.
3.0,Order 2 sizes up from normal. Normally I wear a large and bought the XL based on reviews and it was still way too small. Thankfully it wasn't expensive enough to really be upset about. Otherwise the shirt is decently made and looks nice.
3.0,They fit big for the size....
3.0,The design is not bad but the material kind of cheap plastic
3.0,A little smaller than I expected. But a decent basic pleated maxi skirt.
3.0,The flower on the bow i received seems to be much smaller than the one pictured.
3.0,Band looks great!<br />Easy to secure and doesn’t slip.<br />However the band is small and I have a lot of problems getting watch over my hand. Maybe they sell a longer version.<br />I will likely return
3.0,"It's workable,  I was looking for few moew pockets to insert couple of more credit cards. Little pricey"
3.0,"I love this sweater's design, but the 'loose' weave presents a snagging problem almost consistently whenever worn.  Otherwise, a great sweater."
3.0,The slit at the legs are bigger then expected. The legs are looser.
3.0,If these are mens bracelets they are made for very small risted men the average size of a mens bracelet Is 8 &#34; mine is about 7 1/2 i get a link removed so it fits on my wrist right these are made much smaller i can just get them closed and its tight on my wrist i brought two of them one fits better then the other so i gonna keep the small of the two and deal with it i hope the leather will stretch the other is a gift i hope it fits them
3.0,It fit my mom well. She is pretty small at 100 lbs so it covered a lot of her. I wanted to order a couple more but was very disappointed to see the seller had raised the price so quickly. I won't be purchasing again unless the price goes back down. No one likes to see a price hike.
3.0,Too small for adult ears. Really meant for small children.
3.0,Cheaply made - already broken
3.0,"The medallion was perfect, but there's a problem. the gold color faded after a week of wearing it, which was pretty disappointing"
3.0,Pretty shoes and decently made. Run huge!!! I ordered a size 10 (the size my daughter normally wears) & a child visiting that wears a size 1 could fit them.
3.0,"Ordered the size 10M toddler for my 3-year-old that wears a 10 toddler in all of her other shoes. I could fit my finger between her heel and the back of the shoe and there was still space. Other than that, the shoe is adorable and my daughter loved them (and threw a fit when I said we had to return them, lol) which is why I still gave them 3 stars. Beautiful shoes, horrible sizing."
3.0,Fit as expected but a little thin to be called shorts. More like pantyhose. They feel good to wear under a short dress if going to be in a windy place.
3.0,"The colors of this dress are great.<br /><br />The size small was quite large though. Now, I do usually wear XS, but according to the size chart, I would've expected small to fit pretty well, and it's just big and really unflattering. If you're on the smaller size of small, this won't work. I'm also just not fond of the fabric. It feels cheap to me.<br /><br />If you're curvy, this dress might work well. If you're petite in the body and especially bust, it's just not a good choice."
3.0,little tight. but. ok.
3.0,HUGE!!!! Cute concept but massively big and heavy!
3.0,"Sandal fits well, but the Vertico sticker was already starting to peel off on the sandal upon receipt along with the rubber on the bottom."
3.0,The post in the back are too thin its already deformed and looks like its going to fall off! It really look nice but the quality of how it is made is not superb!
3.0,"I loved these pants. They are comfortable and lightweight and the tassel decoration was a great touch. However, they are poorly made and when they arrived two of the Pom poms were hanging off of the bottom. Would definitely have kept them if they didn’t have an damage to them."
3.0,"The side chest darts are not in the correct place, the neck is very low showing cleavage,  and the seams have inconsistent gathers in them where the corners don't meet sometimes. I purchased 4 dresses for a wedding,  but plan to send them back due to poor dress construction. The medium fits like a large. The color is reported to be burgundy but it's more of a crimson or deep red."
3.0,The frames are a somewhat chintzy but the lenses are good.
3.0,if you wear a 2 x shirt you may need a Large in this coat. I ordered a 2x and it was like a 4x size
3.0,Looks good for a bit but then turns green. Suggest using for special occasions.
3.0,So It fits amazing better than i expected but i do not like the fabric at all. I do find myself still wearing this piece from time to time and I get compliments on it. I will say buy it try it on and form your own opinion the product it is not terrible but it could be better.
3.0,"I love the cute print.  It is a piece of material that is sewn on so it has a cool shimmer to it.  I'm a size 12, size large and ordered an XL.  It runs a bit small and short.  The material has a bit of an uncomfortable scratch to it, even after a wash.  The material does not have the feel of a regular cotton t-shirt."
3.0,Ripped right away.
3.0,"As will the other Halloween gloves with fake nails it makes it difficult to wear the gloves because the nails extend too far past end of finger and nails catch on everything.  Nice enough set if you need for Halloween and don't mind if you can't use your hands much and maybe only get a few Halloweens out of them.  Some of the black fabric on gloves came off as soon as I took gloves out of the plastic bag.  Grey spiders on gloves made from plastic (which is okay), but some of the grey paint came off on my hands when touched."
3.0,"I wanted to love this suit. It is gorgeous and fit well, for the most part. I'm short waisted so it was too long and loose in the middle so I had to return it. If you have a normal to longer torso it would not be an issue."
3.0,This was a cute color but it didn't look just like the picture. The fabric was very thin and showed every bump and bulge. This top is for some with a flat stomach. I have a small tummy and it was not flattering.
3.0,"Pretty, however, the top is see through and the blue I received is not the color shown, it is more of a pale blue."
3.0,"It didn't fit me quite right so I gave it to my friend, she loves it and looks much better in it."
3.0,"Glasses are cute, but look way too small on my 10’year old son. They fit my 7 year old daughter well though!"
3.0,"Guess what,  it did show me another kind of green that used to be grey on the traffic signs.  Took the dot test and I could not see the figure 8 without the glasses.  I don't know if it improves other colors,  I mean,  I know what green looked like before,  but it showed me another green that looked like the color of a green pepper.  Lot of money to pay for a green that was grey,  but was almost the same color as a green pepper?  So I suppose it works.  Reds look redder, green stop lights look greener,  colors are richer,  especially when I see the paint jobs on cars.  Some of the colors are confusing,  since I probably never really saw them like they appear.  I see more colors,  I think?  But definitely improved the grey/green color thing."
3.0,"ok shirt, comfortable but really thin for the pricepoint."
3.0,The colors are as shown.  The headband is simply a ribbon and not a headband.
3.0,Didn't remove a stain from my chain
3.0,"No se ve de mala calidad, pero queda muy corto y si elijo un size más grande le quedará muy grande."
3.0,They bunch up nffront.
3.0,"What can I say humm, I'm 5,10 254lbs I order the XXL and the pants did not fit that well cause my ass is kind of big cause I really do work my legs I don't know if am going to return the pants but am going to give it a try maybe they stretch"
3.0,It's great for what it is. It's more like thin t-shirt material so it curls at the top
3.0,"Pretty buttery marigold color. Reminds me of Van Gogh’s sunflowers. Is very flattering in my opinion. Pairs great with a denim jacket and boots. Fabric is very thin. Wearing a slip under, not a must, but it will definitely smooth out any lines or lumps, and hide undergarments. Stitching can be better on the hem line as well as the sleeves. The elastic on the waste is very thin and only has a single stitch going around the waist. The neckline is very flattering. I’m 5’3, 155 pounds. I purchased a medium. This hits at the knee."
3.0,"Bought these for my classroom for our poetry cafe.. it was the most bang for my buck but you bet what you pay for! They felt cheap, not very thick or the best material… wish they offered different colors and they are kind of squished all in a box when you get them but they worked for what we needed for!"
3.0,"Got this for my son’s birthday on last Sunday. It’s alright product but not worth the money. My son is small and this one fit but for bigger kid. I doubt it. Material is not that good. When you take picture, it’s hard to see all the words."
3.0,"These slides are huge and don't fit a woman's feet because they are so wide. I think unsex sizes just don't work well because of the difference between men's and women's feet. It's the old adage of ""one size fits no one."""
3.0,watch runs fast gains about two min. a day
3.0,The fabric is so thin and noticed a hole in the crotch area after a few hours of wearing them. I wouldn't waste your money. Get somthing else thus is terrible quality.
3.0,"I received necklace earlier than anticipated, which was nice. I opened the bubble-lined yellow packing envelope and removed necklace from plastic clear bag only to find that it's separated and some stones fell off the necklace. The colors are different from the picture. There is no periwinkle blue on this necklace, instead it's royal blue, with hot pink, blush, turquoise, yellow, and some white (all plastic) stones; rhinestones & pearls. The hardware is silver however the chain is gunmetal color. Some of the stones are placed a little wonky. The 2 stones that fell off I was able to put some glue on the metal and place the stones back on. (I roughened the backs of both loose stones with a nail file so that they would adhere better.) Looped the rings back on the necklace and pressed them closed. Took some finesse. End result I was able to put it all back together in less than 10 minutes. This necklace was under $4 for me, so I don't expect grand quality. Others received their necklace in tact, but others have and probably will receive theirs in pieces....it's just a risk. Mine came in pieces, but ok to make it work. Pleased with the vibrant colors!! Yes it's inexpensive looking up close, but great pops of color."
3.0,"These were a little big for my daughter, which she didn't like, but they were so soft and comfortable that I kept them anyway."
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress - no doubt about that! It is a great dupe to a $70 dress at Nordstrom. However, I returned this dress for 2 reasons.<br />1) This dress is not ideal for big chested women. The spaghetti straps make it so you have to wear a strapless bra. However, the neckline is very low cut making any strapless bra visible. SOOO, it is best to use those sticky-boobs with this dress... so my recommendation is that anyone with a D cup or larger just pass on this dress.<br />2. The quality of this dress isn't impressive. I didn't expect anything super amazing based on the price point, but it is very cheaply made. I would be skeptical to wash this dress. However, if you only plan to wear it once in a while on special occasions then wash it on a delicate cycle, you'll probably be okay."
3.0,Not the best. But they fit well and get the job done
3.0,I bought 2 for my wedding and even though it looks wider in the picture it def work and are great.<br /><br />** ha after my wedding wearing these things my whole wrist was green. if it wasnt for that they would have been perfect
3.0,Looks great.  A little large though
3.0,Runs small. Need to size up. Shorter than I thought it would be
3.0,It's way too big I need a small instead of a medium
3.0,Item arrived in time and in beautiful packaging. The bracelet looks exactly as pictures. I ordered 2 bracelets and one arrived damaged.
3.0,Each sock is a different size. I wish I would of realized this before putting them on. They are made well
3.0,Makes feet sweat.
3.0,Dress ran small I ordered my normal size. The material was like a stretch spandex type. I returned it. If I were to order again I would def size up
3.0,They look exactly like the picture but they don't really stretch.
3.0,"I wish it was a bit smaller in the middle.  It just goes out from the bust, doesn't come b ack in again.  The fabric feels cheeper than other reviewers said."
3.0,So another pair that won’t work for my nipples because they are too small. Apparently the jewelry designers assume everyone has micro nipples. Reality is have a baby and any hope of regaining small feet or small nipples is gone. In my case have 4 more and your SOL that you will ever get a nipple cover that fits.
3.0,Hurt between toes but very cute
3.0,to me its more of a guys chain. i think they should implement smaller sized chain for women to wear with this as well. but all in all it hasnt turned as of yet so fingers crossed
3.0,"Very nice in concept and color, but my toddlers feet keep sliding out of the sides.  They fit very true to size in length and they do not seem too wide.  However, It seems that the leather is very soft and does not keep its shape, therefore, his foot will just slide right out of the shoe when he tries to walk.  I still give it 3 stars because they were well priced for the quality and he only needed to wear them once for a special occasion.  So they were perfect for that one time use.  After he was done, we put his everyday shoes back on so he could walk."
3.0,It was too snug and the sleeves were alittle short.
3.0,Pros<br />Bag fits my locker at my lifetime fitness gym<br />Overall the bag is good quality<br />The shelf for the shoes is great<br /><br />Cons<br />The compartment for the clothes is not enough to fit pants or jeans. Works best when you go from &#60;work/outside&#62; to gym when u need only workout clothes in there<br />The middle shelf keeps unhinging itself when I place my toiletry bag there.<br />The outside sleeve for bottles is for small bottles only. I have a bottle from bodybuilding.com and that is very hard to squeeze in there.<br /><br />I am going to use it but will not purchase again.
3.0,"This dress runs VERY small. I ordered a Large because that’s my size and it fit like I had a shirt on. The item was tight and very short. It’s not real denim material either. I do like the style of the dress, so I will be returning my item and purchasing a larger size that wil hopefully fit."
3.0,I own nearly a dozen Iron Fist shoes and love them all!  Some are more comfortable than others.  This pair are one of the least comfortable that I own.  They also make a weird squeaking noise with every step I take.  I probably won't get much use out of these. Somewhat disappointed.  I highly recommend the seller but not these shoes.
3.0,"There is no lip on the top and bottom of the cover, so it only protects half your phone. Cards stick out a lot, rather than being mostly hidden like all other wallet cases I've had. Also, you can't wireless charge with it. The color is nice and the leather is good for the price you pay."
3.0,They’re cute but the straps are thick and hard to get just right. The shoes are somewhat comfortable but after an hour or so become extremely difficult to walk in. I fell in the middle of a party in these and immediately decided to send them back. They look great but they weren’t practical. Buyer beware.
3.0,Ordered it as a gift for someone. It doesn’t work. Battery pack won’t charge and therefor the jacket won’t turn on.
3.0,changed colour too fast
3.0,Super cute but the fabric has no stretch at all. I couldn’t raise my arms to zip it up in the back.
3.0,I love the shirts they soft and comfortable but the shirt was really itchy and I can wear it
3.0,"The fabric is kinda shiny, Thin and cheap look to it. For the price of it don't expect more. Must wear with a slip or something underneath."
3.0,"Nice size, good length on chain, however the picture definitely shows a clasp and there is no clasp on the necklace i recieved.  It is all connected by a single loop that is attached to the pendant."
3.0,"Ok for the low price, serves it’s purpose. I was disappointed to see the gold on one side chipped when I opened them. The fit snuggly and comfortably on my face but they are not the best for wearing on my head... they are too flat to do that comfortably. But again, low price so you get what you pay for. They are about what I would expect at this price. Can’t complain."
3.0,This shoe was cute but way too small we had to return.
3.0,"My son and I just spent two weeks in Israel with a rental car.  This atlas was very good for the place-to-place driving, but not helpful for local driving once we got to a place.  For that we relied on an endless supply of print-offs of Google maps.  So, for peace of mind getting from Caesarea to Zippori to Tiberias, etc., and finding some specific sites that don't require local maps (e.g., Chorazin, Tel Dan, Banias), this was an essential purchase for driving in Israel; for utility at any one of those places rather than the in-between roads, it was not helpful at all.  As other reviewers have mentions, it's scale is also too small to be used comfortably if you have anything but eagle eyes.  Take out the pages on the 100 best sites (for which there are better tour books anyway) and give us some city maps; re-print in at least 8.5x11 format.<br /><br />I do have to say that the price tag is nowhere near the value of this resource when it is set alongside a 2017 US Road Atlas (printed large, containing many city insets).  It's a specialty item, admittedly, but we pay for this beyond its value.<br /><br />Unrelated to review but perhaps useful to visitors driving in Israel:  I found route numbers to be used less consistently in Jerusalem than indications by city name/suburb name concerning where a particular turn-off headed.  Just a caution, as this proved quite stressful.  Also, take into account the fact that the terrain is INCREDIBLY three-dimensional (unlike most of Florida, for example).  A road atlas, of course, can't prepare you for the amount of vertical distance you'll be traveling up and down from place to place."
3.0,They are cute just wish they were a little bigger
3.0,Its a very nice hat but the fit is a little off
3.0,IMO not worth the money.<br />The duck or black denim material is okay and there is a 1 inch flat bottom. But more like something you would find in a dollar store. It really is about the novelty of the print.
3.0,I like my clothing a little looser.
3.0,"This set is ok for the price. The color and quality are good, but the tie length was a bit short and the bow tie wouldn't fit around my husband's neck."
3.0,I am 5'8 and it fits really short!
3.0,"I was reading a lot of reviews about how well it stayed up, but it only stayed in place for me when I'm sitting down. If I'm moving too much while standing, then it starts slipping down. :/ It's comfortable, though. It being seamless is definitely a plus, too."
3.0,Nice sweater but it had a bad smell. When I wore it I got a lot of compliments.
3.0,"I like the simplicity and the length very much. Unfortunately, the pendant was more white than pink and the chain is already losing it's gold color."
3.0,Cons: Smaller then expected.<br />Pro:Good for child or teenager.<br />Read all specs. Not water proof.<br />Easy to use.
3.0,"I wanted to love this kimono and at first I did.  I'd say it is true to size, lightweight and great for the summer with a nice print on it.  The 2nd day I wore it it tore at the sleeve :("
3.0,Quality wasnt that great<br /> Picture looked sturdy than actual thing
3.0,"I was looking for something else when I saw this bracelet online. It’s described to be a ‘Turkish’ Evil Eye however it’s more of a Greek thing - these ‘evil eyes’ keep a person protected from harm and are usually worn at all times. I have 2 good friends that are Greek and they both have bracelets, necklaces, and other types of jewelry and decorative items for the house. I can’t comment on this bracelet, only what it’s used for."
3.0,This is not White. It is off-white. The material is great soft and a little stretchy. You would definitely need a slip.
3.0,This particular Orthifit show didn’t work for me. Too stiff.
3.0,It's not nearly as big as I thought it would be based upon the picture.  It's nowhere near long enough for me to wrap around my neck
3.0,"I am and ordered a Size Small, and it truly swallows me.<br />5’0”<br />104lbs"
3.0,Thin and a little small but they do the job ok
3.0,"I love the picture but beware when you have them in your ears you can not make out the picture, wish they were a little bigger."
3.0,Shoe too small and not wide enough
3.0,"Kind of cheaply made, especially in the V Neck. Good for business sexy though."
3.0,Glows in the dark great.
3.0,Runs smaller than normal size ..
3.0,bought the right size a little tighr should have bought1 size larger
3.0,Good but not pink like shown. They're purplely/magenta color. Dark not bright.
3.0,Nice but little tighter the cutting didn’t fix be good
3.0,"Well made product, however the ear socks did not fit perfectly, they overlap the designed area and slip on and off a bit, but for the price not a bad product."
3.0,Very cute but one of them started to turn a bit green after wearing. I haven't had a problem with the others just yet.
3.0,"Great design, great length, but for most shoes, it's just way to wide and thick. Consider your shoes before buying this product."
3.0,Like the fit and color.  Just the material is too thin. See through.
3.0,Cheap material but fits ok and very cute
3.0,"Sweater fit great everywhere except in the shoulders and armpits. Way too much fabric. Looked silly. Not want I expected from this brand, as typically everything is pretty fitted."
3.0,"The bra was nice, but even though I order a size slightly larger than I normally wear (38DD), this bra still felt too tight and uncomfortable.  Had to return because I could not wear it."
3.0,The padding does not fit my girls and i have small boobs.
3.0,"Print is a bit stretched out and the material is thinner than expected but hey, you get what you pay for."
3.0,I like the hat but it was ripped unfortunately and I gave it to my sister as a gift and she decided to just sew it.
3.0,The Pendant alone having read the reviews was exactly what I expected.  small (about the size of a dime) but otherwise what the picture shows the chain is what makes this Item only 3 stars the chain needs to be replaced before I wear this.  I purchased all three and will keep them because I love the pendants but the chains they came on are almost like they found any old chain to include. So if you like this buy it but buy a new chain for it.
3.0,"The material is very pretty, but the length is odd. It hit mid calf for me (I'm about 5'7). Not a flattering length for me personally, and not what I was looking for, so I returned this. I'm rating it 3 stars because it is a very pretty skirt, however I wish it were knee length at most. It is also very comfortable."
3.0,"I love this piece for the cartilage piercing in my upper ear. It is very cute.  However, the post fell off and I can't get it back on so I can't wear it anymore. :'("
3.0,"I really wanted to like it, but I feel like the sizing was off(big) and the placement of the lace across the chest was a bit odd."
3.0,"These are fun but very, very thin and see through. The material is really soft even after washing."
3.0,I ordered a 4 and a 4.5 and both are too big for my toddler who usually wears a 4. Theyre a little on the wider side too.
3.0,annoyingly rides up so I'd never wear this out in public unless it was over a bathing suit and I was at the beach or pool.
3.0,"Definitely my fault that I didn't fully read the description but there is a zipper in the back and on both legs near the ankles.. not sure how thats going to work with yoga. Fit as expected, material is not as soft or stretchy as expected. Will probably return them."
3.0,"I put fit as expected because I can’t be mad at the fit. It’s nice ...just not quite what I wanted. I would have wanted it to fit a bit more secure, (the reason for 3 stars instead of 5) but that might compromise the designers goal to be soft on the wearer’s edges. IDK. It falls off constantly. The weight of my hair pulls it off my head. Even when sitting still..I’m going to have to purchase and elastic band and sew it in for support I also would like it to be thicker and offer more stability as opposed to just coverage and containment ... I think being thicker might actually give me the structural integrity/security in fit that I would like without compromising the breathability of the hairline. . I tried to support it with a long scarf. Again... still a very nice product. ( feels silky and is barge enough to contain my long hair) Just not quite what I wanted... but I could just be picky 🤷🏾‍♀️"
3.0,It not self wind and only last a few days with having to set date and time
3.0,Runs small but nice quality. I like these to work out in but the band is tight. The color is nice.
3.0,"Very pretty.  Broke before I even put it on; however, I was able to fix it."
3.0,Runs extremely small!!
3.0,"I bought these as the design looked great and the fabric looked great in the images.<br /><br />I have a bit of background in apparel design so I was excited to try these out. When I got them, it was immediately clear I was wrong. I bought both the khaki and black camo versions and both had some issues. The cut was as expected, with a solid fit and nice length.<br /><br />The major issue was the fabric quality and the build quality. The fabric is very light and thin, like swimsuit material, but soft. The khaki color option was almost sheer in a way which is not ideal for athletic shorts, especially if I'm expecting to sweat. I also noticed some loose/long threads on the shorts that looked like they could be snipped with scissors, so not a big issue, but enough to make me believe the quality just was not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I would overall give these shorts a 3/5 stars, and wouldn't recommend to a friend but only because the fabric that was used. If they chose a slightly heavier fabric these would get a 4 stars."
3.0,"Comfortable bra, but I wouldn’t recommend for a high intensity work out or a jog. I’m a 42DDD, so I ordered a 3X, not very supportive"
3.0,"Despite the fabric being very cheat, it looks very cute on."
3.0,"The bracelet itself is okay, however the design was lackluster at best. Withing a few hours of wearing it, it broke on one end. (You should'v used stronger glue) I was able to repair it however, with a friction tie. I do believe it was well worth the buy, though. 3/5 because of crappy design material."
3.0,they keep sliding down and then my ankle begins to swell
3.0,"kind of small, very tight on the sides."
3.0,"This item is lightweight and very breathable compared to a regular face masks, which was my original purpose behind buying the item. Who ever took the product picture for this item worked some magic! The image provided makes you believe that it will look like your face is Chewbacca, but in reality, it looks more like a stretched out, distorted version of him. The mouth, in my opinion, are what made the image look so spot on compared to the actual item where the mouth is completely stretched and does not look at all like the image this product is provided with.  With that being said, I still think it is an identifiable image and most people who see it will know it is Chewy. Just don't go buying this item expecting it to look EXACTLY like the product image, because it will not look that good. Overall, I am pleased with the item, but I give it a 3 out of 5 for the misleading product image that will no doubt trick a few customers into buying it, only to have them be disappointed. (Please view my image for example when item is worn)"
3.0,To big :(
3.0,"Band is just okay.  It is challenging with the women's Timex Weekender because it is thicker.  That makes it more difficult to adjust on your wrist.  Since there are no holes, it takes a bit to tweak the fit.  The weave is tight and doesn't allow for ease of the buckle.  It is also bulky once buckled."
3.0,"Is ok for the price it arrives weeks before the estimated delivery date which was noce but the first compartment for the credit card can't use it bc the cards are way to expose it doesn't fits in there and the phrase on the front is misspelled should say FOREVER friend you chose and it doesn't,that first word doesn't make sense other than that is ok ...I'll keep looking for something else."
3.0,faux fur really looks faux
3.0,Arrived late due to COVID - but great design and super cool! I'm excited to wear it
3.0,It's nice but not as  nice as it loos in photos
3.0,"It's okay.  The leather is pretty low end and will break in with time. It looks good.  The deployant clasp works well enough, but it grabs arm hair like crazy.....worse than a stainless bracelet.  I'll keep it, it's not for daily wear anyway.  If it were, I'd toss it in the trash."
3.0,"My son loved these and the were a perfect fit but unfortunately, the plastic bit holding the laces together broke on both shoes after only a few times wearing!"
3.0,"Look good, but not as breathable as I would like."
3.0,"I thought I was ordering a package of two irenew bracelets--one black and one white--as depicted in the onsite photo. The package received had only one single black bracelet, not the two I thought I was ordering."
3.0,"This is ok but i do not recommend for hot weather, material is not soft"
3.0,This seems cheaply made.  One of the post is not glued to the middle.  You can also see the yellow/brown glue color.  One of the posts was bent as well.  I tried bend it back straight.  I thought the the color was going to be more of a purple but it's actually more pink.  Not sure if it's my eyes or the computer monitor.
3.0,Wear it at work. It's fine.
3.0,"Not many pockets, Very plain, Overly limited"
3.0,I cannot open it
3.0,"I like the dress but it is too large. It is supposed to be baggy, but not a sack."
3.0,"I love this pajama set.  The fabric is thick, durable and comfortable.  However, there are two problems with the shirt.  First, the tag was sewn in with fishing line, leaving ends poking into the back of my neck.  Not too big of a deal, as I simply removed the tag, but a problem that could easily be remedied by using regular thread to attach the tag.  The other problem is the shoulder seams.  There is a strip of plastic sewn into the seam allowance, presumably to make the seam sturdy.  The ends of that plastic stab into the skin at the neck and shoulder, making it very uncomfortable to wear let alone sleep in.  The only fix I can come up with for that is taking the seams out, removing the plastic and re-sewing the seams.  I have been wearing it inside out rather than rebuilding the seams.  Tacky, but I love the otherwise high quality of the set and am leery of taking it apart to remove the plastic for fear I may not be able to put it back together!  A comfortable, high quality, 5-star set, minus the tag and shoulder seams."
3.0,Love the color. I get a lot of complaints on the color
3.0,"I ordered 200 of the finger lights.  12% failed or did not function.  Had I known that there was a 10-12% failure rate I would have adjusted for that.  My event was within 48 hours, I had no time to re order."
3.0,This wasn't just a simple key ring. There is a hook for anchoring the lip balm case to the inside of a purse. Guess that is that was implied. I just wanted to hook it too an eyelet on a backpack for easy access so the hook is kind of in the way. Overall a good product just could really see the physical design until I had it in hand and it didn't suit my particular aims. Not products fault.
3.0,"Just like the picture, unfortunately mine doesn't close"
3.0,It was interesting that the shipper inserted a size large instead of the XL I had ordered. It fit!
3.0,"These USED to be the best stay up thigh highs anywhere ! As this country is based in London, I believe, I always had to order them from overseas websites after discovering them while in London myself. They have since changed the thickness, stretchiness and overall quality. The outside packaging is also different... so if you are used to the more outdated beige rectangular packaging that old school granny tights come in.. make note that these are an updated version and simply not the same. Bummed"
3.0,Haven't used them yet.
3.0,These run small. I had to return them and my size was out of stock. I liked them otherwise.
3.0,Very attractive jacket but sized way too small. Shoulders so tight I can hardly get it on even with just a light T-shirt under. I’m disabled so too much trouble to try and return. Would not buy again.
3.0,"The dress looks cute, its just the fitting. Its so tight."
3.0,It is the only real thing on Amazon that does the job of keeping a shirt tucked in tight but it is very painful if the item makes contact with skin/stomach area...not very wide so it happens from time-to-time. Word of advice do not put this on or leave it in your car! it will stick on every part of the fabrics and shred it!
3.0,Already falling apart
3.0,"It helps with the sun, however they bothers my eyes"
3.0,I got one pair in coral and another pair in black. The black ones fit great but the coral is too small..<br />I got a size medium. I'm 5'7&#34; 160lbs
3.0,"Fits everything well, but the elastic in the band does not hold up very well"
3.0,"did the job, thes.e skirts are built with cheep material a summer choice you will need a slip"
3.0,"Unfortunately, as a 5' 11&#34; athletic build female this dress was too short in the sleeves and length. Overall, it's a pretty dress but like most maxis or long sleeve items it's just too short."
3.0,"I ordered two different colors in the same size (medium) and this frost grey color came 1 1/2 inches bigger than the other chrome medium!<br />Also, the chrome color is much more purple in person. The pants are comfy but good luck finding the right color and size! Way too much effort in my opinion."
3.0,Dress is cute.
3.0,The leafs on one off the earrings is backwards
3.0,Hair ties don't stay in the groove. Bracelet is fine just don't work for the purpose they say.
3.0,good gift for any young ladies
3.0,Not promising
3.0,"It doesn't give a lot of control for placement. I do not like that it lays on your for head.  It leaves a line, although  I thought it wouldn't.<br />I let my son wear it, but he thinks it looks funny, and he's right.  I see that they have the tsurag 2 that looks more stylish, will give that one a try in the future.  My head is pretty large, may be that's why it didn't lay as well."
3.0,"I love BC hats, but this one just didn't float my boat.  Very comfortable though!"
3.0,"The picture makes this top look more vivid in color and nicer material than it is in real life. The material and print look pretty faded and cheap; the fabric is thin and light, like cheap tights or cheap workout pants. The cut and zipper are cute, I just thought it would be a little better quality that it is."
3.0,Cute as it wants to be but arrived broken as well. Doing a replacement....maybe a bigger box would be better!
3.0,Loved this dress except for the length. I’m only 5’2” and dress was still too short to wear to work. If it were a bit longer I would have kept it.
3.0,Smaller than expected and the seams didn't line up cleanly.
3.0,"Not exactly what I was looking for.  The belts are very heavy and substantial, and I wanted a belt a little softer and less stiff.  Still, I suspect a belt like this will last a lifetime!"
3.0,little small and looks reasonable price.
3.0,They are cute but my dog is about 10 lbs and they were to big
3.0,"Not what the picture shows,but at least they're the right size....i guess they're okay for the price"
3.0,I expected to have these keep my feet toasty.  Better than regular sovks.  A bit disappointed...still have to wear slippers as well around the house to keep warm.
3.0,"It looks ok.  One of the leather hoops where the band goes into was broken so I am using it with one hoop now.  Also, the watch was already working when I received it.  Don't know how long the battery had been working and how long it will last for me.  Other watch purchases I have made come with a plastic stopper that prevents the battery from working and the customers can remove that when they need to use the watch."
3.0,don't wear for more then an hour uncomfortable
3.0,"After reading some of the reviews for this sweatshirt I was somewhat concerned about how it would fit. I went ahead and purchased it strictly based on price, since it was so inexpensive I wouldn't be too upset if it didn't work out. Basically this sweatshirt is too large and too small all at the same time. How is that possible you ask? Let me tell you..... I purchased an XL, and compared to other sweatshirts I own, it's much roomier - especially around the arm/under arm area. It's also VERY SHORT. I'm a woman, 5'5&#34; tall and if I stretch my arms up over my head, my stomach is sticking out. Since this is a men's sweatshirt, and men are generally taller, I think this would be a huge problem - unless they want their tummy to stick out! If this sweatshirt fit in a normal way, it would be awesome (it's very soft and warm), but for me the fit ruins it. If you're looking for a sweatshirt like this, I'd say keep looking."
3.0,bought for my wife- too big oops. It kind of drapes over her. Also kind of long. Might want to go a couple sizes lower than you would think.
3.0,"I really wanted to live this sleep bonnet, to protect my naturally curly hair (4b-c) from frizzing.  I also use silk/satin pillowcases but the pillows slide off the bed.<br /><br />The hat is very well made, and it's fully lined.  It has a very pretty pattern (reminds me of lemons & limes) and the inside is coordinating solid gteen/gray satin fabric.  It's slightly slouchy: if you have shoulder length hair or fluffy thick, you may want to look for one with more poor or longer slouch than this. My curls stretch out to 3in or so and another month's growth would mean a need for a bigger / more voluminous hat.<br /><br />The 1in stretchy band that encircled the head is too tight.  I didn't want it to be tight... but several attempts to wear it the first day home and I found myself taking it off within about 20-30.min. I wanted to see how my curls did in a sarin hat vs satin p/case.<br /><br />i cant wear & return it (unethical).. so i will try using it for moisturizing treatments or ... for answering the door on a 90 degree fat of frizzies.<br /><br />God Bless our curls n coils!"
3.0,It fits great and is super comfortable but the print didn't fully take on the sleeves there are white patches otherwise love it!
3.0,NOT A LOT TO SAY HERE. KINDA LIKE PAPER BUT THEY WILL DO.
3.0,"very nice, but small"
3.0,A little on the low quality side.  I am not going to return the shirt but I feel as though I will not have it long.
3.0,"Only rocks to toe. Good push off of toe. Doesn’t stretch Achilles’ tendon, which I need so this shoe doesn’t work."
3.0,Looked great but after two wears all of the stitching came undone.
3.0,"the blouse is okay if it looked like the picture but it is way too small for a 2x and I thought the hem was going to be white lace, mine is navy blue ... defeated the whole purpose of the blouse, very disappointed"
3.0,"It was too little my bra size is 34c and it berly just cover my chest, u could see it if u made any movement"
3.0,"It's a gorgeous and beautiful watch, nicely packed, for the price, an exceptional buy!! Except for only one thing, my eyesight isn't that great. The issue I had with this watch, was the hour hand end, where it points to the hours. It has a white pointed arrow. For me, and a couple of other people, It blends away into the dial area. It would have been nice, if the edge(s) of the hour hand, would have been painted black, like the minute hand. You can see that on the hour hand point, the edge is raised, maybe the edge should have been painted black like the minute hand?"
3.0,"I bought this because my grandson is German. They're really pretty, but the problem is they twist a lot. When you're trying to put them on they twist around it's hard to get them untwisted.. But very Pretty."
3.0,"I had knowledge of what to expect buying this Jersey it being a replica. My daughter used to be a Bengals fan her whole life (mostly likely because it's my favorite team) but sadly she gave up on them (many wouldn't blame her) and became what I call a ""bandwagon fan"" and is now a saints fan. With all that being said I wasnt about to spend 70 plus dollars on a Jersey she might change her feelings about next season.<br />  As stated above I was fully aware regarding authentic and replica jerseys having visible differences * the logo is screen printed, while the other is embroidered. The knit of the fabric is different as well but truly the price difference was the key to this purchase.<br />   Now I would have gave this 5 stars for the decent design and price but for some awful reason at the bottom of the Jersey has a stitched Steelers patch! Now that is quite embarrassing!"
3.0,Loved the coin and the verse on the back..but I was so disappointed by the size..it's smaller than a nickel
3.0,fabric was thin
3.0,Love this necklace and always receive compliments when I wear it. However a part broke off the first time wearing it. The quality of the neclsce is not very good.
3.0,These were not long enough and the flare was not as dramatic as I was expecting! Got XS using the size chart and that was fine but I’ll have to return these! I’m 5’2” 122lbs for reference
3.0,"Size is as expected, I specifically looked for largest I could find. Looks great from the front, orange with color shift, as expected. However, wearing them the color is green tinted, which is not expected. I was hoping the color would be also orange/amber tinted, but not green."
3.0,RUBBER CORD IS BAD
3.0,"I’m a college student who needs a lanyard as a necessity, the “leather” band that connects the wallet to the lanyard broke after 2 months, other than that color is great and stylish."
3.0,"Skimpy cut, passible if you want a too tight fit.  Material better than expected, construction fne.  Sending it back, just a weirdly cut garment."
3.0,Way longer than the pictures showed and arms were baggy!
3.0,"Arrived broken but, seller was great.  Would have been very pretty."
3.0,Beautiful shoe but fit is a bit tight. Unable to keep.
3.0,"I thought the style was extremely cute and would've kept it because I loved it, only problem was that the balconette of the bathing suit top was far too small. This suit isn't made for big breasted women unfortunately. I'm 5'7'' 155lbs with a 38D."
3.0,It doesn't work magic but it helped. At the same time It wasn't anything a toothbrush and a nice scrub couldn't get out. Maybe the bottle works better I'll be trying that next
3.0,It doesn't look exactly like the pic as mentioned in a previous review.  Also the charcoal filter is useless because you cannot breathe through the filter.  Your breath just goes around the filter but its still a cool mask.
3.0,I like the glasses but the color is more pink than orange. I am thinking of ordering a different color.
3.0,Where the band attaches to the watch seems flimsy.
3.0,Cute a little short
3.0,Fabric pulled after washing once
3.0,"Would have preferred it to be more 3-dimensional, but an interesting piece."
3.0,I might look a little preggo or a lot of hippy. Thats the style. Use it for over bathingsuits on boat/on lake.
3.0,"It is a T-shirt, I wear it as a base underlayer.  Probably paid too much for it, but I love IBEX and will miss them.  Figured this is my last chance, so I bought two."
3.0,Is well made and light in weight. Blue stone around sides not too bright
3.0,More bulky than product description suggests. Too cumbersome to use.
3.0,Barely average adult size.  Great for small people.  No vavle mask included.
3.0,Longer than other &#34;Medium&#34; sized comparable socks from other vendors
3.0,"Warm socks, but beware: if your feet are over a size 6 1/2, these may be too small for you They're shorter than a crew sock, but higher than an anklet. Worried that they might shrink, I machine washed in cold water, then air dried."
3.0,Valves have fallen out and had to replace them. Mask slips on the nose a bit.
3.0,"It says can stretch upto 59"", well I can say it does not stretch as I am 59"" in the waist"
3.0,Not real let for adults… actually a childrens size
3.0,nicely made but small!
3.0,Okay I guess. These were for my son and you could kinda tell that they are NOT a brand name. Would not buy again.
3.0,The quality is ok for the price.
3.0,I was so excited for these and was somewhat disappointed. Got them for a dance recital. They arrived very cute and in multiple colors. Within a few minutes the flowers started falling off. Couldn't hardly touch them without knocking flowers loose. very cute though!
3.0,Pretty in person but the backs squeeze the ear too tight to be comfortable.
3.0,"These slippers were very nice, but were too large for me and I was afraid I would fall with them. I am a senior and lose my balance easily."
3.0,"Good fit for size 8 or smaller. Mine ripped in the crotch seam due to my nonexistent thigh gap n wide hips. Fit perfect everywhere else, wish they had a bigger size option."
3.0,Nice looking: nice colors.<br />Masks are a little smaller than I thought. They are also flimsy.
3.0,Very thin material. Lighter weight than the ones i bought from Walmart. Also the tie straps are a little short making it hard to tie in the back. Ships from China so tracking was sketchy at best. Ordered on July 20 and delivered August 2.
3.0,The quality of this strap is sub-par. The leather “ring” or whatever it’s called that holds down the excess strap is garbage and doesn’t stay in place. It’s stitched only once leaving it vulnerable to breakage. Bummer because aesthetically it looks good...
3.0,"I loved it. I was about to buy 2 more in other colors. Fits amazing, super flattering, and versatile. Problem is, after one gentle wash, all the threads are coming out and it's literally falling apart. Am I the only one? Is mine just defective or is it that pour of quality?"
3.0,"The item is decent. The watch looks as shown in photo with the Canadian Maple leaf design. The strap is a little cheap as the fabric in it seems to be shedding cloth, if you will. The watch does the job and is well made for $35. You really can't expect anything more for this much money.<br />So I recommend this as a gift for a teenager, who thinks wood is cool or as an inexpensive gift to an acquaintance."
3.0,Fits great when you first put them on but they grow over time. By the end of the day it’s like you have nothing on it’s all lose and everything bouncing around in there.
3.0,PROS: Easy to remove watch holder and easy to secure your watch to it<br /><br />CONS:<br />- After a week the winder would make a clicking noise and I had to move it out of my bedroom.<br />- You have to switch it between clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation.  It does not do it automatically.
3.0,Product was nice stretchy material
3.0,"They are a bit on the large side got them for my best friend, they look alright but they are so big that they catch on any lace she wears and they can be uncomfortable"
3.0,"i like it looks good but it keeps falling off my ear, still very cute though. i have to keep adjusting them, there are better ear cuffs out there."
3.0,"These are nice gloves but not great. After a few uses, they started to fade at the bottom."
3.0,Scratches way too easily
3.0,"This is a bathing suit top. Don't be fooled-it says swimwear right on the tag. It's sexy, but on DD+ breasts, even an XL is small, and it provides zero support. I'll continue to wear it since I paid for it, but the quality is low (think Wal-Mart swimwear) and the fit is small."
3.0,its like plastic
3.0,I’m 5’ 7” and 140 pounds. Ordered the Large and it was too loose on the waist but the perfect length- not too short.
3.0,The Charm was beautiful a little smaller than I thought it would be  But the clasp to hang it was way to small
3.0,"The lens do not turn clear even in the dark. They are lightweight, stylish and comfortable to wear."
3.0,"This is a super cute shirt if it wasn't all puckered at the seams.  If it wasn't for the stitching, I would have given it 5 stars because it fits great and flowy, and the color is true to the picture.  For 8 bucks I guess it's not that bad. I'm 5'2&#34; 115 and I got a Medium."
3.0,"Not nearly as sturdy as the Mokasso, and not as much support. I guess that's why they're listed as slipper...explains the price difference. But if you're looking for something to wear around the house, you could find something more comfortable."
3.0,"A very cute shoe, decent arch support, and a crossover for everything from work skirts to shorts,  but sadly not for wide feet; the hard molded sole is intended to 'cradle' the foot but cuts up into the sole of the wider foot. Boo hoo!"
3.0,Not flattering at all - meant for a skinny figure.
3.0,arrived on time and in good condition.  Just a little bigger than I expected and a little heavier.
3.0,love the design but the clasp slips
3.0,Just received it. It is pretty stiff material. But my biggest problem is that this is for “XL size” wrist. People with medium to small wrist will be able  almost wrap it around it.
3.0,"Had some stitching coming loose, it was just ok."
3.0,"For the money spent, nothing wasted.  But after an hour, we still could not figure out how to put it on.  LOL. but we had 74 cents worth of fun! Seller should include instructions for this item. We will order more from Toraway, their price is unbeatable, the unknown delivery date is a surprise in the mail, and the fun is well worth it. We will order 1 or 2 sizes larger."
3.0,Color red comes as burgundy and runs small
3.0,"this dress fit as expected but was way shorter than i expected. It was basically a long shirt on me and i am only 5'6"". Was very cute so i was disappointed"
3.0,"Not to be picky, but I received 19 colors,  and 98 tassels.  I think the description should be changed if you're not going to send 100 - 5 each of 20 different colors.  They look pretty decent."
3.0,"The colors are great and the nose wiring is good.  The masks are padded with the inner lining made out of some stiff rough material.  Very blankety.  Totally not like pics shown.  If I'd known, I'd spend a few dollars more for real silk masks."
3.0,Very pretty dress and was perfect for our princess ball. We did alter the back since the fabric covered the beautiful back. The clip with the bow broke immediately but we were able to fix it with something more sturdy. Overall beautiful dress. Not puffy like the picture but we added a tutu under it.
3.0,It fits well but the material is very thin
3.0,Top is bigger than expected.
3.0,"Finish is rough and super cheap looking on one style, bad enough to discard, other two styles are ok for the price."
3.0,"These are super cute sandals and seem of good quality. Only problem we had, was the toe box was way to tight. My son doesn’t have wide feet, so it was strange that it seemed so tight on him."
3.0,Love the patterns but the stitching is awful/cheap!! Not worth it. Both of these were worn 2 times each!  Wish I could get a refund on these.
3.0,Hat fits funny and is squished. 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,I would really like this mask if it fit! It seems to be made to fit children. The construction of the mask is great. Just to small for adults to wear with comfort
3.0,Pretty but a little bigger than expected.
3.0,Nicer than I expected. Very comfortable.
3.0,"Loved the design and loved the length of this jacket hitting just below my hips. Unfortunately the fabric is very thin, and in this particular design, that means you can see thru to what you are wearing underneath.  I am 5'5' and wear a size 12. The Large was a little tight especially in the upper arms. I have another jacket by this same company and the large was correct, so it may be cut a little small.  I am returning it, but might purchase an x-large in one of the patterns that is not see thru."
3.0,its an ok quality for the price.
3.0,"This product was ordered to use as an accessory with a Halloween costume. It arrived on time and the packaging was good. The product its self looks like vet wrap rather than a cloth type material. As a result it looks cheap. However, for the price that is somewhat to be expected. This product will only be used as part of a costume and then will just be used for play rather than to serve an actual purpose so for the price and short term use it is a decent product."
3.0,Cute sweatshirt however I  was expecting a sweatshirt material its more like polyester which I don't care for.  Probably give it to my great niece.
3.0,"Super tiny (I was worried it'd be too big) and very light. Can barely feel it while wearing it. Only issue with it is that the cutouts are complete, so one side is fully punched out and the other still has the black inside portion that should have been removed. It'd be better if it was either fully cut out (like the picture) or not, but the half and half bothers me."
3.0,"Shirt was pretty small, definitely not true to size. And it fit weird, besides being to small. The seams were offset and like sewn crooked. On top of that, it was seethrough.<br />Return shopping was hassle free. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
3.0,Not exactly as pictured but OK hat.
3.0,This dress looks like the pic and is true to size; however when u wash this dress the material fades a bit so I would recommend to hand wash it.
3.0,Be sure to measure wrist before ordering. These 8” bands proved too small for my husband.
3.0,This coat isn’t a super heavy coat which is what I was looking for. It was also smaller than expected so be aware of that.
3.0,"These are nice studs and I like the variety of sizes. They appear to be silver and are nice and shiny. The problem is the backs do not hold these well. I lost one of the studs already after only wearing it a few days. If you get these, I recommend getting some of those silicone backs at the store. They tend to grip better and don't rely on the groove in the post, which is mostly non-existent on these. Toss the backs that come with these in the scrap silver pile as they are useless."
3.0,I don't really love the functionality of this sarong. It feels like you have to struggle to keep the straps up on your shoulders. It is pretty but I don't use it much because it's a bit annoying.
3.0,"It fit well and it seems to be good quality for the price, but it was too slippery for performing aerial silks."
3.0,"I am in LOVE with the bling on my license plate holders; but after only a week or two of weather and washing the large round stones have turned yellow and some have fallen out. AM super bummed because it was super sparkly and shiny in the box, but it didn't last at all"
3.0,"it would have been perfect but it came with a hole in the side :( unfortunately aa's 'chill, new york street hip' image constitutes not having any quality control. i'm 5'9 and 130lbs, and i normally wear a small but knowing aa ran small, i got the medium and it fit well."
3.0,First one broken antenna second one no charge cable and missing part of the mount<br />No more refurbished deals
3.0,It's my good luck charm.
3.0,I had to send it back because there was an inch-and-a- half sized hole in one of the pockets.
3.0,The shirt is very comfortable but runs small. Sleeves are not long enough if you are looking to cover upper arms.
3.0,"They were comfortable and I liked them alot, too bad I washed them for the second time and they fell apart."
3.0,"Unique artwork, but colors are not as vibrant as the picture would lead you to believe.  First day I wore it my husband hit a bear with the car, so the bears seem to go bonkers for it."
3.0,I got this dress for my 23 year old daughter. The bodice has built in cups that were a little bulky but may work for someone with a larger chest. Also the dresses smelled terrible (a chemical smell) and would need to be aired out. We returned it.
3.0,This is cute but the tie at the bottom is weird. Not a good location for it.
3.0,"Some things about this shirt were misrepresented online. For instance, the pictures show both the lace just in the front, and the lace going all the way around. The one I received has the lace all the way around. There is also no seam going up the back like the pictures show. The textured pattern also isn't as pronounced.<br /><br />One touch of the lace is all you need to know that it isn't going to last. It has a rough, cheap feel to it, and it's cut in a messy way so there are already strings coming off of it.<br /><br />The t-shirt is soft, comfortable, and a good thickness, but it's not as fitted through the top and flowy at the bottom as it looks. There is some tapering, but it's mostly just a regular t-shirt (almost unisex in fit) with lace around the bottom. The color is like a light maroon, maybe a little more purple. The picture I took with the lace shows it best.<br /><br />I am on the larger end of 3X, so I ordered the 4X to be safe. It's huge on me, and not flattering at all because I'm swimming in fabric. So you definitely don't need to size up!<br /><br />Overall, I'm just disappointed because I didn't get what I thought I was ordering."
3.0,"Fits snug in the chest, no give material. Returned."
3.0,I’m only 5’7” and The opening to the dress in the front was right up on my crotch… Way too high for me. So I will be sending it back.
3.0,"I am 5'8"" and 120 lbs. My height is primarily from my legs. Medium fell just above the ankles. The ankles were pretty tight and had almost no stretch to them. The material seemed a little too slippery/thin for my liking. It seemed squat proof to my flat bum but the tag on the bag claims it's only 65%-75% squat proof. The crotch area showed every curve and detail which made me return the item. However, they did make my butt appear a little bigger and flattering. Not a bad product for the right body but it wasn't my cup of tea sadly."
3.0,"Beautiful bag and I Loved it, However made out of cheap material and began to fall apart"
3.0,very cute but way to small. Need to post the sixes correctly.
3.0,Much darker than I had hoped....very good for driving.
3.0,The belt was ok but started the break at the seams within 6 months.
3.0,Looks nice. Not warm. Sent it back.
3.0,"Very pretty, but you can't adjust and I have a very small wrist so it didn't fit :("
3.0,Why would this say expandable?  It is definately not.
3.0,"My mom loved it as a gift, but after only a month the magnet part broke where it allowed the flap (part with turquoise) to stick and keep purse closed."
3.0,OK for my purpose. Fit as expected.
3.0,Did not quite like the quality of the material. But it was good for my 5 and 6 year olds. They loved them.
3.0,"Small but nice.  Although they seem to irritate my daughters ears so not great.  But I love the hinge, way easier to put in."
3.0,"I do like it, but the fit is just so small in the waist area, whereas it fits everywhere else. I kept it because I generally don't wear it zipped up and like the color and fabric. But I would definitely order up at least one size if not two if you like a looser fit. I am 5 foot 1, weigh 106 and ordered the small. Not a big girl and when zipped up I feel like a sausage."
3.0,"I sized up from the guide and this was still super tiny. It looks amazing and the fabric feels nice, but I would go up 2 sizes."
3.0,Got this for a nursing top only to realize the buttons are fake. Still cute and soft just disappointed i won't be able to really wear it for a while
3.0,I’m upset that it only comes with one. I didn’t notice that when I first placed the order. If I had noticed I don’t think I would of gotten them. Almost 9 dollars for ones is very expensive. But they are very cute. I did order a second one.
3.0,Top and bottom halves don’t line up. This is not professional press!
3.0,"I LOVE this band BUT.....<br /><br />Comfort is a yaas: I am a student and easiest band for writing and using my mouse and my little wrist rest!  So much thinner than a silicon band.<br /><br />The but: the pegs are too narrow for my Garmin frame, a model it should fit. My band detached and allowed my watch to fall off just from taking my jacket off.<br /><br />I switched pins with those from a different strap snd so it should stay now. Also, there was not a 3rd extra post but they're too narrow anyway so that is not an issue.<br /><br />The color is also gorgeous!"
3.0,Adorable but too small get 2 sizes larger at least
3.0,The box and packaging were not nice and elegant at all.
3.0,"The material is nice, but I had a lot of trouble opening the jewelry back up once closed, especially in skin; there's very little room to work with to open it back up"
3.0,Kinda hard to put in but super cute
3.0,Beautiful dress as long as you’re not busty.  It should be stated that I breast feed so my boobs are exaggerated but I pumped first and still too much boob showing. I’m a 36dd- I do love the dress even the material just not covering the girls properly
3.0,"This is pretty, but WAY too large, size down 1-2 sizes."
3.0,just so so.
3.0,I ordered the white and black combo tank. The black tank was perfect. The material is nice and soft and stretchy and I read alot of comments about it being short. I have a short torso and the shirt went down to the side of my hip. The reason why I'm not giving this a 5 star is because the white tank came with a huge stain.  The stain is a perfect rectangle on how the shirt was folded in the packaging. I tried to bleach it but it's still yellow in the middle. I was disappointed because I really liked the black tank top.
3.0,It's what you would expect in an inexpensive tie
3.0,"It's really cute and very soft material used. It's just not petite enough for me. The rise is a little long on me, I'm 4ft 9 and weight 145. I have a medium build but I think I would feel uncomfortable wearing it. I may gift it to someone that has the shape to pull it off. I'm so disappointed I really wanted to wear this..."
3.0,"I did not get to wear it,  size was too big, it cost almost half the price to return it."
3.0,Clasp isn't very strong but it looks nice
3.0,Los clips de.metal no duran mucho
3.0,The top fits well to small. The bottoms fit perfectly.
3.0,"I love you, Amazon, but it said it was handed to me directly it was not it was by the door which is fine. Also I ordered a large and the large is rather small must be for a little people I weigh 135 I can only imagine what a small looks like, but it was pretty. I will be sending it back."
3.0,El saco no es la talla que dise yo la compre mediana y si llego esa talla pero para mi no es mediana es una talla xxsss súper chica mangas muy estrechas en fin todo está estrecha nunca lo use no lo quise regresar porque una vez regrese algo de 30 dólares y nunca me lo rembolso Amazon por eso ya no les regreso nada y a un tengo ese saco guardado  súper pequeño por eso ya tengo más cuidado con la ropa que compro gracias Amazon
3.0,The product is perfect. Cute and comfortable. The shipping execution was awful. They didn't send them in time for Christmas and I had to contact the seller directly to get them to me in January.
3.0,"It is thin and slightly sheer.  I returned it, but it would be good for the summer/spring.  Don't expect a sweater material."
3.0,"These are cute, but not worth much. They don't bother my sensitive ears and they shipped fast. Up close they look cheaper than from afar. I got the 8mm and they fit nicely on my regular sized ears (not too big or small). I think the 6mm may be good for kids or adults who don't want statement fireballs. Good value for 8 pairs of earrings in different colors."
3.0,Style runs big so don't buy if you are of petite frame.<br />Style is nice but perhaps too warm if using for hot climate
3.0,The Shirt is a good size but the shorts are way too small.
3.0,"I used this belly ring maybe twice and the Squirtle piece fell off, luckily I found the piece and was able to hook it back on but I was not impressed with that."
3.0,"I have a lot of hair, so this fit a little snug...didn't cover my ears as I'd hoped :("
3.0,"It okay for the price, but I thought the ropes would be separate but they were not."
3.0,"Good set for the money. The clasps are hard to open but I guess that's good if you want them to stay in. My biggest issue was with the captive bead ring, it is not smooth where the bead sits. It looks like it was cut with wire cutters then shipped out & the beads are barely able to get in or out."
3.0,"The bras thenselves are very cute! However, I was disappointed when they came and were way to small. I could tell just by looking at them before even trying them on. Indeed when trying them on they were way too tight. I wear a size 36C I will be reordering a 40C by the way they fit and hoping that one fits."
3.0,"I returned mine due to wrong info on size chart.  Seems as if we need to size down when we don't.  If you're a large, order a large!"
3.0,"WAY TO SMALL! A nice jacket but sizes would be ""MISSES"""
3.0,"Love the design but it is way too tight.  I checked and double checked what size I needed to get from reviews and the measurement chart and even though I normally wear a large this ""large"" fits like a medium.<br /><br />If you are busty buy the next size up"
3.0,"Cheap, but fun"
3.0,"If you're a pear shape, consider ordering a size up. Very snug in the lower abdomen/hip area."
3.0,Just a weird fit weird material. Seems very cheap. Does not look right on. Not at all like the photos. Was worth trying but didn’t work
3.0,Little small for a girl age 3
3.0,Hay que fijarse bien en las talla. Lo compre talla M y no me queda ceñido pero no esta mal. No quede muy contenta con el resultado pero es un buen vestido.
3.0,It is very small and the ilo is very thin and it breaks very quickly I do not think I can buy it again its quality It is very small and the ilo is very thin and it breaks very quickly I do not think I can buy it again its quality is very fragile
3.0,A beautiful dress!<br />&#34;warning&#34; ask for a size more bigger
3.0,Very attractive however they are so long that they get in the way and get caught and everything. I thought they were going to be 24 inches long by what the description was but they are 30+ inches. Way too long.
3.0,"Had to send back, had a small hole at bottom of dress.....other then that it was cute and fit amazing"
3.0,not very impressed with the fit.
3.0,Extremely thin material. I'd give it a better review if the fleece side were much thicker.
3.0,"It is good, breathable material. But it didn't tuck my tummy as I expected!"
3.0,"my little girl love these (they fit adults, but work if i tie the ear loops and it fits under her chin). they are kinda scratchy, but the metallic material makes a buzzing noise when you breath through it just so. super fun! or super annoying!"
3.0,"Ordered the Color ""Allover Blue"".  Pic appears a gray blue which is desired.  What arrived is a Powder Blue, nowhere near the Pic.  98% of colors presented by other sellers onscreen are spot on upon arrival, the rest are just a shade off but this blouse is so far from the Pic, the only thing that matches the color is the word Blue.  It was a decent buy and I'll keep it but disappointed in the color difference extreme."
3.0,These are nice warm gloves but way too small for my american hands.  Hopefully we can find a lady with tiny hands or a young girl to give them to.  They are warm however they are not finished carefully.  Good value but once size fit all only fits ladies with tiny hands in this case!<br />I received these in exchange for honest review.  Do to think these will fit my huband or I but maybe a very small child!
3.0,They are comfortable but because of the color it shows all my cellulite. If you are skinny then these are for you. But if you are thick and have cellulite then i wouldn’t recommend. It looks tacky on us thicker girls
3.0,"This is a knockoff of a much more expensive dress from the Pretty Dress Company.  I wasn't expecting much given the price difference, but it was okay.<br /><br />It doesn't feel quite as elegant as the pictures look, but having never seen the non-knockoff dress in person I can't compare the two side by side.  The print is accurate if a little bit lighter than the picture (the green is less rich).  There is a built in crinoline inside to give a bit of poof to the shape, but it doesn't do a huge amount since it's fairly thin.<br /><br />The fit was very size accurate and there is a bit of stretch to the material.  I ordered the XL and it was about 21&#34; across the bust and 17.5&#34; across the waist.<br /><br />I ended up returning this because it still looked pretty cheap compared to what I was expecting from the picture, but it's not a terrible little dress and seemed well enough made."
3.0,Buy at least 2 inches bigger than waist size.
3.0,Awkward diagonal seams running across front of shirt.  Fabric bunches there and looks/feels weird.  Otherwise OK.
3.0,I cant seem to find a pair of white jeans that are quality anymore. You can see the pockets thru the fabric. its awful. Very thin material. Too bad because they fit ok!
3.0,It was quite small and did not have a snap closure.
3.0,This was for my teen son to give his girlfriend. Looks really plastic instead of leather but for teens it was fine. Adults not so much
3.0,this was also a gift for my teen daughter it doesn't stay on her ear she had to alter it a little to make it stay good for her because she makes jewelry so she is able to wear it
3.0,"Good idea,  it hard to open . I pinched my finger trying to make it work and had a sore finger and bruise for a week. My husband managed to open it but it is not worth the effort, so it sits in the garage unused."
3.0,she loves the look and it fit perfect. the black wares off very quickly. very cheep coating.
3.0,"They don't hold a spare charge like the original one does,  but they do the job of charging the watch just fine.  The connection to the USB seems a little sketchy, but for tee price, it does what I needed it for"
3.0,"Material is nice. I love the cowl neck, but it's too tight around my midsection. Sad that I'm going to have to return it. Dang middle age spread!"
3.0,Well: it IS loose. Unflattering. Wrong fit.
3.0,"I was very excited to have a wallet that would match my purse, however this wallet is RED! I still gave it 3 stars, because it's well made, has great organization, and I am keeping it because my old wallet was falling apart, but I am seriously bummed about the color."
3.0,"Looks nice and it's more burgundy than red and same problem  I always run into, my boobs are to big for this type of outfit"
3.0,Heavy but beautiful
3.0,"Fit. was OK for me. Legs were snug, but in a good way so they shouldn't ride up too bad. Elastic is thin and cheap as are all the materials used.<br /><br />They are what they are but probably won't last you long."
3.0,"The style is good and very comfortable. However, the material for pockets is so fragile and pockets broke. I have to seam those pockets for the several shorts ordered for my son...."
3.0,"Not great quality, but what do you expect for the price. Nice color and size."
3.0,"Based on reviews I ordered down a size.  It fits OK, but i should have ordered my size as it isn't as slouchy as in the photo."
3.0,"When I received my hat it was not in its original form, it was all lopsided and I can’t get it back to it original form."
3.0,more see through than I'd like... but cute nonetheless
3.0,Was larger than a standard steering wheel. Had to add foam so it would fit. Didn't like that
3.0,"Way bigger than expected. I ordered a whole size down and still they are big. Lucky for me I happen to love cute socks and they work great with some knee thighs and slacks. Not the most comfortable but they are good enough I won't bother returning them. But be warned, order way down and try them on before you dispose of the packaging"
3.0,"Super cute and my 3 year old loves it! I gave 3 stars because i opened it and the item already had wear on the legs, like it’s been washed a few times.  It also is a little on the larger side for her but she is tall and thin."
3.0,"Kinda ugly, not nearly as bright as the photos. But I guess I'm just sour because I've gained too much weight to wear my gorgeous wedding ring and I'm sulking. A bit stretchy. I roll them off my finger and they haven't snapped so I'm not sure if the poster that mentioned they broke was being WAY to rough or whatever..."
3.0,We had it just barely a year when it began to tear away. Now it’s only getting worse. I wasn’t able to come into contact with anyone online or by phone. The number I did find I was told this wasn’t their product.
3.0,Smelled bad upon opening packing and was a little off in sizing
3.0,It was too big in the waist and shoulder neck area. Also being 5'2 it was a bit long in length
3.0,The waist is higher than pictured. The dress is cute just not what I expected
3.0,"It was not what I expected but it can work during cooler or cold weather. It can be worn during a holiday function due to the shinier material but if you know fashion it can be rocked in any setting. My waste is looser than I like with the Large, I'm a 31 in the waste and could have gotten a Medium."
3.0,"I took a chance and ordered this when there weren't any reviews. I ordered an XXL in green. I'm 5'3"" and 185lbs, I'm wearing 3 inch heels in the pictures. The top of the dress isn't lined and the skirt isn't fully lined just a small portion (as seen in the picture). You have to make sure it's pulled just right or it's noticeable. The color definitely isn't green, I compared it to a green shirt in one of the pictures. The fit was actually really good. You can adjust the baginess of the fit with the neck tie and the waist tie. It was a little tight on the hips when putting it on but was fine once on. Overall I'm surprised with this but will be returning because of the color."
3.0,"Not my favorite...I got a small, I wear a 2 and they are tight not much stretch, don’t love the material."
3.0,Everything is satisfactory big “BUT” is the zipper; IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ZIP IT SHUT!!! You’d need help to zip it up. The zipper strap is useless. The only way I can zip myself in is to figure out a way to have the zipper handle on a 45 degree. If you can’t zip this up by yourself then it’s completely useless. You won’t go surfing with the back open you might as well use a board shorts.
3.0,I like the swimsuit but the seams seemed to be tight and stretchs in a way that looks like it gonna rip apart.
3.0,has a weird line at the top of the striped part...still deciding if I want to keep it. I think it would be cute with a blazer over the top or something.
3.0,You can wear them only a few times before the elastic stretches out completely.
3.0,"Product fit alright but came with visible scratch on the lens that you can not miss. Who ever packaged it either he doesn’t pay attention and must work on that, or ignorant and doesn’t need to be there."
3.0,"The fabric is quality, but a little rough and stiff. The problem is the fit! They seem sized correctly but the cut is weird. The crotch is low, and the leg is short on me, and I must admit I’m have a long torso and short legs! The thighs are a little snug too.<br /><br />I do love all the pockets. I’m going to hope that these pants soften up with a couple washes and I’ll be happy to have them for lounging and housework, but they’re just not going to work for me out in the world."
3.0,I bought this top from another seller and it was made really well. I only bought this one from this seller because I saw that the “buttons” were silver and not gold like the other seller. When they mean lightweight they really mean it! 😂 This was so thin I could see everything through it. It was a dollar less then the other seller. I would rather pay the dollar more to get better quality! Very cheaply made. I don’t like posting negative reviews but this warranted one. The buttons are GOLD not silver and I purchased a large and it fit a little bigger than expected. The material is horrible. Lesson learned! For reference I am 151 lbs 36 DDD 5’3. I hope this helps in your decision to purchase this.
3.0,On someone you could see the excess glue but other then that great for the price!
3.0,"Beautiful skirt, the quilting is lovely. The sizing is way off. I am 5’10, 125lbs. The size chart put me into a small and I could hardly snap the waist, however, the hips had plenty of room."
3.0,They really cute. But the were difficult to to buckle one they were on. The buckle does not slide easily.
3.0,"Nice for warmer weather, do order up a size"
3.0,"Quality belt, difficult to figure out the assembly."
3.0,"Nice shape, ran a little big, the top lining shifted around while wearing it. Overall is is okay for the price."
3.0,It runs a bit small in my opinion and is VERY thin. Like a tshirt material.
3.0,So far it was a good experience if it continues to work.
3.0,Really cute but huge. I had to return. Not my style. But if you like big sunglasses you will love them because they are quality glasses.
3.0,It was small and the panties couldn’t be ordered a specific size
3.0,I feel like it shows to much figure instead of shaping the body. Comfy though.
3.0,"Little bit cheap feeling, but perfect as a swimsuit cover"
3.0,I ordered an XL for myself and received a size small. It’s not a bad quality dress but the elastic along the neckline fits very tight on my lean 13 year old in the size small and it was wrinkled so bad that we can’t even tell how the length fits yet.
3.0,"Ridiculously priced by Speidel.  I like the band though.  However, it does pinch your skin when you put it on or remove it."
3.0,Fit great all around. It was just too loose around the chest and the sleeves. Looked funky.
3.0,I honestly love how it looks on. I wish it didn’t hurts a little to put on because it is beautiful. I also don’t really like how it gets randomly loose. And I hate that I often loose it because it is really pretty but if u don’t mind loosing it just to match a cute outfit definitely get it!!
3.0,"The Shirt is not exactly as I thought it would feel (screen printed). The Size is spot on in the length and belly area. However, the sleeves are a bit longer and uneven. I'm still keeping the shirt....It's the CUBS!"
3.0,I didn't think these were as comfortable as other harem pants I have bought.  Was also very scratchy.  Hope they soften up when washed.
3.0,"this is a beautiful duster, the only this is the sleeves are super super long. I wore it for my maternity photo shoot at 30 weeks pregnant. I am 5'3"" ish and was about 175 at the time of the shoot."
3.0,"The dress itself is cute but was little too large.  I am 5'4&#34;, 119 lbs and purchased a small.  If you belt it, it would fit better but I found it too &#34;flowy&#34; for me."
3.0,"broke, but I fixed it.  Otherwise, it's super cute!"
3.0,It was very pretty.  But it ran too small for a 2x.
3.0,"For the amount I paid, its a good shirt. The inside of the shirt is not flannel. Feels like Polyester /cotton.  The label says 20% polyester so , it is what it is.  For flannel its not too thick and not too think.  I guess for thick 100% flannel I will need to pay more and just buy it where I normally do.  I'll wear it when I have to do yard work."
3.0,cute and good quality. does not fit to the right size
3.0,"I purchased this dress at my normal size, it did not fit. I believe these are sized smaller. Very beautiful dress. I recommend getting your exact measurements before purchasing."
3.0,Very hard to screw in. I still can't wear it.. Instead of the little ball screwing off the top like others do... You have to unscrew it from the middle ball right above the bow and it's way too difficult to screw on while in your naval....
3.0,Cute but does not fit like the pic at least for me it's probably 2 sizes too small. It fits but not loosely
3.0,"Stated it was a burgundy color, I’d call it more red. Quality seemed to be ok. But I’m returning due to not the color I was looking for."
3.0,The product was marginal and it was not what I expected.
3.0,Its nice but creppy
3.0,Uncomfortable... size is about half off
3.0,"overall fit was good, but tight at the breast."
3.0,Very pretty and well made. I have a large chest and the buttons gap. A larger size would certainly swim on me though.
3.0,I really wanted to like this but it was just too large. I ordered based off my measurements but I easily could have gone down a size or 2. Ended up returning it as it just didn't fit. Loved the look and material though.
3.0,iis ok
3.0,"Actually , It runs not too big..  I wear M but ordered L after read a few comments. I should have ordered M. Size runs normal. U don't need to order larger size to fit on u. Quality is ok."
3.0,"The first dress I ordered had a blue stain and didn’t fit (size medium). I had to return the dress and re-ordered it in a size large. This one didn’t have any stains! I’m 5’5” and a size 6, so the medium should have fit. If you have a slightly curvier lower half, definitely consider sizing up a size! Oveall, the dress is really cute and flattering. It has a loose and almost boxy shape. It hits around 4 inches above the knees, so you don’t have to worry about it riding up inappropriately."
3.0,"Love this band, the hoodie was just my size I got an XL. Please think about changing your material to be more soft & comfortable, I received a stiff thick hoodie with the seem breaking."
3.0,"Great color, very cheep material. It looks like a nightgown. I liked the length and the cut but I wish it was made of something other than nylon. I had to send it back because unless u want a gown to wear to bed in this really had no place in a lady's wordorbe. Return"
3.0,"I bought these to replace a pair I already owned, but my dog chewed. I thought they were exactly the same as they look very similar. I have very long nails so can only wear fingerless gloves. Unfortunately this pair is super tight! I can not wear them comfortably and will be giving them to my pre-teen niece. Except for the fit, they are nice gloves."
3.0,Looks as pictured but the material is not of quality.
3.0,"I loved this dress, but when I tried it on the top runs VERY small.  I usually get a small but ordered a medium just to be safe.  Even so the waist was fine, but the top was more like an XS.  The material was nice, hung well, looked nice.  Wish it had fit better!"
3.0,Used for theme park while it was raining. Work OK.
3.0,Daughter loved them but after a few days they started to fall apart the string around the horn came off but other than that their ok for the kids
3.0,"It’s horrible that they are 1/4” past the nose pads. So it’s in the line of sight. The clips should have been on the outer edge, away from the line of sight.  It’s a shame as the lenses fit my glasses exactly.  So disappointing."
3.0,"Vines are very attractive, but first time I wore then one came out and I lost it, so of course I can't buy just one, so it was wasted money!"
3.0,NICE BUT A LITTLE OVERPRICED
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, great price but much smaller than an extra large.  Fits like a medium to large."
3.0,"I wanted to love this suit. I’m 5’8” and this suit was very short in the torso; so much so that I felt like I was hunching over because the straps were pulling me down. The pads in the bust were bent as well, making a crease down the middle. I tried readjusting them, and they appeared permanently deformed. The material was thick, which helped hide lumps and bumps, but overall, the suit was not meant for someone of my height."
3.0,"I love the shoes, but the sizing is what i dont like. They run small and narrow. I have a wide foot so even if i decide to go a size higher, the front part will still be small, but the back will be loose. So if you have wide feet, I truly do not recommend these flats.They hurt so much from the front."
3.0,Cute and fits my daughter perfectly. Arrived faster than expected.
3.0,I love the fact that my ponytail fits through the back opening. And that it fits great. It protects my face from the sun.<br /> I hate that the hat came folded in a triangle and i cannot seem to get the crease out. When I wear it it’s floppy where the folded creases are. It isn’t crispy and perfect like in the picture.
3.0,They’re pretty small and made of cardboard. The feathers would fall off easily and by the end of the night one wing was missing just about all the feathers. Is pretty when it starts but not after only wearing for 4 hours.
3.0,"It fits a little small, and skirt isn't nearly as flaired as it looks in the pictures.  It's just ok.  For the price, it is what it is.  I wouldn't get it again."
3.0,Very flimsy material. Color is not pretty at all.
3.0,Love them however they fit a bit tight so you may want to consider ordering a size up! I’m  typically a size 4/6 I’m a bit hippy and the small fit extremely tight. These pants are nice so I will definitely purchase a med.
3.0,"This is the most comfortable watch band I had found, and it is by far my favorite. I loved the bands that came with the Moto 360 smart watch because it was this soft flexible leather. I had previously purchased the Moto 360 band for $30, so at this price this is a steal! The only downfall I can think of is with 2 bands running under the watch, it raises the watch off your arm a larger amount than a nylon NATO bands. I will gladly purchase these again!<br /><br />Updated 1/6<br />So I ordered a second one, and it was not as comfortable as the first. The band under the watchface has a rougher edge, irritating my skin. Also they didnt come with the pins ( I dont remember if the first band did). I specifically ordered this because 1 of my pins popped off and was lost."
3.0,I wish it came with a better and stronger way of putting it on a bracelet. I am a worried it might come off. Heres to hoping it doesn't.
3.0,Satchel.. thinking top handle can go over shoulder. But only a top handle with satchel strap. Love the look but disappointed
3.0,Smaller than expected? The back of the hoody is shorter than the front and it fits (feels) weird.
3.0,The thigh is to small from what the picture looks like. But for little skinny girls it would be fine it does look nice.
3.0,"This was the first I orders way to small was disapointed because it stated it was a size 14 normally Don't have issues when I buy dresses that size,hope the size chart will state that smaller then regular size"
3.0,"Very cute, but it is much smaller than a typical 2x. May need to order a size or two up from what you would normally wear."
3.0,I really like the dress the way it feels and fits!<br /> My problem is the floral color is not like what I ordered. I am keeping the dress just disappointed it's not the colors I chose. The dress I received has pumpkin color in it and picture did not.
3.0,Good quality but they run small!!  Order a size up..  nice colors and feel good
3.0,"I wanted to like these, but for me they had two major flaws. First, the back isn’t as ""closed"" as another pair of slippers I own, so they feel more like a flip-flop than a slipper when walking around (there is some closure, just not enough for me). Second, they feel too tight on my wide feet, and slippers to me are ALL about comfort. It’s a shame because they’re well made, the step is cushioned very well, and the price is right. This is a highly personal opinion: if you don’t have wide feet and don’t mind less coverage in the back, they are GREAT quality."
3.0,Soft and warm but tags on top and bottom are quite irritating. Who uses tags anyway?
3.0,"Super huge leg holes?! Otherwise these are a great shot, comfy but have a snap-button closure that might bust open if you eat too much. I was uncomfortable with the very short inseam, and the giant leg hole- a stiff breeze could show off my derriere."
3.0,it was longer which i wanted but the rib area was tight... also it was closed in the back with a couple of pieces of velcro... i had to wear a sweater with it
3.0,"It did what it was supposed to do, but barely! I had a Buttoneer years ago and it was much better made. The plastic pieces are really cheesy too!"
3.0,"A little too tight in the arm, also quite low cut. I will sometimes layer a camisole underneath, but again, the arm pinches a bit. It's a shame, otherwise it's a nice top."
3.0,The sweater is made well but it is so huge on me. I’m 5’5” 135 and got a small. I believe the pictures speak for themselves. It definitely doesn’t wear anything like the pictures.
3.0,"What can I say , it was like all the rest."
3.0,Only one of the three had the inner lining. The other two are just plain knit beanies with no soft fuzzy inside. And there doesnt seem to be a way to contact the seller about it.
3.0,I ordered these same bandanas a year ago. Those bandanas were screen printed. The paisley on these bandanas is already peeling after 3 washes.
3.0,Nice sweater but very loose in the stomach.
3.0,"The fabric is tissue paper thin and definitely won’t hold up to multiple wears. Other than that it fits nicely and looks super cute on. So if you’re not concerned about the cheap material and need a one time look, go for it. Just know it won’t hold up beyond 1 or 2 wears."
3.0,Good quality picture and fabric but it definitely doesn’t stay on my face. The war loops are very large
3.0,Cheap plastic.  Gave them away !<br />Bought some &#34;Cocoons &#34; and they are well worth the price.
3.0,The fit ran small. I would suggest anyone order a size up. I couldn’t because we got the biggest size.
3.0,"Crystal shattered two times. Keeps good time, nice looking watch, much better than a quartz watch it seemed as though I was constantly put a battery in the quartz watch. I love not having to do that with this watch. I had both winner watches for about a year or so before I bumped it on a door handle. I’ve done that before with other watches and had no more than just a small scratch. Although the crystal on this winner watch might break I’m still ordering another one just have to be more careful with it."
3.0,"Nice blouse, runs larger than expected. Order one size down."
3.0,"The shoes are easy to put on and the kids seem comfortable wearing them, running around on grass and going into the pool. However, the rubber sole is flat and does not curl up to the toe region. If your kids tend to drag their toes when walking, the shoes will start breaking up at the toe after the first wear. In our case, it would be better to get the meshy water shoes with rubber toe guard."
3.0,not the color shown. it comes in almost neon greenish yellow. it's a super ugly color and not pleated. the material is super soft though and it does fit nicely
3.0,These slippers were very nice but I couldn't wear them because they did not stay on my feet.
3.0,Looks cool but was only for one side need other side now to balance it out but overall I like them they are cool
3.0,"the turquoise was facing the back, cute if they were put together right :( waiting on a response for my return"
3.0,"Luv the dress, but super big...even for a big gurl!"
3.0,"I love all the pockets in this wallet, it perfectly fit everything, however it is giant. It BARELY fits in my purse, and whoever designed this wallet put little quotes all over it that would be cute if they made sense. A few quotes read &#34;you are happiness Bird. beautiful and been idea A peaceful life in the garden @ Shinzi Katoh&#34;, &#34;Hi Where are you going?&#34;, and &#34;Cheer up! That,s the way it goes It's not the end of the world It was very nice Seeing you again @Shinzi Catoh&#34;. I'm not kidding, these are real quotes on my wallet. And I wrote them down word for word, including capitalization and punctuation. So if that doesn't bother you, then it's a great and functional wallet!"
3.0,"Cool design, neat that it converts but not the best quality. I bought it for my daughter for school and I’m not sure if it will last the whole year."
3.0,"It fits but is a bit snug in the arm hole not returning because next size up will be to big every where else... It is doable hugest for comfort the arm holes needed to be just a bit bigger 1'4 to 1/2"" would do it... So needless to say it's not going on the dryer... Lol"
3.0,Very pretty dress but faded easily
3.0,Really love the socks for our baby but already had little holes in the toe stitching in two different socks after being worn twice and one time being washed. Usually don't have these problems with the Nike socks.
3.0,"These boots look so cool! They just weren't very comfortable. The material is almost like a plastic and very stiff. The boots were a little difficult to get on, and walking around in them made them rub on my thighs in an uncomfortable way. The thighs just fit but the calf area was too big and looked blousy. They were hot too. I think if you wore panty hose under them, they might be tolerable for some. I sure wish they felt better because they did look really cool!"
3.0,This runs a little small so at am having to buy a new one in only a few months. My daughter is a size 6-7 so I bought a 6x but it is too short and pulls up in the butt so I will need a new one.
3.0,These work ok.  See a little small for me to cover my ears completely.  Could be a little bigger and they would be awesome.
3.0,"I was expecting nude boots, but it's more a light pink color"
3.0,Only lasted a few wears before the fringe area started unraveling.
3.0,"Good fabric and quality. Just doesn’t seem to fit me right. Felt short and wide. Bought two different sizes and both didn’t seem to work. The length didn’t increase from S to M - just the bust. It’s hard for me to wear shorts with baggy underarm areas, if you don’t like that either, this shirt isn’t for you."
3.0,"They're cheaply made, but heavily polarized and work fine."
3.0,"I only use the silk one.  The white one had odd coloration like a misprint of design.  The rest are too heavy or thick.  The heavy/thick ones would be good for keeping warm, but I'm using this as a mask."
3.0,Not very fine quality but ok in a pinch and for on-stage.
3.0,Too sheer.  Sent it back.
3.0,"Shirt runs big. I’m a XS and it’s pretty big on me. Other wise pretty cute, too bad I can’t wear it"
3.0,Nice looking BUT Breaks easily ...
3.0,Nice looking but very hard to clean whenever I try just smudges the lenses
3.0,"The sets are so cute but they run really small, I’m usually a size small in everything but this was not stretchy enough to fit comfortably. I suggest ordering a size up especially if you have thicker thighs"
3.0,The little rubber things that hold the glasses on your nose fell off pretty quickly.
3.0,"After they get dirty they are not good for non slip. They are warm but not good for me, I slid down on the floor,"
3.0,"This shoe is cute, but fits a little large for a 6.5.  Usually a 6.5 would be either slightly tight or just right for me and these are loose.  No support whatsoever, so you wouldn't want to wear them if you have to walk or stand a lot during the day."
3.0,"I got this strap about 6 months ago. Good packaging, good comfort, extremely good quality for the price.<br />BUT it's color was somewhat lighter than the picture shows here. I pondered about returning it, but somehow ended up keeping it."
3.0,"The Buick Logo is embroidered and the stickers did come with it, but it fits kind of small."
3.0,"I like how the dress looks, and I like how the material feels.  The downside is that you need to have a perfect figure because any bulges will stand out. If not physically perfect, you can wear shapewear.  But as a summer dress, do you want to?"
3.0,Gave to wife as they were too small for size 13 foot
3.0,"I bought a small, I usually wear a medium/large in shirts and the size was still too big and too loose but I made it work. Cotton/silky fabric, very stretchy"
3.0,"Pretty sunglasses, but I bought two and both came very stretched out."
3.0,"Cute Necklace, unfortunately looks somewhat cheap due to the rhinestones in the big loop (which you can't see in the provided picture.  Also, the necklace broke immediately upon be opening the packaging as the chain is made with bendable metal.  This necklace is cute but very cheaply made which goes along with the price."
3.0,Well i bought this for my 9 year old child and they would not fit on her hair they would all ways side off. Well at least shes using it as a tool!😅
3.0,"This sweater is beautiful,  but a bit itchy, and I ordered a size up so it could be kinda big and slouchy, but it came smaller than expected so it doesn't fit me like how I expected. Overall I like the top, but I would suggest ordering a couple sizes up if you want the slouchy look"
3.0,"They are ok,too shiny"
3.0,"It is nice for the money. The back strap is a little thin, so don't expect a super supportive feel especially if you're larger in the chest. A few loose strings, but that's expected with the price. Aside from that, there is a faint but horrible fishy smell to the dress. I tried it on for about 10 minutes and my fiancé told me to take it off because of the smell. Hopefully that will be fixed with a quick wash! You can hand wash and line dry. If that doesnt resolve the issue, I would change the rating to 1 star."
3.0,Had to get alterations done<br />Really big
3.0,Returned because it ran small
3.0,"Nothing extraordinary about this facemask.  It is as comfortable as others that I currently have.  However, I wanted a black mask and this particular item was in stock and delivered promptly. Satisfied with the company."
3.0,The green is more of a faded army green. It is made of quality fabric though.
3.0,Product came with parts missing and the customer service is horrendous
3.0,"Snugly indeed because of its good adjustment strap.  But everytime I wake up in the morning, my eye snug slipped out of my head already."
3.0,Plastic casing is kind of cheesy.
3.0,"These were really great quality tights but I wore them once and the ripped almost immediately. I am 5'7'' and weigh 145, I was right in the middle of the Medium Tall size chart but they were so tight. I thought they would just stretch out on their own but they just didn't last. I think if they were the right size for me they would have been wonderful. Wish they had a bigger size."
3.0,"Greener when I'm the shadows, brighter blue in the light."
3.0,Runs small. Short in the torso. Good material. Soft to the touch.
3.0,Poor quality. Sighing is not gone properly and I can see the gum that was used to stick the bow. But works fine  Halloween.
3.0,"It really is a nice earring but I when I eceive it , thread were coming out of them and they are also crooked. I've try to fix them but they still crooked on my ears. I would love to order more colors but through a different seller because of these issues."
3.0,I like the style of the hat but the bill is too long and the top is too deep for my preference.
3.0,"I wear a 7 1/2 in all of my hats, but this one is too large, not even close to my size. I bought it to wear flying kites, my hobby, but it will blow off my head in a 5mph breeze. Stuffed it with a paper towel, but even so the band's design doesn't lend itself to getting much tighter."
3.0,A little fitted on top - lots of loose threads-
3.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in this tie and keep going back/forth about returning it instead of giving it to my partner as planned. It has a very large, visible weave and the rebel logo looks shoddy. Very poor quality and nothing about it seems to be made from &#34;silk&#34;. Came in a plastic sleeve floating loose in a licensed StarWars cardboard box from China but no tags on the item indicate it's genuine."
3.0,I got these for my daughter as part of her costume. They fit nicely and came right on time.
3.0,"cute, but broke after less then a month"
3.0,"Nice quality and super soft. However, I ordered these Thanksgiving weekend and we recieved them on Valentine's Day. The vendor responded quickly to my inquiries and returned the shipping fees. These run really small."
3.0,"Takes a few weeks to arrive BUT it’s worth the wait, they feel and fit perfect. Get one size bigger cause we fat in the States."
3.0,"The inside if very soft and yet supportive. They seem to be very durable. The toes of the sole seem to be a bit of a trip hazard.  Within 10 minutes of putting them on, one of the drawstrings broke, so i removed the other."
3.0,It’s ok but it wrinkles easily.
3.0,"This necklace is beautiful, a lovely addition to any woman;s wardrobe, especially if you do not perspire at all. Upon reading the description, I was unaware that the major part of the piece is made out of fabric, white at that! Since the entire piece is white, it is definitely a spring/summer necklace, so I imagine I will be able to wear it twice before it yellows from perspiration. Sadly, it's beautiful but impractical."
3.0,Runs small and there is no flexibility
3.0,"I have several pieces by this brand and I just don't like the fit/styling of most of them.  I got this with the matching joggers.  They are not the same material.  This is a sweatshirt that is fuzzy on the inside.  I do like the extended cuff on this but the rest of the sweatshirt is boxy so the balance is off.  Also, the interior of the hood has two bug seams running down the middle.  This is the part of the hood that is most visible since you're likely not going to wear it up most of the time.  I found the length awkward and overall, it looks dumpy on me - not in a slouchy oversized way but unflattering.  The quality seems good (the unsightly seams appear to be a style choice) but I just don't want to wear it."
3.0,Present disjointed area
3.0,Nice not great
3.0,"Pretty suit, but the booty was mis represented. Too small when I bent over, but everything else fit great. I normally wear xl tops, size 14 jeans. I wear 38b bra. The boob area would be accommodating for up to a heavy c."
3.0,Chain for necklace is really small.
3.0,I thought the product was a  little flimsy-- lacked quality
3.0,"Not sure what I'll wear this with!  It's way too  massive for the dress I planned on wearing it with.  The chain is extremely long even when clasped as short as possible.  Fortunately, it was reasonably priced."
3.0,It was very snug. It was also small for a 2x. It was very pretty though.
3.0,Had to give away this product after washing as it was too small. More for a young person.  I was attracted to the product because of the design. Was concerned that after washing the sparkles would come off which was not the case.
3.0,Looks inexpensive. I will not wear
3.0,Wasn’t as long as I would hope. Went great with my outfit.
3.0,Fabric is o.k. Have not washed it yet so no opinion on whether it does well. Construction of item is fair. I ordered one with the intention of ordering several more colors but I think I will pass. Other manufacturers in same price range that I have ordered on line are of much better quality.
3.0,Wanted to love it but looked a little potato sacky. Tried to belt it but it came out too wide on the hips. If I ordered a size down it would've been too tight
3.0,Order the next size up.  Runs very small.
3.0,"Flimsy,  cheap  but it's super cheap so who can argue."
3.0,"Mi nena es size 2 de zapatos y ordené talla 2 y le quedaron cómodas así que recomiendo elegir talla normal, me gustan porqué son fáciles de poner, el estilo es lindo y los cintillos cruzados las hacen lucir muy bonitas, lo único que no me gusta es que tienen apariencia delicada y realmente no sé si duren mucho, pero aún así están muy lindas y el color es lindo."
3.0,It’s nice but very thin material I would like it a bit thicker
3.0,"Thin, fits about 2 sizes too small"
3.0,Item was smaller and shorter than expected .
3.0,Smaller than most sweat shirts
3.0,Nice quality but order a few sizes larger. It runs on the small side.
3.0,It was way too small for me to wear.  I’m disappointed
3.0,It’s decent fabric for a light sweater but does run big and is definitely not white but cream. Returned as I needed white and it was too long on my 5’1” frame.
3.0,Heavy uncomfortable
3.0,I ordered this after seeing a Facebook friends family pictures wearing this dress. I think this may be one of those companies that sends different material/quality items sporadically. By this I mean you can both order the same listing and get semi different products. Mine was cheaply made and awkwardly shaped. Fit small in strange spots. I’d suggest not ordering.
3.0,"Really cute in front, but the cut-out is a lot larger than expected. The opening starts at the back of your bra."
3.0,Honestly kinda meh. They weren't awful but the big one had edges that dug into my skin and I had to smooth with a rotary tool. It also did not fit my neck so I had to cut a buckle hole for myself.
3.0,I thought it was going to made if bone. It feels more plastic that anything.
3.0,"After a few wears, the strength of the clips have worn down. Does not stay connected to shirt."
3.0,Super soft but not compression at all and VERY thin
3.0,"Nice dress but a little too matronly for me. I am 5’4 and 139 lbs. I ordered medium... I guess it fit as it should but was too long. I felt a little too puffy in it. I think it works look better on a thinner person, was not very flattering to me. The pattern was beautiful and looked good quality. I returned it. It’s hit or miss when clothes shopping on-line!"
3.0,"These looked good, until they broke a month later."
3.0,Does not give any lift as shown on the videos and not so comfortable
3.0,Eh. Way too short. I hated the feeling of the material. Gave them to PTA the same day I received them.
3.0,I like the design on each one but I lost everyone I put in.. it's hard to make it tighter once you put it on..
3.0,Very pretty. But there was no option to select size so I thought it was adjustable. It isn't and the ring was so small it fit my young daughter's hand instead of mine.
3.0,"i appreciate  your delivery time, it's ok, at time. the items are small than appears in the picture but I like it.<br />it encourages me to order again for the next time"
3.0,"Although there are hooks to hook onto a mask, it does not stay in place. It moves around under the mask and is not very comfortable. The concept is good, but the execution is poor."
3.0,"Returned this.  The face is very small, about 3/8&#34; x 3/4&#34;."
3.0,This did not last long. The metallic started to rub off as soon as I wore it
3.0,color different  wife like them any way
3.0,"So.... Describing the fit for this is challenging.  Some of the tanks were slightly too small, another too big. Really good for a breathable sport tank, but not all of them made confident to wear them out of the house."
3.0,"I specifically searched for 100% cotton boxer briefs. Two notes in description of these boxer briefs indicate100%. Underwear labeled on package and on garment 95% 5%. Why misrepresent the product. Other than that, they look reasonably well made, nothing exotic or fancy but for the price OK."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my little in my sorority. I thought it is cute but the ord it comes with is very cheap, you'll probably want to replace it with an actual chain. It's just as pictured so what you see is what you get. I was just hoping for slightly better quality."
3.0,"Shorter than expected, my daughter wears it over leggings"
3.0,I love the look of them but they are uncomfortable as all get out and the heel wears away really easy exposing the metal spike that eventually starts to make a squeking noise as you walk.
3.0,they felt like they were going to fall apart but they were really cute and i liked them
3.0,"Gorgeous color as shown, nice stretch in the material, fits great from the waist down and for arms.  BUT, the bust area is strangely large-- even with a cami underneath it would just hang!  Can't even just tack the v-neck closed because of all the extra material!  Does NOT fit as depicted on the model!"
3.0,"Not bad, little small"
3.0,I need a return labeled emailed yo me please. Closest ups office is an hour a way
3.0,"Fit well, but the drape is just not made for tig ol' bitties. Oh well.<br /><br />For reference, I wear a 32H (44""- 32""-42"")"
3.0,They were a little small :/
3.0,"I was advertised this item so much so, that I read the reviews, saw some duplicate photos and thought, if it doesn't work, I'll just return it. I bought this item in hopes to loose some weight in my waist and help my posture. Though it has a great hold at first, I can not sit down without this band moving around! I am about 5.7 290 tummy heavy. I wear a 22/24 or a XXL. I have had this band for a month almost and have only wrapped it once where it didn't move and I had on additional shapeware. If loose skin say after weight loss or after childbirth, even posture correction, I would recommend. But for seamless shaping for a tummy heavy plus size (apple or pear shaped) works great with additional shapeware, just don't think I should need to wear additional shapeware. Hope this helps."
3.0,This is much heavier than a normal t-shirt
3.0,"You wouldn't know from the 92 times 'Australia' or '100% Australian' or some like phrase is plastered all over the web ads and the box, or from the actual claim all Bogan products are made in Australia (off the mfr's website), but these boots are made in China.  I get annoyed when companies obviously go out of their way to be deceptive or ambiguous about where their product is made.  I don't expect everything to be made in the US, but be honest about it.<br />The slippers are of average quality.  Not nearly as nice as Uggs, but they are way cheaper.  The top of the slipper (that goes around your ankle) is a little tight getting them on.  Definitely order up at least a half size.<br />I won't be buying anything from Bogan again."
3.0,They are bigger than I thought they'd be.  But they are alright for a decent yet cheap pair.
3.0,This was a comfy jacket but was WAY too large for me. I returned it and bought another jacket instead.
3.0,Great fit and super cute color. Only downfall is the bottoms are see through
3.0,"Not the best, even for the price. But they'll work for my daughter's Halloween costume. Pretty small."
3.0,Top a little see through
3.0,Got this kit because I wanted pierce my bellybutton and see if I could really do it. Honestly I should have bought a different kit because the needles aren’t too sharp. They are sharp enough to pierce but you really have to work to push it through your skin and it hurts. It was a stop and go process for me and I ended up giving up because I couldn’t get it to go through the other end. Now I have to order different needles and try again.<br /><br />The belly ring is very pretty and I can’t wait to wear it. At the end of the day I just paid for the belly ring and waste time.
3.0,I ordered this in white and absolutely love it....but then ordered one in red thinking it would be 100% cotton but it wasn’t it was 65% cotton! I returned it and bought this one and it’s zero % cotton! I am very disappointed however I don’t want to take the time to return it again! Regardless of what it’s made of it’s a nice fitting T-shirt!
3.0,"Cute fabric, but you will need a bathing suit underneath for sure.  There is no coverage on the sides, where the model's hair is laying, and the length is very short compared to the image.  My dress hits about 4 inches above my knee. I am 5'8 and I bought a large."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this shirt. My baby girl is 18 pounds and I thought it would be perfect for her 1 year photos. Based on the size chart, I bought a 12 m. It's swallowing her in photos and the ends of the fabric in the neck area are really thick (moreso than normal shirts). The &#34;one&#34; part is so cute but I really wish I had selected another outfit for her photos.  Perhaps when she's 1 1/2, it will fit her."
3.0,The angled buttons are not angled enough to actually look intentional.  They look as if the dress is made badly.
3.0,"For the price, I won't complain and I will keep the dress, but there are issues.  First, the dress is way too short.  I bought it to wear to work but since it is so short, I will have to wear this as a kick-around dress with flat sandals. I am only 5'3&#34; so this should not be so short.  Second, the colors do not match the picture at all."
3.0,"It's a nice pewter pendant, did not exceed expectations in anyway.  It is sufficient, but nothing really special.  Would be better in a more expensive metal or with cut-outs maybe.  It looks exactly like the picture."
3.0,The sheets would not fit
3.0,"Fit my needs for an inexpensive lace shirt to give a long skirt a &#34;dress&#34; look.  The lace is not symmetrically stitched, however, so the shirt looks twisted when it is on.  Based on reviews I ordered a medium, but would have been happier with a large.  I have rather thin arms for my size (5'6&#34;, 145-150#, 37&#34;/29&#34;/40&#34;) and it was tight on my arms and very form fitting on my torso."
3.0,"I normally wear size 7 1/4 hats, I don't consider myself to have a large head; however, these beanies are tight on my head. I pulled it on and then flipped up the remaining material and it was squeezing my head to the point I felt a headache coming on. I'm hoping that they'll loosen up overtime, otherwise I may give them away to my kids or something.<br /><br />Other than the fit, they're very nice beanies. The material is lightweight and soft. I removed the tags easily with a seam-ripper because, as I mentioned, I planned on flipping the edge up."
3.0,"Cute and well made tassel charm, but the photo and description are deceiving. 6 tassels are shown and the description states it comes with 4. I thought I was receiving 4 units only to receive one. Returning product as I needed several and these were not cost effective. Clarifying the product description would be helpful to buyers."
3.0,Is soft and comfy but definitely runs large so order down. Color was perfect
3.0,Neckline is higher than expected but is ok. It is fine for another t-shirt
3.0,Very difficult to put on frame!
3.0,My son loved it but it doesn’t stay up on the his face
3.0,One of the shoes you have to slam to make it work
3.0,"I'm a size 14, 38F and ordered a XXXL. Fit through the bust and hips but the waist was MUCH too small. A shame as the posted measurements should have fit. Returning."
3.0,Too low rise for my liking. Also a bit too long for my 5’5” self.
3.0,"Happy to find this hear non Halloween season. I would liked it more if it was tagless, imprinted labels on actual fabric is preferred. Tags are itchy on the neck for most kids."
3.0,Much bigger and bulkier than I expected. My daughter asked for it but I don’t think she will end up liking it. It looks like a gumball machine item.
3.0,Order larger than your ring size
3.0,"Pretty pricey considering it was just a cheap, screen-printed graphic on a generic hoodie. I’ve been afraid that the image will wash off the sweater any day now."
3.0,Well they were already scratches on the watch so I don’t think very highly of it
3.0,There is nothing to hold it in place because it has two very slippery surfaces that cannot hold onto anything.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Felt cheap, but will do ok as an under shirt."
3.0,They are adorable and warm but way too large for my 6 month olds feet. The fall off immediately after putting them on
3.0,A little small and bunchy at the waist.
3.0,This dress is okay. Disappointed that I received the wrong color. Ordered red and received burgundy. Now the one I originally ordered is out of stock so there is no way to switch it. The dress fits nice so I’ll keep it. Just wish I had received the one I ordered.
3.0,"The fit of the body is nice, but the shoulder straps are very short. I am 5'8&#34; and 34C, and the v neck looks quite awkward with how high it sits on my chest. I will be lengthening the straps."
3.0,Cute set.  Shirt and shorts are a little on the short side.
3.0,Really small not a great quality material.
3.0,These earrings are too cute! I love the look. My only complaint is the fringe part slides around... ALOT!
3.0,Waste muy money.
3.0,the dress quality is great and color is very pretty.  however it was smaller than expected and too tight-fitted.  the bra and underwear silhouettes are visible... not sure how I will wear this dress.
3.0,kind of big on. Get a size smaller
3.0,great idea but it was hard if not impossible to remove the transparent strips from the adhering paper.  Would really love to hear<br />that this problem was resolved.
3.0,"As usual, I was really hoping that this would be the bra that finally fit in he way I would like a bra to fit: like a glove. I think you ladies understand what I mean by that. I, however, have never been able to find that bra. Bras are a big frustration for me. In fairness I must say that it's probably not the bra's fault or any bra I've tried. It's my problem. I am small busted. And I think that small-boobed women cannot find bras that fit. It's very frustrating. So if this bra interests you, give it a go. It has a good rating. So don't go by my experience."
3.0,"I am 5'4"" 225 lbs. I ordered the 2x and it fits bit is more snug than I like. Seems to have a spandex material that clings to the mid section. If you order...do a size up. It is a very beautiful vibrant colored top. I will be keeping mine. Just hope it doesn't shrink after the first wash and dry!"
3.0,It's a Christmas gift for someone in the office and it came in ripped from the back. Too late to order another one.<br />it is super cute though
3.0,Great material fantasticly stylish runs terribly small
3.0,Very poor screen printing.
3.0,Cute rings but some of the rings turned quickly
3.0,I'm only 5'4'' but this comes above my knees - and I don't like that.  I'm going to add lace or a layer of fabric.
3.0,I loved these but they lower rim is super thin and they broke just after the return window closed. I had the on my head and bumped them on the door jam of the car and they fell apart. Great look just be super careful with them.
3.0,"I love the color , wore it comfortable and warm"
3.0,"The fit and style of this dress was spot on. My only reason for not keeping it was the fabric. It's the soft jersey fabric that wrinkles so easily. it was covered in wrinkles from shipping and I've had similar clothes that were hard to wash/upkeep to avoid those wrinkles. Heads up as well, it shows everything. Panty line, buddah belly, etc. For the price, it is a good deal and would recommend for somewhat casual events. Not dressy enough for the event I was attending."
3.0,"These are pretty earrings.  Very ethnic.  They are a little large and a bit heavy--but not too bad.  But I've never seen earring fastenings made this way.  And it's terrible.  The earrings are unwearable because the wires are too thin and flimsy and they don't ""catch"" in the other side.  The wire is not quite long enough and the hold not set up deep enough or something.  The weight of the earring hanging from the wires--just pops the clasp open every time.  That's AFTER fighting for 5 minutes to get it in place once it's on your ear.<br />Epic fail on an otherwise lovely item."
3.0,Color faded really fast after one wash.its okay for the gym but would have rather paid more money for better quality
3.0,The color wasn't quite what I expected and it's not as deep as I thought it would be.  It's more shallow and tubular.  Kind of like a duffel.  It's ok but not really what I expected
3.0,Love the romper itself don't like design
3.0,All the other Ethica boxers I got were great- These were a little lower quality. They look super old after I’ve washed them a handful of times.
3.0,I wear a size US12 or 14..Bought an XL which usually fits a little  big/loose because that just how I like my clothes to fit. I love the material and  length however they run small...Definitely SIZE UP!!
3.0,"If your idea of impressing someone is taking them to Burger King and letting them buy off the dollar menu then this might be a perfect gift for you to give.  It's a very thin watch-- very thin--it's also got a BIG face.  Now thin doesn't mean cheap, quite the contrary, my Skagen watch is as thin or thinner but unlike this one the Skagen feels well made.  This seems like a prize you might get at a trade show for correctly guessing how much vinyl siding a typical house might need, and then your ""prize"" will be followed by endless calls from sales people.<br /><br />Cheap watch.  Feels like if you bumped it the whole thing would fly to pieces.<br />Not gift worthy unless you don't like the giftee and you want to send a message."
3.0,Dried  nicely
3.0,"The very first time I put on a pair of these socks, one of them developed a hole near the big toe where the line is stitched across the toes. The tops also curl down, even before you put them on for the first time. Also, the rubber cracks after one wash. These socks are cute, but cheap."
3.0,Poorer quality than expected. Size a little bigger than the cart size says
3.0,"The hoodies LOOK very cool; our two boys love Avengers and loved these hoodies.<br /><br />However, you should know the following:<br /><br />We order a smaller size that should fit 4T-5T and it was a little on the small side, but fit ok; sleeves just long enough amd length came just past the top of our son's pants.<br /><br />The larger size (to fit a 9yr old; size 8-10) was VERY small.  He can't even wear it because the sleeves are too short and the hoodies is too tight.  And this kid is very fit.<br />The 8-10 size is more like a 6-7.<br /><br />Also, the hoodies are VERY thin.<br />From the pictures, we thought they'd be nice, thick, warm hoodies.  But they are more like very light hoodies; only slightly heavier than a long sleeve t-shirt."
3.0,I do wished I would have read more reviews before purchasing. The product did come in very quickly though.
3.0,I bought this leopard bag and 2 others that claimed to be the same but looked different. This one and another one are smaller. For kids definitely. But not something I recommend to kids if they plan to use this for heavy stuff.
3.0,Too small for an XLarge
3.0,"I really enjoyed this beanie for about a month. A small hole developed in the top where it's all stitched together after daily use.<br /><br />Other than that, it looks very cool. Be aware, though, the crest of glittery. I couldn't see that in the picture when I ordered it, so I thought I warn you others out there.<br /><br />If you have a smallish head, get it.<br /><br />If you have a 7 3/4 size head like I do, find another."
3.0,I really enjoyed the size of the bag. It fits all the essential and the color is true to the picture. The only thing I disliked was the inside material of the bag. It feels like very cheap plastic that crinkles at any touch. It's also kind of thin but for the price I'm not complaining too much ill just make sure to check the description of the bag better.
3.0,the color looks different from the picture it's a dull color i thought it would be brighter
3.0,"I odered Large size because my chest is wide. It is 100% cotton. It looks not too bad on me, I like the design but the buttons are very weak. First time I wear it and 3 buttons were lost."
3.0,Very hard to get on and off!!
3.0,"They are beautiful and well crafted. We actually bought them to put in our dogs' hair since it's very fine, but they don't hold quite as tightly as I had hoped. The bow itself is perfect, but the clip is definitely meant for kids/animals who aren't going to move around as much."
3.0,"Unless you're willing to hem it, if you’re short and don’t wear heels, it’s too long.<br />I’m about 5’2 “."
3.0,"These are cute, but poorly made. The paint isn’t printed in the right spots and the color of the mushroom bleeds into the white stem on the bottom. Plus they are much bigger than anticipated. I thought they would be fine sized, more like quarter or even silver dollar coin sized. Still cute, just cheap which is fine for $2"
3.0,La calidad de la confección no es buena.
3.0,I have gotten about 4of your purses but this one the strap buckle is on the wrong side so I can't extend it all the way down to wear out as a over the head messenger type style
3.0,just a little to small.
3.0,These were the exact color shown on the website. I ordered a small. I should have ordered an extra small: I returned the item and received to resistance in doing so. I did not order the proper size because the leggings showed my cellulite. I love the cold. They are not see though but they show my imperfections.
3.0,"Cute, bought for a 3 day music festival but ripped within a few days."
3.0,"Very cute top, but runs small. I order an X-Large and ended up giving it to my 16 yo because it was a tad too small on me. It fit her perfectly and she usually wears a medium."
3.0,Did not lay straight. The hoops were lopsided.
3.0,"This dress is cute, but it stretched too much over my chest and lost the smocking."
3.0,"This is just ok, it works to touch up small pieces if your in a hurry and don't have time to use polish.  It does an ok job at cleaning but for the price I expected better.  The cloth gets blackened easily so I don't know how much use you can get out of one.  I prefer Wrights Polish cream better, it gets silver to sparkle like there is no tomorrow.<br /><br />I only recommend this for a quick on the go cleaner for small items.  Too small for platter etc.<br /><br />Otherwise go for the cream:  http://www.amazon.com/Weiman-Products-014-Silver-Cream/dp/B000BQYGWG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1407098178&sr=8-2&keywords=wright+silver+cream+polish<br /><br />I hope this helps, Cheers and Vidimo Se!"
3.0,Arrived in time but the band is fading already after wearing it for a week.
3.0,Okay only
3.0,It says 10mm but its actually 8mm so it’s gonna be small.
3.0,The length of the leggings is perfect but I feel like I’m the crouch area it looks so weird and I notice that I constantly have to keep pulling them up in order for them to look good
3.0,It’s tiny but ok
3.0,"I was super excited about these adorable frames, but sadly they broke after one day of wear and I was super careful. They broke while i was just driving down the road!!"
3.0,"These gloves are lightweight, not for really cold weather. When it's really cold out I can feel the cold seeping through the material. The finger flap is great when walking my dogs and I need to pick up their poop without needing to take off the gloves. The thumb flap part is not so great. Nice to be able to access my thumbs but they are hard to keep in the on position. I need to hold my thumb pressed against my palm or they pop off. I'm happy I bought them but they need tweaking to be really good."
3.0,"It runs tight, so I suggest sizing up at least one size if you want it to be flown like in the picture."
3.0,Size L: The shirt is a crop style and the shorts are on the longer side.
3.0,"Cute dress, fabric was just a little thinner than expected. Light and airy, but didn't like how you could see outline of any undergarment."
3.0,"Cute dress, but designed for a person with smaller bust and longer waist than me."
3.0,The material is comfortable and perfect for stretching in class. My issue was the top kept folding down and the pants are extremely long. I would recommend sizing down.
3.0,It was cute but broke the second time I wore it. I am not sure how but the pendant just disconnected from the rest of the choker and I was not handling it roughly. I guess it's just poorly made. Wouldn't recommend to a friend.
3.0,These are so very beautiful..they have a great shine however these should not be worn every day or they start to develop a greenish hue and will also turn your ears green which can be resolved by rubbing alcohol on your ears..theyre great for occasional wear as with most costume jewelry..i would not recommend these for people with sensitive skin
3.0,Simply to small
3.0,Had to return it. These run very small<br />The dress itself is very nice.
3.0,"The watch is doing it job, but really difficult to initially set. It would be better if the watch voice was a female."
3.0,I liked the idea of removable hood but the  zipper broke and couldn’t zip it closed anymore so I sewed it in. Bad and flimsy zipper.
3.0,It's ok...not wow
3.0,The straps are wider than most styles. The cups came higher than expected under the arm. The cups are wide at bottom and flatter at top. Fits large around ribs
3.0,"The size is off by one or two sizes, I bought an xl and the shirt fits like a med. The colour is just like the photo the material is sort of like a sports top, slippery."
3.0,"The shirt was like the other pictures but I feel like the picture on the model made it seem like it was a little more soft than it it.  The fabric is a little stiff. It's also more thick than expected. I have a longer torso so I felt it could be longer. It was fine, it just didn't live up to expectations."
3.0,Could be a little filtered.
3.0,"There were two rips.. One in the crotch seam and one by the left knee seam. As well as one of the button holes wasn't sewn correctly so the button doesn't go through where the hole should be. Luckily, I'm crafty and sew so it's easy for me to do it myself but as a product I bought as &#34;brand new,&#34; I shouldn't have to fix any of it.<br /><br />The hood doesn't stay on well either, if you're tall.. If you sit still, the hood stays on..."
3.0,The quality seems nice but I probably won't even use its so small.
3.0,Why does almost every season have subtitles?? I don’t like that at all.
3.0,"After FIRST washing, pants shrunk a complete size! Wrinkling is also a challenge. Fabric does not remain soft, so after washing, fabric is hard and very wrinkled!"
3.0,"They're a little small for my head, but the hinges allow the arms to swing out. Comfortable. They are indeed polarized. If you look at the photos, you can see how when straight, they're clear, but rotated, It blocks the polarized light from the laptop screen"
3.0,"I work in an office at a computer all day, the ofdixe managers think we are popsickles and keeps us very chilly. These cords aren't very long so if you have a desk you need to move around a bit they are annoying. The fit is great for me I'm currently 170lbs, but my hands are also small. The heat these put off is from a small pad that would sit on the top of your hands. These gloves take about 30 mins to warm up to the point you can notice, and even that is not very noticable, but it helps. The gloves are comfy, cute, and help you warm up the way any other gloves would, but are wonderful for typing. These seem hit or miss in reviews, so I guess try your luck?"
3.0,"The shoes are super cute but they are made of HARD molded plastic, both the sole and the top part and it’s painful to wear. Both my girls have narrow feet but these slides causes major blisters to due to the rigid plastic design of the slide.<br /><br />The soles are also made of molded plastic making it hard to wear. Do not recommend"
3.0,The sizing is just impossible. Order larger than you expect to use. Quality seemed good though. Only reason I gave it three stars instead of one. Will have to save these for another child.
3.0,Misshaped
3.0,"same size as the others I bought, but seems a bit too big"
3.0,"For the price, this is just fine, but it's certainly nothing to brag about.  It's showing its wear already (and I've only worn it 3 or 4 times).  Also, on mine, the tongue part (the end that goes through the buckle) is a little snug going through the loops next to the buckle."
3.0,Nice watch. Keeps good time but the luminous dial is useless because you can't see the hour hand and it doesn't stay bright enough to read anything for more than ten minutes. With the cutout center of the dial it is difficult to see the hour hand even in good light. I would suggest that the manufacturer make the luminous dial cover the entire front face. The movement is still visible through the crystal on the back.
3.0,"The instructions were difficult to follow.  The pieces were not lettered but the instructions were.  The wood split when I screwed it together so I used a lot of glue.  The supplier contacted me regarding my problems and was gracious enough to offer to reimburse me for half the cost because of the difficulty I had, which is why I gave it three stars.  Nice design, looks good and saves space, just needs to be a little sturdier."
3.0,"I really don't understand why these have so many great reviews. I've now tried 2 different colors, one in a size large and one in a size medium, and neither of them were squat proof. I first purchased the color TM-FYP41-WNE in a size Large, which is what the size chart suggested for me based on my measurements. I've gained some weight recently and am now a pretty solid large based on measurements (but it really depends on the bottoms) and I wear a size 8 in jeans. They were a BEAUTIFUL color and pretty comfortable, but they were baggy in two areas (crotch area and behind the knees)...and on top of that, they still somehow managed to turn pretty sheer when I bent over. I will say that it probably wouldn't be too bad if you wore nude underwear, but if you don't, you will see them. I could even see a few of my larger freckles through the pants when I bent over.<br />I returned those and eventually ended up deciding to try another pair in a medium, hoping the issues I had were based on the color I'd gotten. This time I purchased the color TM-FYP41-RED in a size Medium, as there were a few reviews on that color that claimed they weren't see through. However, while this pair fit me perfectly (not too tight, just right), they were still sheer when I bent over. Again, I could wear nude underwear and could then avoid seeing them, but again, I could see freckles. I'm on the fence about keeping these since they fit really well and I do love the color, but if I do, I'd only be wearing them casually or for upper-body days. There is NO way I'm squatting in these with other people around to see the results.<br />Also, keep in mind that these pants DO have that thin band of elastic running along the top of the waistband, which can give even the most fit of girls some muffin-top.<br />Overall, if you don't mind the fact that they aren't opaque, I would recommend either sizing down or going with the smaller size if you're normally in-between. As I said, the measurements put me as a large but a medium was what fit me best. I have an hourglass shape, but with my recent weight gain, my waist is not very small (around 31&#34;), so that should tell you something about the fit."
3.0,"Judged on its own merit, this is a decent product and works fine with thinner straps.  Medium-thick straps will press on the metal bars which operate the lock and you won't be able to close it (or if you do manage to close it, it makes it very difficult to open it).  Thicker straps won't even fit in it.  When (inevitably) compared to the original Omega clasp, the material and workmanship (and fit) do not even come close.  On the other hand, the original Omega clasp costs ridiculous 26 times more than this one..."
3.0,These were decent although the nose piece was small for my face. They didn't work well for me personally.
3.0,"The bathing suit is so cute, but the bottoms are a little too small for me. The top was adorable but you can see the padding right through the top. Luckily, I didn't really care but others pointed it out to me. Great if you're in need of a quick fix for a suit."
3.0,"So when I ordered there was no place to select a size. After reading the reviews that say some women with larger breasts than me were ordering and saying that they fit great, I went ahead and ordered in White and black. They came quicker than expected but It was so small I could barely stretch it on. I am 5'6, 145 lbs, and wear a 36C. I am also very fit, but If a sports bra makes me look like I have biscuts bulging from a can then I don't wear it and would say that it's way to small! If there were sizes I would order again just in a bigger size, but there isn't so I won't order again. And since I only paid 3.50 it's not worth returning."
3.0,"My granddaughter LOVED it, but after a week the horse came out of it"
3.0,"Pros:<br />- The color of the skirt was beautiful<br />- The length was perfect<br /><br />Cons (disclaimer: these aren't things that are wrong with the skirt, they were just wrong for me):<br />- The fabric is really thin and crepey. It has a lining and isn't see through, moves nicely, but I wanted something a little heavier for fall, winter, and spring. It also seems like it would wrinkle at the slightest touch.<br />- The tie is not attached. Being that the fabric itself is a slippery kind of textile I can't imagine this staying in one place all day.<br />- The large did fit me (I wear 12-14 in pants), but if I were going to try it again, I'd order an XL. I tried it at my natural waist and it gave me a bizarre little muffin top that I can't get behind.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice skirt, especially for lighter weather or special occasions, but it just wasn't what I was looking for. I was hoping for a sturdy, all seasons, vintage style skirt and this just wasn't it for me."
3.0,"I like the flexibility and type of hook, but I find the key ring a bit awkward in size. Also, I had to put super glue on one of the edges because it was loose.. Some of the marks on Snoopy were not well-defined. It is cute but not worth the price."
3.0,"It's lightweight, great fit, and folds up really small, which is great to get in my son's backpack for camp.  I also really liked the red color.  Don't think it repels water super well, so if you're looking for something completely waterproof, this isn't it.  It also absorbed some water and since we didn't wash it immediately, got some mold stains on it. That could have been our fault, but I wasn't expecting that from a coat that should repel rain."
3.0,This shirt makes me look bulky.  My body type is curvy.
3.0,"The gloves are well made and comfortable, but the fingers are over 1/2 inch too long.  I have small hands, but have been able in the past to get gloves that fit.  Stores don't seem to stock anything smaller than size 7, which is why I bought the 6 1/2 online.  I find that size 6 is too tight, although the fingers usually fit."
3.0,My girlfriend loves it but the chain it came with was fragile and broke after two days from wearing it.
3.0,Wanted to like this but the size was way too small and not for me.
3.0,Hair gets caught in the sequins some but otherwise it's good.
3.0,I liked the bracelet but very flimsy
3.0,"It wasn't was what I was expecting, but, I'll make it work."
3.0,I'm about 6'0 so a onsie is a challenge for me. I was initially hoping this was a two piece set but I'm okay with keeping the onsie.<br /><br />My main complaint is that its hard to put your arms through. Taking it on and off is not fun.<br /><br />The colors are true to the image and the material is very nice and thick. I would recommend for average height people. For my tall friends maybe try a two piece set.
3.0,Necesito dos  talla más grande
3.0,Looks good on the computer but looks very very cheap and person
3.0,"In the photo the sweater coat appears to be winter white, the color is claimed to be beige, and on the label of the garment it says to be cream. This item does not match the color in the photo at all, it a yellowish cream. Very disappointing. I love the texture, quality and feel of the knit. The only color photo I would trust is the black the rest may not be true. I will be returning this."
3.0,Great looking bracelet! It just falls off easily
3.0,Perfect for a Halloween costume. Lower quality but fit my needs.
3.0,"The zipper isn’t smooth and gets stuck often. The strap is also rather stiff. Looks nice, and holds a lot of stuff: Small wallet, phone, Type 1 diabetic supplies, and plenty of room left over."
3.0,"Beautiful dress but too big on the top and too small lower or waist area kind of weird looking, I have to fix it!"
3.0,"cheap material  can barely see the writing, piss poor work."
3.0,"nice organizer, but seems heavier than to needs to be."
3.0,"I purchased the gold tone purse for a dressy occasion. This is a classy purse and the size was perfect for my small frame.  However, the inside had a very strong smell which took quite awhile to go away.  I found it necessary to spray with an odor remover and air out for about a week."
3.0,Im a 36 DD and the XL did not cover well. Warning!
3.0,"Had to return these.  I bought them for my dad, but they don't have a fly!!!"
3.0,Zipper bother a little the skin
3.0,Super cute but the fringe unraveled the same day I had to burn the ends
3.0,"I loved the material and the pattern. Well made. The arms were too snug for me. I am between an XL and XXL in tops, trending to XXL with chiffon. I could get my arms in and move them around (the shoulder width was fine) but there was no flow or movement. And the body was about 3 inches shy of what I would have wanted. Sadly this is a return."
3.0,Fits a little different also.
3.0,"This shoe looks great but I am disappointed in the width. I ordered a wide width. The box said wide on the outside and there was a sticker on the bottom of each shoe that said wide but the inside label doesn't say wide. These shoes are clearly not wide. At least not typical Clark wide size. In fact I have since found this shoe on another website and it says the shoe is available in D width and 2E. Wide widths are typically 4E, not 2E. The shoe is comfortable once it is on my feet but since its not a true wide fit, I have to untie and tie each shoe when I put them on instead of just being able to slip into the tied shoes using a shoehorn. If you don't have a need for a wide fit, this is a great shoe however."
3.0,"I love the look, the feel, the pattern! The only downside is that my boobs are coming out because of the small cup and the way it's made! I don't want to return it because I love everything else but I don't know if I want to risk a wardrobe malfunction while wearing it !"
3.0,strap tore off after 3 weeks of use!  do love the colors
3.0,They are great quality but couldn't get them to work for us. Possibly operator error
3.0,"This green polka dot midi was something I was really looking forward too and it's a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I'll wear it and keep it, but it feels a bit cheap. The material is the type that elnds to static which can be really frustrating, but not a huge deal. The weirdest piece is that the stretchy band is not sown to the skirt so when you stretch it to put it on, the band can twist on the inside which looks pretty funky. It'll be good for layering but my fave, it is not.<br />The brown bag and clothing rack were amazon purchases that I liked and have reviewed!"
3.0,Not as I expected but I will use them in the future or another occasion.
3.0,Thin material but I can get over that. The thing that really bothers me is that the colors on the two sizes I bought do not match. One is slightly greener. It’s tough to see in my photo but in a professional photo shoot it will be obvious.
3.0,"I ordered my size, and it came in not fitting me- it fits my daughters fingers-Either I didn't get the correct size or they run extremely small."
3.0,Beautiful Charm.  I could not find a 14K stamp anywhere on it.  My wife is now questioning the authenticity.
3.0,So I was really excited about this bra and even really liked it before I left the house. I live in Florida and the walk from the car to inside Target was enough for me to sweat enough for it to come off and had to buy something else to wear before I left. I would like to wash it and try again and hope the boob sweat wont be so bad. Will update once I do.
3.0,This dress is very thin.  Casual not special occasion material.
3.0,"I love the top, but the armholes are a bit big so boobs show on the sides.  Otherwise I really like the top.  The bottoms are a bit short for my size and show underbottom.  Otherwise I really like."
3.0,"Pretty dress but I got the wrong size. If you’re between medium and large like me, go medium. The large was like a sack."
3.0,I just don't like the material.
3.0,"When they arrived I noticed that the small/medium is designed to fit women with a size 7 or larger shoe size. I wear size 6, so while they are very snug in the calf area, the foot area is too large for me, especially around my toes.  I can't imagine how they fit if one wears a size 5. The description in the ""Fit"" section on the page actually indicates that they run small, so order a larger size!"
3.0,Way to expensive
3.0,very simple to carry light and great for work and everyday used.
3.0,These things shrink - buy them big
3.0,I wanted to wear this as a summer dress but it was just too sheer and short. My butt cheeks are dangerously close to popping out! I use as a bathing suit cover instead
3.0,somewhat small and flimsy but ok for the price
3.0,"These rings are fine. Their resilience isn’t great though - originally loved them, however I went from having 8 different colored rings to 3 orange rings, 2 black rings, 2 white rings, and a blue ring in a couple months due to the outside color wearing off. If you are going to go with this brand I would opt for the packs that have the same color inside and outside to reduce the wearing off of the outside color."
3.0,comfortable; but if your shoe size is 13 or higher they may be a bit tight.
3.0,Really good price but poor material
3.0,"Runs pretty large, I typically wear somewhere between XL and xxl, I found out how big this brand runs on a previous purchase, they are nice looking shirts once u get the size right, 3 stars because there are alot of strands hanging that weren't cut and size runs large"
3.0,pretty cheap. pretty small. gave to my teenage sister.
3.0,While it is a nice sweater the workmanship is poor. I worn this sweater a couple of times and have noticed the thread is coming apart. I just could believe that was happening on a sweater that wasn’t cheap to buy. Nice time I only buy name brand sweater. I don’t recommend this sweater don’t buy
3.0,"The outift looks so nice in the picture but I guess you get what you paid for, it was ok."
3.0,"This is a Christmas gift but I was a bit disappointed when I opened the package to wrap it for my daughter.  The photo on Amazon looks plusher than they actual item.  I'm gifting this as my daughter asked for this item, but I would not have purchased it had I seen it first."
3.0,The butt cheek holes are a little awkward because the holes are really big but other than that everything else fits nicely
3.0,"THIS RING IS VERY DURABLE BUT i WAS DISSAPOINTED THAT THE DESIGN WAS NOT MORE VISIBLE,  MY HUSBAND WAS HAPPY WITH IT AND I GUESS STHATS ALL THAT MATTERS."
3.0,"The title of this review sums it up: watch band is of good quality and can be expected to last for some time, but overpriced by far."
3.0,Color listed as purple turned out to be burgundy
3.0,Disappointed about how poorly it was made and the quality of the workmanship. Purchased another and had the same problem.
3.0,"I was hoping for more, but for the price these are nice enough briefs.  I ordered XL, but these definitely run small.  I would go one or two sizes up from what you normally wear.  The fabric is soft and nice enough.  The biggest issue is the length in the legs.  They are too short and ride up in the crotch area pretty quick.  Things definitely get tight."
3.0,"These socks are really tough,meaning i could walk on concrete ALOT without tearing a hole in the socks,but the annoying thing was since they were to small(they barely covered my ankles), when i was wearing them with shoes on, the socks would constantly keep falling until they eventually ended up under the arch of my foot when walking for 2-3 minutes. Im a size 10 1/2 wide, so if you are a size 9 and under, these socks could be perfect for you"
3.0,"The boot puller is more flexible than I expected it to be. It does work, just not sure how long it will last with the flexing. I was just expecting something more rigid."
3.0,"Purchased the 2-4T for my average height/weight three year old. Leg openings are huge, the piping puckers and gaps."
3.0,"I love this earring, but I just have trouble adjusting it to my ear! It's a great material and also a great look to it, but it's a little tricky to adjust!"
3.0,"i got this back in march, wore it once. i went to wear it the other day and the zipper broke. and i mean like it split and when i attempted to get out of it to see if i could fix it, it got even worse. i thought i was going to have to cut myself out of it.<br />i'm currently in the processes of seeing if i can fix the zipper ( or buy a new zipper) becasue i really liked this skirt, it fits me pretty well. it just sucks that i was only able to wear it one time before it crapping out"
3.0,Cute. But bigger than I expected and didn't work for my needs.
3.0,"The material is soft and the color is as pictured.  The sizing was good.  It fits.  But I feel like the length is off.  Like this would be better for a petite person.  I'm 5'7"" and the sleeves and legs seemed a bit short."
3.0,It was made pretty cheap and not something I will probably not wear . Gave to grandkids to play dress up
3.0,The shirt looks great but the fit is too small. Not true to size.
3.0,"For the price this is a nice piece of jewelry - it has brass chain, a little too long but I can shorten it. The butterfly is quite nicely painted.  I like it."
3.0,Even the small size is way too big for my 10 year old. They do not look very Harry Potterish because they are so big.
3.0,I order these as a gift for my spouse so I made sure I had her size correct. She could barely get them in; the flare is too big. I ended up sanding them down with a Dremel and she was finally able to wear them comfortably.
3.0,"Not extremely high quality,  but I'm using it for a costume and it gets the job done. It's also nice to have for future costumes (witch.)<br />I'm waiting to try the vampire teeth for Halloween! Will update how it turned out.<br /><br />Update! The teeth didn't work at all. They kept falling out. I couldn't be a vampire like I wanted to because of it which was disappointing because no one understood my costume.  😔"
3.0,Hopefully my rating will go up after an exchange process but ....<br />The watch looks really nice and all but i cant get it to work<br />The light doesnt work and the buttons wont let me even get to setting it up...
3.0,"Okay, so it’s super cute, but it’s not nearly as long as in the picture. I ordered a medium instead of a small based on the reviews & it barely hits the top of my pants, but the sleeves are too big. It’s cute though, so I’ll keep it. It’s also pretty thin...definitely wouldn’t call it a cardigan."
3.0,"Very nice,  Looks great, however... I have only had it... maybe 2 months and the rose gold tones have just about ALL worm off.  But, I expected that, so I am ok with it.  It is sturdy and looks nice anyhow."
3.0,"I'm a medium size (more of a small/medium), and purchased a medium, but runs small. It's too tight, especially around the arms. The white is an ivory. I still need it, so returning for a large size."
3.0,Fit as expected prior to washing. Shrunk a bit so be sure to size up.
3.0,They were fantastic.
3.0,The shirt is so cute but I ordered a lg and it is more like a small.
3.0,It was broken when it arrived. I didn’t get to really use it. Disappointed.
3.0,"Nice product, except the second sentence did not begin with a capital letter. I was giving this to a teammate, so no big deal. However, very unprofessional if this is given as a retirement or work gift."
3.0,It had a hole in the sleeve when it arrived. I sewed it myself as i needed it for an event. Otherwise it is pretty cute
3.0,The color is off. The dress in the picture is more fall with the primary color being purple. The dress I received is Pink. It screams Spring. But the reason for me ordering is the nice fall pallet. But I guess I'll keep it. It's cute not what I ordered based on image.
3.0,"The bracelet and heart are nice, but the mother daughter print is off-center and seems a bit cheap looking.  I would almost want to remove the mother daughter wording and wear it as just a bracelet with a heart.  Other than that it’s a nice looking bracelet."
3.0,"Would be better for small ears, they don't close correctly on my ears."
3.0,I really like the look of this necklace but unfortunately there were multiple wires sticking out poking my neck. Cheaply made. But still a nice look.
3.0,"Ordered and received a L/XL.  There was nothing XL about it. Other than that, it seemed to be of good quality, I laundered it before my husband tried it on as he has severe skin contact chemical allergies. Will have to keep it and fins some one to give it to."
3.0,"These seem to be of decent quality, but basically fit one regular shoe per bag. Flip-flops or sandals fit ok together in a single bag, running shoes or high heels, forget it. I also thought the bag was supposed to be stretchy, but it didn't have that much give."
3.0,"cheap made, but ok for price"
3.0,Pretty Dress 👗 Okay Quality. The fit was very tight in the chest! I would recommend ordering one size larger than you normally wear.
3.0,"The scarf is very pretty and the material is soft, BUT it sheds like crazy."
3.0,Quality seems OK.  Print is well done.  Shirts seem to run one size small.  Suggest ordering one size larger than you typically order.
3.0,"Purchased 2 pairs of these to have for travel so if I end up loosing a pair I have a back up and not out the money for the price of higher priced name brands.The Good- Packaged well, Light weight, Fit well, Lens are darker than other gas station cheepies but not too dark to be a problem if your in a heavy shade or under a covered area. The Bad- On the inside of 1 pair on the right lens has a run/drip in the coating that's right in the line of sight so it makes things blurry like looking through water. Will return the bad pair and see how the other holds up."
3.0,Has a slightly different look in person. The sheen details are not as pronounced as in the photos.
3.0,"They run a bit small, but otherwise nice"
3.0,"it's nice, flowy, good material - I could have gone with the smaller size but it kind of works anyway, I like it."
3.0,"Tiny, like what was expected. Wished there was a Little More detailing though"
3.0,Larger and longer than expected. Very nice print but didn't fit me well. I wear a size 12 and ordered a size large. I'm 5&#34;1 and the dress was too long for my frame. Brown leopard print was unfortunately too bold for me.
3.0,"I got the apricot with pink roses dress in size S. I’m 120 lbs 5’3. The fabric is very smooth and nice to the touch. The hemline is just right. Waist hugs you perfectly. The spaghetti straps are adjustable. However the armpit and chest region is too loose. It wrinkles on the sides. I tried tightening the shoulder straps and also pin the chest area together with a small pin but it still doesn’t look right. Armpit still sags. It’s also hard to see the ruffles and bow with this kind of print. I suggest the manufacturers to use a different print or solid colors so you can see the pretty ruffles better. I really want to keep this dress because it’s so cute, but it just doesn’t fit."
3.0,Great item for the bike. Easy to install.
3.0,"The pearls are beautiful but the wires are extremely flimsy and will not last without being very careful, dissappointed the the wire quality, surely these could have been stronger for such nice pearls."
3.0,"I like the fact that the lens look continuous from the outside, but the bifocal doesn't work for me."
3.0,Order size up for size
3.0,I ordered an XL based on size chart. (usually wear a medium or large) The XL fit like a small so I am returning.
3.0,"When I first got this necklace, I was sort of skeptical because it looked cheap. However, it did not look cheap ON. It looked dainty and the moonstone was bright. It was subtle yet eye-catching and I got tons of compliments. Basically, it was my go-to necklace. Despite taking great care to keep it away from moisture, perfume etc. the plating wore off very quickly and today it is a sad little tarnished piece of junk. If it was real rose gold, I would buy it in a heartbeat despite the necessary price hike."
3.0,"Light weight and ok, but not for me."
3.0,"I like the hat, it fits good but the bax it was shipped in was smashed at beat up, so therefore the hat was smashed."
3.0,"Small on face, light wieght, but does the job covering wind flow most of time. Not ideal other than when riding. Good value"
3.0,The version of what came had basically no black at all it was just a plain light tan. I get that Each piece will be individual however it doesn’t resemble the photo or product at all not having any black in it at all. Won’t work for what I need at this point I guess I’ll just be regifting it at Christmas instead of using it for myself. I love Mya bags and have several Their purses and I’m in love with each of them so this is the first thing I’ve ever gotten that has been disappointing
3.0,Felt more like a neglegie than a dress.
3.0,"Not my best choice in sleep wear.<br /><br />The top fits tight when I prefer loose though I can say the bottoms fit perfectly. The fabric tends to ball after the third washing which irritated me.<br /><br />Plus, the material picks up everything. If you are a hand washer and don't have pets you might like them. They are of a cute design."
3.0,The sleeves don’t match the torso’s length so my arms don’t look like they fit. Overall it was pretty small so if you’re a medium definitely get a large if you want that oversized look. Material is thin so it is pretty see through…for $13 I’ll still get some use out of it though.
3.0,This looks like a good product overall. I am returning my order simply because I am looking for something more like a carry-on case than a backpack. I think if you are looking for a rolling backpack this would probably work fine.
3.0,"Ok for family pics, but my husband will never wear it again. Shirt was more squared and the neck line was weird. Length of the pants were long."
3.0,Didn't stretch much reason why pocket ripped
3.0,I didn’t like the way it looked on me
3.0,"wasn't happy with the entry point for the cards, on the back side.  Makes it difficult to insert and remove the cards.  Would be a better product if entry point was at the front, requiring less wear and tear on the plastic over time."
3.0,"Very soft, but don't know how it would have stood up to washing."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, and hopefully that should be obvious.  Don't expect stellar performance from a watch in this price range.  This watch does what it is supposed to--look like a particular luxury watch we all know and love.  It looks nice to those who may not be familiar with watches, but there are glaring differences.  Some of these differences are just fine considering the enormous price gap, but others leave me rather disappointed.  Let's just make a list:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks great from 2+ feet away.<br />-Keeps time just fine.<br />-Good, solid watchband.<br />-Casual or professional look<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the cyclops (Magnification window) is laughably atrocious, don't let the images fool you.  On the certain high cost watch this is modeled after, it is 2.5X magnification.  Here it has to be 1.5X magnification or less, if you could believe it.  I asked if there is customized options or a model with a confirmed higher magnification on both amazon, and their site, but received no response, so I ordered the watch as is.<br />-The &#34;gems&#34; just can't be diamonds.  I don't know why anyone would ever believe that claim in the first place is beyond me, but just to state the obvious.  It's either glass or artificial sapphire--don't go around bragging about the gems on it.<br />-The double clasp system on the watch band is unnecessarily difficult to operate one-handed .  I find myself pinching my skin as I try and get the damn thing to shut.  Bad design.  I think there is good reasoning why I haven't seen this design elsewhere.<br />-&#34;Imported&#34; also rather obvious, but I think we can safely assume it is made in China.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just be aware of it.<br />-The watch itself did not come with a nice bag or the small blue plastic bit to remove the links stated in the description and pictures.  What it did come with was a solid pin to take out the links.  You wouldn't think it, but getting those links out without a firm, steady surface took forever.  I'm talking a good 80 minutes start to finish.<br />-I'm not a huge fan of the exhibition back, but that's just my preference.<br />-The movement of the watch itself doesn't sweep as well as I'd like.  It looks like it ticks 4-6 times per second rather than the luxury standard of 8+.  This is probably just a limitation to keep the cost down.  Understandable.<br />-With the manufactures blatant dishonesty thus far, I am unfortunately a bit skeptical on whether or not it is truly sapphire crystal glass.  The sapphire glass itself isn't super expensive, so it is realistic for the price range, but I just don't know.  I could have it tested or try and scratch it, but I don't want to waste my time, nor the face of the watch.<br /><br />Now, it may seem I really dislike the watch,--I really don't.  I like it--and it serves the purpose it is meant to serve.  However, no other reviews really went into depth enough to really understand what you are purchasing, so I thought I would try.  You get what you pay for.  I wouldn't buy this for a gift for a family member or a significant other--that honestly seems really tacky.  This is a rather inexpensive watch with the look of a certain high end variety.  If that is what you are trying to accomplish, this is the watch for you.  If you are buying this for a quality time piece, or to show off to anyone who isn't strictly a novice or can recognize it is trying to mimic a luxury watch--well, I suppose you can make that judgement yourself."
3.0,Because the posts are on the head of the giraffe these earrings are a bit awkward to wear. They seem to big for the type of earring that they are.
3.0,"They are nice and stretchy however they are NOT cropped! They are all the way to the ankle or longer, I'll have to roll them up. I'm 5ft 7"""
3.0,Super cute. The straps are a little awkward. They sit too far to the sides.
3.0,My ankles are not large and these ankle bracelets are tight. Better as a large bracelet.
3.0,"I got these on sale, glad I didn’t pay full price. They fog up terribly even though they say anti-fog. The silver coating scratches VERY easily. They looked cool when new, and I love snap closure. That’s the only positives."
3.0,This is my dancers least favorite leo because of the synthetic feeling material. It reminds me of leotards in the 80's. She gets a rash if she wears it too long after dance.
3.0,"Cute, looked good through 2 washings and then it began to bag at the neckline a bit.  Overall a good buy but I shouldn’t have dried it in the dryer."
3.0,a little larger than I thought and the leather already has some scuff marks after only two weeks of wear.
3.0,"Sits crocked on the face.  I am disappointed, but it is to much of a hassle to send back.  I just keep them on my dresser."
3.0,I received these earrings two weeks before my event. They were the perfect color.  Unfortunately when I took them out of the package several of the stones had fallen off.
3.0,Beads diameter much smaller than expected. ..wish they were shown beside bracelet for comparison.
3.0,not very comfortable.......very tight on the toes
3.0,"My daughter really liked the look, but the shoes weren't as comfortable as my daughter would have liked."
3.0,"Color wasn’t as pink as I had hoped, but the hat fits great!"
3.0,"I was very excited about this shirt only to find out the bra insert runs small. It was so uncomfortable I couldn't even keep it on long enough for a picture. This top is not for well endowed ""implants"" women. Fits my teenager just fine."
3.0,The hook was nice easy to use but the stud was bigger than I was looking for.
3.0,It’s cheap not great quality  but you get what you pay for
3.0,It’s not made out of pima cotton at all. Just a regular cotton which is not as smooth as it should be. Over priced
3.0,This bracelet was very pretty and I liked it but unfortunately I had to send it back because it was too large and was only one size.
3.0,I bought these for my 10-months old son.  The socks are almost too small for him.  Not sure why the description says it's for 1-3 year olds. They slip off him very easily when he crawls.  I kept them because he needed non-slip socks asap but this is not a great product overall
3.0,The fit is great but it’s way more of a neon pink than light pink so it looks kind of tacky.
3.0,"Not fit well, uncomfy if you wear it"
3.0,Nice quality but runs small. Needs to stretch before wearing.  Should straps short.
3.0,It’s cute but it’s huge! My daughter isn’t going to fit this for at least a year. So order it small if you want it to fit now!
3.0,"I opened up my package today and found a group of socks that are not any kind of color that I would have ordered.  I thought maybe i didn't select the correct color, but when i went back to the product page i saw that the color is listed as a variety.  Probably in my case, i just got a variety of rather ugly sock.  I won't be returning them, but still, it would have been niced to know ahead of time that I ran the risk of getting ugly socks.<br /><br />They are very comfy and &#34;grippy&#34;.  I have previously owned many cable-knit slipper socks that I have purchased randomly throughout the years.  I always end up having issues with the seems...  some last longer than others but its always a recurring issue.  I don't believe that specific complaint is necessarily an issue with this particular product or just cable-knit socks in general.<br /><br />On the good side, they are super soft, very comfy and &#34;grippy&#34;. I would likely order this product again with the hopes of getting a better array of colors."
3.0,My 4 year old grandson likes wearing boots. We can not find any in the retail or box stores. The only problem with these boots is that they run small. My grandson wears a little boys size 11 we could not get them on they were way to small looked like they were a size 9.
3.0,Front latches were a problem to clip closed but ok otherwise
3.0,"I purchased a large which is true to size but it is not true to color, i ordered a blue, & i believe i got grey."
3.0,The chain snapped on the forat catch on something. I was able to fix it but shouldn't have had to. Other than that its a nice watch
3.0,"It is s beautiful necklace. Some of the links were broken/missing , and I had to put them back on the necklace. Otherwise, I love the necklace"
3.0,"I wear a US size 12, and the XL is too small."
3.0,"I like it but it really is not a wrap dress, it is more body hugging, good for layering under a blazer or cardi for office wear.  Mad I tried it on got deodorant marks all over it because its so tight.  Anyway just pay attention if you have deodorant on that leaves white marks.  Will revise this review when I actually wear the dress out."
3.0,"The stone on this is a nice size, however the carving is difficult to see"
3.0,The ring itself is beautiful but I ordered a size 11 and this is how far it goes on my finger.  I was told by the seller to use a tool to adjust it myself. Not a happy camper. Don't waste your time or money
3.0,"The shoes are adorable and well-made, but they run REALLY small. My toddler wears a size 3 currently and I ordered these shoes in a 4. I couldn't even get them on her feet. I'll either return or sell them"
3.0,Overall these are pretty good yoga pants for the price. They are a bit thinner than I expected but they are fully opaque and they fit very well.
3.0,Loved the print. Cute top. Thinner material. Great for summer or under a blazer. Boxy in shape does not define or showcase waist line.
3.0,It's okay... Material is not as thick as I imagined... see through. On hot days it could be worn by itself... length is short so problems to tuck in if you have a long torso. I barely get mines secured with a belt if I'm doing the tuck in but would come out time I raise my arm and I'm only 5' 5&#34;. Still a cute little addition for a casual wardrobe.
3.0,"This is such a flattering dress. I am 5'3, 220lb and usually wear a sz 16. I had to reinforce the buttons as 2 of them did pop off and I had to safety pin the top together a bit to control the girls, but it was an easy fix. Luckily we hadn't gotten too far from home and could turn around. Would have been very embarassing if it had happened at my hubby's highschool reunion. It looked adorable with or without a petticoat underneath. I live in a hot and humid area and the material perfectly thin enough that I wasn't sweating my butt off."
3.0,Nice color though and it stretches
3.0,Not really sure what I was expecting. Just didn’t look right.
3.0,It's nice. I got the army green. Color looks great on red heads! I'm 5'2 145 lbs. I got the small and it fits but the fabric is on the thinner side for my mom bod lol.does not flatter my tummy like other dresses on bought on here. The cut is a little low. I'm short as u can see and it falls just above my knee. Which is great for me! Not so sure if u are tall. I did a butt check too lol. I'll be returning it and sticking with my summer dresses by Fensace on Amazon:) I returned mine.
3.0,"Pants are comfy, but the brand sizing doesn't appear to be consistent. Ordered same size in capris and it fit ok though ultimately hit my legs at an unflattering point, but this is at least a size too big maybe more in the waist. Material is stretchy though but looks formal enough for the office!"
3.0,Wish there qas a little more support
3.0,"Cute dress but fit very tight in the chest. Also, it is very orange in places."
3.0,Giftm I didn't wear them
3.0,Beautiful but way to big and heavy
3.0,I loved my previous metal band with my old Apple Watch and wanted one for my new watch and ordered this due to Amazons choice. Definitely not what I expected. It will take two hands to adjust the band to fit how you want it. It was easier on my last band. First day with it so let’s hope it will get easier. So far though looks nice and sleek. Came in the package and was not secured so it fell right out once I opened the side. Would definitely expect the band to be secured inside could imagine it would be damaged due to being able to shift around.<br />Update: I had to return the band for some reason a few hours into wearing the band a red rash and bump started on my wrist so I removed my watch and left it off and my rash and bump did slowly go away. I was able to get a new band from a separate store and don’t seem to have the issue. So sadly this product didn’t work for me.
3.0,I only wore this peace once. Then it broke as I was wearing it for the second time.
3.0,I ordered the 2X size because that is the size used when in the hospital.  These socks are closer to the Large  that you would get there.
3.0,"Very nice bag, very spacious and lots of room to fit stuff. But unfortunately after a month the zipper broke."
3.0,"I like this the cheetah on it it is very cute but the jewelry turned my wrist green and I had to take it off, I did continue to wear the band and it was good"
3.0,I purchased the tank top style blue dress and received the 3 quarter sleeve dress with cutout's in the shoulder area.  I am not returning the item because my roommate says it looks cute on me.  I will second guess ordering through this company again however. Material is good quality and I am pretty excited about the pockets 😊
3.0,It's really small... I'm giving it to a child
3.0,"cute, inexpensive shoes in a useful shade of red, but too small, so I am returning them."
3.0,"It is not a tight dress. It is roomy around the waist also the fabric is a little stiff .  I was able to make the dress ""better"" by throwing it in the dryer for 20 minutes. I feel it made the dress smaller and little more tighter and soften up the fabric. which is what I wanted."
3.0,Slightly too big
3.0,Returned due to the proportions being off. Really tight around arms and chest but loose and long.  Sizing up would had been too big.  Good material tho just not for me
3.0,Bigger than I like.  I will pass it on to my teenage granddaughter.
3.0,"Low price, low quality. But it fit."
3.0,"ordered a XL where I usually fit a L.  I can wear a thin to medium sweater with this jacket but the body is pretty wide for tall women (I'm 5'7'') and not form fitting (not as flattering when there's a bunch of loose jacket), and the sleeves are just long enough to reach your wrists, so you can't use the thumb holes.  Nice jacket, not for tall people."
3.0,I bought this as a gift because I wanted it to be warm for cold weather. I like the shirt but it absolutely not a sweatshirt ad described. The description is completely deceptive. Just be warned ⚠️
3.0,"It's my fault that I didn't really take a better look at the shirt. It's got his stats on there, but his name isn't anywhere on the shirt. I think they should have had it on there."
3.0,"Very small fit, colors are not like the picture and the material is thin and cheap."
3.0,"More like a tunic or long shirt, which I can wear with jeans and boots or jeans and sandals. This may alos work as a beach cover-up. Besides being short, it fits well and is flattering on my curvy figure."
3.0,Headband was as pictured.  Nice piece of costume jewelry.  But it was a little tight.  Will have to stretch it out a bit so it doesn't hurt.
3.0,"I bought it for my 3 month old and its huge on her, wont fit for probably a couple more months."
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet, but run small. I ultimately had to return it because it was too tight on my wrist. Would definitely recommend for a beautiful accessory that you can dress up and dress down"
3.0,Way too small more for a 10 year old.
3.0,Nice sturdy bras BUT the padding inside is always moving and falling out
3.0,Very squeaky
3.0,Cute shirt but very sad that it runs small so had to return it.
3.0,It is a lot better than the Black and White one.  However it is not worth the money.  This one I will cut shorter and use as a Dog Collar...
3.0,"Bought these for my mom, they're very comfortable but they fit her a bit too big. And also they green part is camo print you cannot see on the picture. They shipped faster than expected."
3.0,"Overall, this product isn’t the style it appears to be in the pictures. I ordered my usual size medium which does fit but if you want the baggy look like the listing, order a size up. It also isn’t distressed as it appears in the listing either. It’s comfortable for sure but not at all as it appears in the listing."
3.0,It didn't reach over my waist as much as I would have liked
3.0,"Very this material, not very good for cold weather."
3.0,Like the mask in general but very large! Way too big for my face. It is definitely fir a large head! 😷
3.0,nice but looks cheaps and bends easily not worth the money
3.0,"I like this, my two complaints are obviously my hair gets caught in the trident. I wear a headset at work a lot, and the bar tends to hurt my ear."
3.0,It is exactly like the picture. But the arms are too small.
3.0,go up one size
3.0,I usually wear a Woman's medium.  I like a looser fit so I ordered XL.  They run small.  Much more fitted than I expected.  ;(
3.0,"I ordered 2 earnings. Both earrings came damaged. But hey, who I am I to complain, you get what you pay for right? I just wonder why I have to pay for shipping and handling when the item is not even handled. Smh."
3.0,Side are so tight that it gives me a headache
3.0,"Bought black and red; red is a nice shade but not as pinkish as picture.  Cheaply made, thin fabric.  No sewn-in tags telling maker or washing instructions.  Found washing instructions on loose tag but it was in symbols that I don't understand (will google).  With all that said, they will probably be OK for fall.  Not warm enough for winter."
3.0,They were cute but I kept hitting people by accident. They also came damaged.
3.0,"This was a cute necklace, not very good quality as it broke after 3 wearigs, also the colors were not natural looking."
3.0,"After ordering this product, I was very disappointed with the quality.  It is not a one size fits all.  The cap is small by design.  I will pass it on to someone."
3.0,I didnt dislike anything.  Everything was just perfect
3.0,Either my nephew opened it too quickly or it is cheaply made-the thing inside that holds the mask close broke upon dirt use
3.0,It is bigger than expected! The ring does not go in full circle.
3.0,Love these dresses. Just didn't like the pockets.
3.0,"It's cute, but be sure to order 3 sizes up or your rib cage will hate you."
3.0,"Most of the Stainless Steel rings on the market are highly polished, the description of this ring says ""Stainless Steel"" but nowhere is mentioned that is ""Chromed""<br />Chromed Stainless Steel ?? Why ??<br />The luster of highly polished Stainless Steel is beautiful.<br />Chrome is used to cover impurities and looks cheap"
3.0,Fit is very small other wise cute
3.0,"The large is more for a child's large, not an adult large."
3.0,"THe gloves were a costume prop, so they were fine"
3.0,For the price looks good and works good so far. Delivery was ok too.
3.0,"Very small, almost made for a child rather than an adult. I returned it."
3.0,"I read in comments before buying the white pair that these were not see through,but unfortunately they are.You can clearly see my tattoos on my thigh while standing, not just when material is stretched due to sitting etc. So also in the private areas as well,clearly see through. Other than that,they are comfortable and fit well."
3.0,These are amazing but they rip at the toe. They are small (8.5 shoe size).
3.0,"Sized up after reading reviews and the product still ran small.  Red was brighter than expected, although it seems to be made well.  Didnt get to wear it on the trip I planned and was bumbed."
3.0,Only thing I didn't like is it didn't have pockets other than that it was a good apron
3.0,"The colors are very dark.  This was the one stars and stripes band that looked modern in the picture, but when I got it, you can hardly see the red stars at all.  It has that same 'old' look as the other stars and stripes bands, most of which look nicer."
3.0,"The dress is absolutely gorgeous! I ordered a medium which is size 8-10 and I always wear an 8 and I could barely fit my 34B breast into the dress! I had to have 2 people zip me up and when it was finally zipped, my breast were smoothed the entire time (without a bra because there was no room for a bra). It's a beautiful dress but if you have breast even small ones like mine it'll be a tight squeeze. I kept the dress & would squeeze into it for another party!"
3.0,Everything I expected except I wish it was slightly smaller and would fit in a purse.
3.0,THIS IS A SILKY T-SHIRT TYPE MATERIAL NOT A SWEATSHIRT MATERIAL OTHER THAN THAT IT FITS WELL AND IS WELL MADE
3.0,"As  everyone is saying, this shirt runs super, super small.  I normally wear a small and even then, I have some room. I ordered a medium knowing that Chinese made stuff run small and it fits me like an extra small.  So you must order 2 sizes up.  The quality isn't that great either.  It's the thin, see through type material but not in a good way like the stuff that Splendid does.  It just seems cheap.  For the price, it's ok.  You can wear it for a summer and be done, but make sure to order 2 sizes up.<br /><br />I received a sample for review."
3.0,"Perfect fit! I ordered a Large and normally wear a large/size 12. I’m also on the fuller end of a size 12 (not quite a 14 tho) and wear a 38D. This fits the girls perfectly, wouldn’t be Timmy if you were bigger than a D cup and a size 12 in this large. Also, does seem thin in a comfortable way but I can almost see my bra if I wear a light colored undergarment. Length is perfect on my 5’ 8.5” frame. Definitely gave my wiggle room in that area. For the price, nice dress. You could prob size up if your a fuller size 12 or larger chested."
3.0,"They are very pretry, but I have wide feet and they were too small width wise"
3.0,"If your busty, probably going to be too small."
3.0,Bought this for myself and I normally wear a ladies large had to give it to my daughter who is 115 lbs and 5’7 ... fits her great
3.0,I wear women size eight shoes. These socks slid down the back of my heel just walking around my house. They do not fit like the picture. I'm disappointed.
3.0,The pattern and the design of the dress are good but the material is not great. It is not worth the price
3.0,"Nice blouse but they use different types of fabric. Doesn't give the same, strange combo"
3.0,The purse was a lot smaller than expected.
3.0,They are too small for my granddaughters ears. I will have to return them.
3.0,"I really love how comfortable this dress is and the pockets are awesome!! However, I only wore it once and it's already pilling on the front-- I haven't even washed it yet! :("
3.0,"optional strap should be in neutral color of beige, instead of bright silver"
3.0,"Not the best quality or the best fit, but it's ok."
3.0,the cat seems a little horrible
3.0,"This hand jewelry is very lovely , but the chain is very delicate, easily breaks and the snake is very small on a adult human hand, so don't be thinking the snake emblem is large. I will buy this again ."
3.0,"Not really sunglasses, which is what I thought they were.  Fit over glasses good!"
3.0,"They are pretty comfortable, however I wouldn’t use them for working out because it’s not make of the material for exercising. This are basically just plain leggings. They are very soft and super high waisted though."
3.0,"Update: I added 2 stars because of an exceptional customer service.<br />Even though the design of this brooch is nice, the quality is bad. I've got one in blue color and the tear stone is bigger than the metal slot for it, which looks super cheap. Initially I bought it as a gift, but now I am too embarrassed to give it to anyone."
3.0,These are fine but pricey so I would not buy again unless on sale.
3.0,"Not sure what I was expecting, but these are okay; just okay. Maybe give as a gift to young niece."
3.0,"Good price and looks nice, but the zipper came off the third time I tried to use it. Still functional without the zipper, but no longer viable for taking on the plane."
3.0,"The colors are vibrant, the pendant is the size of a quarter with a short chain and sturdy locking mechanism. Unfortunately on one of the earrings the back flap is loose which makes the locking mechanism not hold in place. This makes it impossible for me to wear the earrings. I do not know if it can be fixed. I love the pendant, it goes beautifully with almost any outfit and shows off my neck. I wish the earrings were better."
3.0,Nice top 👍🏼
3.0,"It's a cute dress, love the print. However, not a lot of shape to it. Kinda straight hanging...could have gone with a smaller size."
3.0,it fits the price
3.0,I would've loved the watch had it not been so small. As it's fit for a woman.  As you can see it has to be measured including the crown in order to come up with their measurement. Note to seller THE CROWN IS NEVER INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE WIDTH OF A WATCH! This is a women's watch.
3.0,Decent diabetic socks. I usually buy them at the local dollar store and these aren’t any better quality than those. Fabric is soft and loose around the shins like a good sock should be.
3.0,It rides up a little into my boob line but I can’t get any bigger it’s a weird fit that rides up. The medium impact is true though it does support even if it’s Ill fitting.
3.0,"The item appears larger on the display than in person. The display is a &#34;child size&#34; mannequin so I appears to be much larger than it really is. Also, to be nice they sent along &#34;matching&#34; earrings, that do not match the piece, or each other. One was gold tone and the other silver. When I brought this to their attention,  they said &#34;we just sent those for free&#34;, free or not, how about quality control. Will not buy from them again."
3.0,Color is not as pictured and the length is longer than shown. Has an odor hoping will come out when washed.
3.0,"They are cute BUT, I had to bend posts a little to straighten, and their more white then anything, not alot of color.. but I only paid 8 dollars"
3.0,"A bit short and snug around my top, but pretty."
3.0,"Good quality, fits large. If you are unsure of the,size you need pick the lesser size"
3.0,"Very solidly made thing. Spoil the whole picture absolutely thin arrows. They don't let you see the time, and require a few seconds to understand."
3.0,Decent quality plastic lenses but far less quality than the Ray-Ban glass lenses they replaced. Not a great value when they're only 20% less than the original glass lenses direct from Ray-Ban
3.0,The sleeves are a little shorter than shown. Not a bad fit if you go up one size.
3.0,It is a nice watch but the links are absolutely impossible to get out. I purchased this watch because they advertized that &#34;links are easy to remove&#34; and they are not. Considering sending the watch back to look somewhere else that has truthful descriptions.
3.0,Faids after one wash
3.0,Didn’t fit meet had to get a bigger size . Run extremely small
3.0,"Runs WAY small. I'm usually a pretty solid 2x and I couldn't even get this on my body. I even tried crossing the straps in the back rather than the front. Super cute suit, but I think I would need a 4x in it! Jeez."
3.0,Athletic wear that fits perfectly for working out.
3.0,Product is not the right fit for me. To snuggle in the waist for me will be returning.
3.0,"I ordered this in a medium, and although I am small chested, I found it to be extremely tight in the chest band. It will stretch slightly once you have it on, but I would recommend sizing up."
3.0,The color I ordered was not what arrived. I’m keeping it because I don’t hate the tones. The quality is good. I love the shape.
3.0,Only gave three stars.  Little disappointed.  Hoody is not detachable. Slight difference from picture.  There are no rows of skulls around neck area as hoody is attached.
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress in the photo, showing some fit and tailoring to it.<br />The listing says it fits ""as expected"" so being a bit top heavy (34D) I went with a M at first. I have the pink version of this dress in M, although there is a different name on the tag.<br />It arrived a few days ahead of schedule, but it was SO large and without shape - more like a moo moo column dress. There was no fit at all to it, it was so unflattering. I submitted for a return and ordered a S immediately, so I could have it quickly.<br />The S arrived today, and it is still so overly large and unflattering, I am incredibly bummed :( I could easily take 6"" out of the full back of the dress, and it still would be loose and unfitted. Such a shame, the length was great, quality looked better than the price reflected. The all-black top portion in S was tailored on me - the issue was from the ""belt"" and lower. The measurements are probably accurate in the listing, I was fooled by the photos.<br />I am 5'6"", 34D, and wear a size 6 US in EVERY brand, I am not too skinny!"
3.0,Like the dress but the criss cross tie was a little complicated. All the bridesmaids manage ok.
3.0,"I prefer this style strap on my Garmin as opposed to the athletic style straps. However, the buckle is just held on by a watch strap pin.  I have had the buckle just pop off the band twice."
3.0,"Owning several pairs of 5.11, I can say these are slightly better than the original. However, I probably won't go with these or 5.11 Taclite’s again. They trap too much heat, compared to my jeans."
3.0,"Very cute on, it was perfect for what I wanted but one wash and it got a hole in one of the seams.  😑  I don’t necessarily like having to stitch up a brand new sweater even though it’s an easy fix."
3.0,"Fits nicely, but there's no hood string and the hood is so large, it just falls down or it acts like blinders on the sides. Also there was a hole torn in one pocket already (cheap materials). But it looks nice and it's warm so far.<br />UPDATE: used for 6mos and the zipper now longer latches at the bottom :("
3.0,was shorter than I anticipated
3.0,The mask is very comfortable but they are not good if you wear glasses they fog up.
3.0,It ran small. It would be good for a smaller head.
3.0,"Glasses are ok, a little flimsy,  lenses are not as good as others"
3.0,The shoe was nice for the price. The biggest drawback was that the strap across the back was super short and it has to be buckled at the very last hole which makes it pop out and look funny.
3.0,Ordered a size up and still small!
3.0,"Very, very short in the front where the fabrics cross. Fabric also rolls up a lot"
3.0,"I have many dri wick shirts from various manufacturers, but this is nothing like the others.  It is slightly see through, scratchy, and doesn't feel pleasant against the skin.  It is smaller than expected, especially in the arms.  I returned it."
3.0,Belt was cut too short which was my mistake. The buckle though was very difficult to release the belt. For those reasons I have<br />Discarded the belt.
3.0,"This watch does work properly, but it does not look at nice at its picture.  My main disappointment is the color.  The images shows a very nice copper color.  Rose Gold is suppose to be a mixture of copper and gold, but this is more gold than copper.  It is also very light and cheap feeling, especially the band."
3.0,"Love this watch band. But I've bought a couple, and each one starts to ""fray"" at the edges after a couple weeks/months, and the links start to catch on stuff like clothing. Seal up the edges and it's a solid 10/10"
3.0,A little too big dial.... Rest quality is good
3.0,I like that it’s light weight with wide legs. Too small. Will return
3.0,Material thin and elastic may be binding if you have anything but normal or thin calves.
3.0,"It fits great until I washed them. I wore it the next day it arrived. Prefect fit, most importantly NONSLIP!<br />It was great for that day. It stays well.<br />Then I washed it - I think the silicone lost its &#34;stickiness&#34; after you washed it."
3.0,I sat the necklace down and my cat knocked it off an ottoman that was no higher than a foot off the ground and it broke my falling on carpet. If you want a fragile necklace this is a go to for you.
3.0,"The battery does not last that long, but at the price, my husband just tosses it and gets a new one."
3.0,Besides the shorts not fitting .. i actually really loved this purchase !
3.0,"I love VonZipper because I have a big dome. Their glasses always fit really well. These Skitch are updated, a little different shape than the original, but they still fit my face really well. I was very happy with these but after about 3 days a friend gave me a good hug and the lens popped out on my face. My original pair had this same problem.  I'll wear my VZ Stache for a while, they don't lose lenses."
3.0,This dress looks like I cut up a curtain and tried to make it myself. Not a seamstress but fits like the material- awful
3.0,I'm like a size 5/6 and I ordered a medium. Sizing wasnperfect but the picture makes it look like the tie sits further down the torso. Mine was right under my bust so it gave me maternity vibes and wasnt the look I was going for cuz honey I am not pregnant
3.0,"I ordered this item on two different sources on Amazon.  For the most part I am satisfied.  Two things that bothered me.  The grain of the wood on the fish varies.  Some are nicer than others.  Also some came with a prayer card, others did not.<br />If hand picking in a store, I am sure the better grain of wood would be purchased rather than the undesirable.  Also receiving a prayer card rather than no prayer card with key chain would be more desirable to  purchase. With ordering through Amazon, you don't get a choice."
3.0,Somewhat difficult to read.
3.0,Very beautiful but very small.  I am a normal sized adult and could not get it over my hand without a struggle.  So sorry to have to return it.
3.0,Looks like a bathrobe! But a NICE bathrobe!
3.0,"It doesn't have the encasement for the actual watch itself as it shows in the picture - JUST the band. And, it doesn't tell you that in the description. How do you buy the encasement?"
3.0,These were beautiful and as expected strong shoe but the colors scratched the first day and that was sad.
3.0,Works but almost too small.  Be aware and size up!
3.0,These are very small. Like child size. But we'll made
3.0,Cute items - my daughter was happy however one of them arrived broken :(
3.0,Posts split when placed over curved earring hook - despite reports to the contrary. They work very well for straight posts but only for the very slim/cheap ones. If like my daughter you have a sterling silver allergy - most quality earrings have a thicker gauge post - these will split if pushed onto them.
3.0,No leather. Feels cheap. The chemical smell was awful. I aired it out for weeks. I gave 3 stars because the 12 yr old birthday girl who I bought it for loved it
3.0,Have some problems with the suspender strap slipping over shoulders. Adjusting the straps caused a wedgie so we sewed the cross over in the back higher. Between it and adjusting the strap solved the problem.
3.0,The lenses fogged up right away when I tried it on. I ended up not wearing for Halloween.
3.0,"This is an attractive and interesting watch, but it's just too large for a woman.  I think it's considered ""unisex,"" but it only makes sense on a man's wrist."
3.0,"I was really excited when this came in the mail, because I had been wanting a watch with a magnetic band. However, the colors began chipping almost immediately, and the watch completely stopped working a month after I got it."
3.0,"Beautiful bright colors, but unfortunately I was disappointed in the lack of variety. (I was really hoping to get yellow) Out of the 12 I received, 4 were repeats of the same color. The snoods themselves are a cute vintage accessory, and they are well made. They stay pretty well in my hair with just the elastic, but I also added a few bobby pins in for security. They do have a &#34;factory&#34; smell as well, but personally that doesn't bother me too much."
3.0,It's good and kinda cute.
3.0,Had lots of fun
3.0,"A little to large for my facial features, but made well."
3.0,"Cute, but material is too thin... leaves gaps between the buttons where babies skin is exposed."
3.0,"Ring is beautiful, fits perfect. Disappointed, wore it 3 times then a stone fell out."
3.0,No dura mucho
3.0,"The shirt is thin so a bit see through. It also started getting bumps after just a few washes. The picture has not been affected by washing, just the material. My boy is happy with it, though."
3.0,"What is this, a chain for ants????"
3.0,Fits pretty good. A little small it counts but pretty good
3.0,Nice but won't stay up on my chicken legs
3.0,"I really liked the style of this green and blue argyle zip up sweater. It looks nice and form fitting in the listing pictures.<br />I ordered a large. I'm 5'6, athletic build.  The length of the sweater and sleeves are perfect.  It fits ok in the shoulders but it's very loose and baggy through torso and waist.  The arms even fit loose.  I'm guessing the medium would have been too short, especially the sleeves.<br />So, I like the style of the sweater, but will probably never wear it because of the sloppy fit."
3.0,"its ok , if u have a small wrist like mine i wouldnt buy it. iit falls off easily but very beautiful."
3.0,I got a 5xl and I'm scared to put it in the dryer (I'm a size 8/10 usually wear large shirts for loose fit) it's snug but it's definitely the right length  (extra long tank. Covers your bottom). But it is a very cute shirt- I'd say get at least 3 sizes larger than you'd think to.
3.0,The shorts are great- 100% cotton but the seams are sewn with thread that isn’t 100% cotton- I ended up wearing inside out-
3.0,"Can't say for sure, this was a gift for someone else."
3.0,My wife loves these briefs and I ordered her size 9. When they arrived the briefs supplied were size 12 and not size 9. It's a shame as this has happened twice. I hope this will be corrected as they are definitely worth buying.
3.0,longer than expected.  leather thin and cheap-feeling
3.0,"toe box is very small and I have narrow feet, the colour is great."
3.0,I like the style and long strap. However I don't know how to clean it.
3.0,It’s nice but way too large for me<br />I had to return
3.0,"I gave these to my wife. She was very disappointed because once she opened one, it wouldn’t close. My wife and I couldn’t even open the gold and rose gold…very dissatisfied."
3.0,Not that I disliked it but it was just a little large a size smaller wud be to tight.  If it wasn't for that I would've kept it. Seemed decent enough as a wedding guest. ☹️
3.0,"Love the fit!  And color , disappointed because they are not squat proof, they are see through! I’m disappointed because I bought another pair two weeks ago and is not see through not sure what happened this time! Material is a bit thinner than the other pair!!"
3.0,My baby hasn’t wore it yet but it does look as shown in the picture just keep in mind it doesn’t have buttons on the bottom so it will be hard to change the diaper
3.0,"Ordered to size (32 inch waist, got an XL) and it fit loose - didn't make me feel like I was being &#34;shaped&#34;."
3.0,The elastic bands used in the sleeves don't hold very well.
3.0,"I am a 14/16 and i hot the XXL and the bust is small but the waist fits. The button holes are WAY to small, will have to modify. the sleeves are so baggy and long i will have to take it to a tailor. Not sure what the material is but it is light weight. Glad i didnt spend too much given the alterations that will have to be made"
3.0,Could’ve lived without it. But adds extra layer and is like a security blanket.
3.0,Love these shoes. They are so cute but the bows keep coming undone and they are a little small. Should have gotten a size bigger than my regular size
3.0,wear 7.5 an ordered 8 they are to large for the way i like my shoes to fit. other than that comfortable
3.0,First  the Material is fine . However the Shorts are cut Small. To small for a true Size 32. I Personally will not be ordering from this Company.
3.0,The face came off within a week
3.0,I like the rings but I just wish they were a bit bigger.
3.0,"Real bulky, but pretty."
3.0,Backs do not stay on
3.0,I wear L. SO I BUY XL SO T-shirts are looser. This XL was very fitted. Snug. So size up 2 times. (Bra size matter!)
3.0,"I REALLY wanted to like this sweater. I puchased the orange color and it's that dark burnt orange that's perfect for fall. Loved, loved, loved the color. But that was about it. The shape of the sweater was unflattering. I understand its oversized, but it was just bulky in the shoulders and the the turtle neck part was pretty scratchy/itchy. I tried styling it with other things to make it work, but I just wasnt in love with it."
3.0,I’m 5’3 123 lbs and the small fits weird. Like the title says it’s not tight fitting the way it looks in the picture and also the armpit holes are too small so it seems like the type of shirt to make me sweat. Overall unimpressed with the fit but the material is soft and it seems like good quality
3.0,Really cute but I'd say it runs extremely small!
3.0,The material on this nightgown is very thin which I guess is good for summer but I do wonder how long it will last being so thin.
3.0,"Lovely bracelet, however, clasp broke after the 1st wearing...seems it was poorly made."
3.0,"I was happy to give these a go. Then the actual product had a sticker that said they were woman's glasses. Then i was shocked, horrified, and embarassed. I felt the scandal of wearing such awesome shades. Then I looked in the mirror and thought, I might look like a woman, but the system won't keep me down. The wooden parts are really impressive but the frames are dollar store quality. I don't regret it though, and still like to wear them. The roller coster ride of emotions was excellent."
3.0,they were broke..order a lot of these..first ime they looked like they try to fix them..oh well..printer wouldn't print so I could send them back then I found out have to pay for return..that ok not doing that..  grrr..
3.0,looks good just dont shower or where it around water color fades fast
3.0,"It's not quite as clingy as you'd expect something like this to be. It's made of a liner and outer fabric, so it's bulky and tends to move around. My daughter is about to turn 7, she's a bit skinny and this was wearable but still a little big on her."
3.0,Color was darker than expected. Also waist was uncomfortably tight.
3.0,"great look and the right cut for legs and butt  but a bit undersized.....very tight on the jewels,... needs a bit more pouch for comfort go up a size maybe.....depends on how blessed you may be."
3.0,Was an okay product. I was expecting it to be brighter but the numbers are very light colored. I returned it. Good concept though.
3.0,"This is beautiful to look at but unless you are shaped like a pencil, don't plan on wearing it in public.  Perhaps would be better suited for a bathing suit cover-up. There is no way you would wear a bra under it and if you have any chest at all, your going to see more then you want to.  The little mermaid had bigger sea shell covers on :-)"
3.0,It’s ok if I belt it. Not the cutest but comfy.
3.0,this dress is super cute it was just a bit small for me.  I am 5'5'' 135lbs and got a small.  I got a small because my small bust.  that area fit well but the sleeves and length were shorter than I expected.
3.0,"very nice looking and fit but very weak hinges. with the larger than usual ear stems, the hinges need to be more substantial."
3.0,Soft and nice but not quite as nice as it looks in pic. Also take over a month to get it. Not bad if you don’t mind the wait.
3.0,Would have loved these if didn’t arrive broken. Then I saw another pair I wanted to try and ordered those.  Maybe I’ll order again one day.
3.0,"This was a weird one for me.  I ordered this shirt in purple and boyyyy was it purple.  Think *beloved television dinosaur* purple.  It was short in the front, but also very loose and kind of hung off of my boobs in a weird way.  The sleeves are weird, the material is like a swimsuit.  Not a winner."
3.0,If you are heavy chested do not buy this
3.0,"Cheap material, might still keep it for the steal price!! Might be good for trips and vacation."
3.0,"The fourth strap closest to the toe was a little snug on my baby toe. I decided to keep them but had to make them more comfortable, so I cut off that strap. They work wonderfully now! Comfy and stylish. Just wish I hadn't have had to cut off the strap."
3.0,Great set of mask.
3.0,"Super cute and cozy! However, the neck thing on the sweater is not attached to the actual sweater, it’s a separate part; and the pants are more of a white color; and they run super small. I got an XL and I could barely put the pants on."
3.0,The fit was weird on me.<br />Everything for fine in body and arms but when I lefted my arms the band around my waist went up to my chest.<br /><br />Looked good in pictures but I just wasnt comfortable in it.
3.0,"Nice material, holds up to toenails better than my previous cotton ones. The elastic is a bit small for a 9.5 shoe size though. By the end of the day, the elastic is digging into my foot and hurts. Would still recommend as they are sturdy and good quality."
3.0,cheap made hat - cheaper nylon material with iron on logo patch - decent hat but not worth $ payed
3.0,It's great but I wish I had gotten the larger one. This one filled up way too quickly. I would definitely recommend it though because it keeps everything neat and easily accessible.
3.0,"They're cute but the edges of the ear pieces are extremely uncomfortable and sharp and stick out behind the ear, my hair gets caught in the metal pieces too easily."
3.0,Very tight around the shoulder and bust are.
3.0,Returnted
3.0,"This shirt was more like a 3-4XL and even though the print is nice and it does wash very well, the fabric is very cheap looking and paper thin.  It would be very cool to wear in summer if you don't mind lower quality fabric?"
3.0,"Very average @ best. They fit on my calf and thigh, but very large on my ankles and feet. I’ve had a lot of compression stockings during my lifetime, but none that ever fit like this."
3.0,Very nice but threads are already out
3.0,"Sonja B. is a brand I like as the few tops I have are better quality and more stylish than expected for such an affordable clothing line. This babydoll top looks 70’s retro cute to me and is nice and lightweight for summer. It’s made of 100% polyester, but mimics the look of cotton well without dealing with the wrinkles. I like the red color and pattern, the elastic bib design, ruffle trim at the armholes and lace trim around the bottom. This is machine washable, but needs to be line dried.<br /><br />I’m 5’11” so this may fit others differently, but this shirt is nowhere near as long on me as on the model, and I’d like the shirt to be a longer. It covers my mid section, but doesn’t come down to the the top of my thighs and doesn’t hang down in back enough to cover my butt or come close to tunic length (which would be really cute). The neckline comes up high on me and isn’t flattering. And this top runs really small in certain places for an XL. The arm holes are much too tight on me (odd as that’s not where I carry my extra weight) and the shoulders are too narrow.  I can cram into it, but the small arm holes would dig in and be uncomfortable to wear.<br /><br />When comparing it to conventional women’s sizing, this top fits more like a size M (about a size 8/10) in the armholes and shoulders and more like a size L (about a size 12) in the body. The sizing seems disproportionate even to itself, and the overall size just doesn’t fit like an XL (about a size 14/16).  In conventional sizing, I bounce between size L and XL, and XL is usually roomy on me. I’d rate this top 4 stars as I think it’s cute and reasonably well made so I like it. But I’m taking off a star because the sizing is too far off, especially in the armholes. 3 stars."
3.0,"My boyfriend and I loved it, but it is a little big on our wrist."
3.0,This is a really cute top. It looks well-made but it runs very small.
3.0,"Otherwise a really nice watch band, this particular band has a design flaw where, when you're wearing it and you bend your wrist toward yourself, it pinches the release buttons and the band clicks open.<br /><br />I wore it all day and it popped open multiple times.<br />A subsequent version of this particular band has a secondary catch to prevent this but I wouldn't advise buying this one without the backup catch, otherwise you'll spend time refastening the band.<br /><br />It's a nice, weighty, handsome watch band otherwise.<br />Wish this wasn't a problem because I like it."
3.0,You can only use it a couple times. The sticky comes off
3.0,"En el poco tiempo que lo llevo en 3 meses la camisa de cuero se a empezado a arruinar, en la parte de adentro la punta dura se siente que te apriete y te lastima los dedos de los pies, la suela está muy bien"
3.0,"Great shirt! Shrunk in the dryer though, and now it's too small. Would be 5 stars no question if I could still wear it!"
3.0,somewhat small.  very tight.  I have a very narrow foot and they were still tight.  Otherwise acceptable.
3.0,"The first shirt I got in this stile was the black and white printed one. It fit so great, was a long length and thicker material. Next I ordered the gray and it is noticeably shorter and thinner. I guess each color is different in sizing. I am very dissapointed."
3.0,"Very beautiful dress! Ordered a small and it was too tight in the bust (30DD, 125-130lbs). Had to return. Very pretty and nice fabric though."
3.0,"It was gift , could have been perfect, except for the lid joints are cheaply made"
3.0,This is cute but is definitely at least one to two sizes small.
3.0,Came on time. Material is thin and front label is too visible. Can see what you've been working on at gym. 6'1 191 got the medium sized.Can see some of my member
3.0,The buttons are cheap and kinda weird but the dress fits great. I am just replace buttons.
3.0,Great color and soft fabric.  Runs really small.  Thinking about returning.
3.0,"I am satisfied with the fit.  But, i wish i had looked a little longer for a better price or better quality for the money."
3.0,"03.21.21 review- sturdiness is right on the mark; durability and thickness are also very good; however, durability and thickness and sturdiness would go a long way if the design is done in a way that the cards are easy to pull out. I have to be very careful when pulling out a card because it will be easy for the sides to tear if I'm not careful.  If the design was made so that the upper part of cards has about 1/8th or 1/4th clearance for easy pull out, this product will sell much better."
3.0,It was too small. Maybe a medium would have been fine.
3.0,"It's an Ok corset... fits a little bit too large (tripes and shoulders) I got a Small (my size) but it seems to be made for someone taller than me (I'm 5.4). I'm going to have to DIY it because I don't  like how the stripes look on me, they dont adjust to my shoulder/chest area. I'll prpbably have to get rid of the buckles, and sew it all up together."
3.0,Socks fell apart  (literally unraveled ) after one use. But that's all you really need I suppose. Still would've liked to keep them.
3.0,"Product fits well around the waist where are the elasticity is. The arms and bust area run VERY petite in cut. There is absolutely no elasticity in the arms and bust area.  Overall style, material and concept of the product is nice."
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter, she really likes it, however the tag/tassle connected to the zipper broke within a week of purchase. She still uses it, it's just harder to unzip."
3.0,Had high hopes for this dress but def see through!
3.0,Somewhat small around back area
3.0,"Does not fit true to size will be returning it, the bra is actually a nice bra but the sizing is way off."
3.0,Material is too stiff. Not to my liking. Was expecting it to be softer.
3.0,The band was a different loop style than the one pictured. The spring style bar was broken on the one I received.
3.0,"When they stay on, they fit great. Definitely do not show past the edge of my flats. The first time I wore them, I could not get my left to stay on the heel securely throughout the day. The second day I wore another pair and could not get my right heel to stay on. Ended up taking them off both days. Since I bought a 3-pack, I'm sure that I will try one more time. If it happens again, all 3 pairs are going in the garbage!"
3.0,These are boys socks
3.0,Received and had to rip out messed up seam and re-sew it. Otherwise looks nice.
3.0,"The shoes were a gift for a 6 yr old boy and I ordered a size 3, hes in a 2 1/2 right now. They were extremely big on his feet, im going to say the size of a 4 or so. And very thin I felt for a boot. But ok otherwise, were just going to put them up till they fit."
3.0,I sent the bag back did not like it.I ordered  another handbag
3.0,Using them for my daughter's baptism party center pieces and party favors. They are smaller than expected but i will use them and make them work. Demensions are way off.
3.0,Top is cute but runs small.
3.0,"Generally Americans should order one size higher, to then have a snug ‘slim’ fit. Same as with any other European brands made for skinny men."
3.0,This romper was really cute but way to small!!
3.0,"They make a difference, but the fit is not as tight as I would've imagine."
3.0,"One of the earring fasteners on the back does not stay locked, and falls off."
3.0,"I have had problems with them staying closed, but for the price it is ok. I keep finding them in my bed. the color has yet to turn so I am happy."
3.0,"They are great, however run quite small. I am returning them and will order a larger size."
3.0,looks slightly different than whats shown the V neck is higher and seemed that the torso was a bit short.. or maybe i just needed a larger size. im a 6 but ordered this in (Medium size 8) and i should have gone larger
3.0,"I like this top and it looks good with jeans, but the top's pattern is different from the picture and that is disappointing."
3.0,Looks pretty.  Not sure if I like all the logos all over it. The fit was also a little longer than expected so I had to wash it. I am 5'8&#34; and 200 so I ordered an A2.  Top fits good but the hips are not very good.  The waste was good.  May take a while to break it in for myself.
3.0,"That hat seems well made and fits my son well. I'm not impressed with the way it was shipped. It was shipped in a plastic mailer, where the hat was crushed and the brim is bent. I'm trying to flatten the brim by weighing it down with books, so hopefully it will be okay. But would it have killed them to just put it in a box?"
3.0,Really dislike the fact that the handles come unscrewed often. I’m afraid I’m going to lose one of the pieces.
3.0,Love the shirt but veRy long
3.0,"I wanted these for summer yard work.  They're light and I like their length, but they're a little tight around my arms and it's uncomfortable.  Maybe my arms are just beefy though.  So ... if you have beefy arms, I'd try a different shirt."
3.0,Cute large for size
3.0,"It was a gift, but I hope to find a bigger one just like this one. About 3 times larger for all those cards you seem to accumulate."
3.0,cute though
3.0,Just a little bit for a 6 year old girl but good quality.
3.0,Just not what I hoped for. People noted the colors were dull. Agreed the blue and red were off shades. With a black backing fabric it will show if you try to scrunch.  Despite the nonslip back there’s not enough to cover the back of my head to prevent it from riding up.<br />Lastly the weird material on either end just doesn’t work with the fit.  It may work for someone with longer hair
3.0,It’s a beautiful little kimono style outer wrap but it’s way too large so I sent it back. I wish it would’ve fit as the material was nice & such a beautiful print!!
3.0,great at first then fell apart at the seems.
3.0,"it's pretty, but wasn't for me so I gave it away."
3.0,I ordered these as a gift for a coworker.  They were okay but not worth the price.  I realize they aren’t going to look exactly like the pictures because they are all different/unique.  But they look more beautiful in the photos on Amazon.  I’ve included a photo from Amazon and a photo of what I got.
3.0,"This was cute, but a little too long for me. The fabric really turned my off to the product. I expected seersucker, but the color was much brighter and the fabric was swimsuit-like."
3.0,"Used this for about six months, but taking it off and putting it back on stretched out the fabric and now it moves all over the place on my wrist. I had to buy a different brand to replace it."
3.0,Ok these are buttery soft no doubt about that but provide zero support whatsoever.  So if all you need is for your clothes to be soft these are the leggings for u.
3.0,"it's a beautiful ring but you get what you pay for and the plating is already coming off. However, it's a gorgeous opal or fake opal and my friend I got it for loves it."
3.0,"This ring is beautiful, but so flimsy and bendable that it hasn't lasted through three wears.  I'm so disappointed in this because I love the concept.  I'll be returning and spending a bit more on something that will last."
3.0,"GREAT FOR THE PRICE, BUT DID NOT FIT AS EXPECTED."
3.0,Too large for kids. Really only for adults
3.0,Pockets were sewn in backwards.
3.0,Came out looking great but literally took us two hours to install. You have to drill this into the wall piece by piece. And the instruction wasn’t clear so we made stupid mistakes while installing.
3.0,"I love the color and look of this dress--but I'm exchanging it for a size up. I'm a 32DD with a 27 inch waist, and the waist of this dress was the absolute perfect fit--but it was too tight in the bust. It zipped, but it looked...square. I'm going to go up to a medium and try it, but the size jump between the small and the medium (36 inches to nearly 39 in the bust, then 27 or whatnot up to almost 31) may end up making it too big. I suppose I'll have to see. My rating may change when I get the new one. If you're not larger-busted, I'm sure it would be fantastic!"
3.0,Large seam going down the middle of the back. Looks tacky.
3.0,"Cheaply made. Almost want to send them back, but i guess thats why the price is so cheap."
3.0,"It's cute, but the straps were too long and made the bust tie droopy. The waist fit well; however, I think it would be most flattering on an individual with a medium to long torso. Also, I was shipped the wrong color. I ordered cyan and the label confirmed as much but the dress was navy blue."
3.0,I purchased this because I needed a white top I got an 18 because one of the reviews stated it for as expected. But it was very small. It’s good quality though so I gave it to a relative.
3.0,"The fit was pretty good, it did not look bad but it was not a material I like and it was too see through for what I would be wearing it for."
3.0,"I was hoping it would be more cozy, but it was “nylons” and cool feeling. The colors are pretty though! It’s a gift for my grandson and if it’s comfortable,  we’ll keep it but can’t say until he tries it on."
3.0,One is a little small the other is a little large.  I will purchase a more well known name brand next time.
3.0,"It fit perfectly then ripped right away. Within 5 minutes, the fabric seem on the inner thigh ripped. I’m a small gal. It shouldn’t have ripped."
3.0,"I was disappointed that the claws were only only on one hand. I’m a lefty and would like a clawed left glove. It’s clear in the photo, but I had not noticed. Well made product, however."
3.0,It’s a nice product however it does partially cover up your tag.
3.0,too lazy to take a picture but it looks great but way too big it would be big for my dad too haha but i fixed with velcro and it kind of fits my head now so if ur thinking of purchasing just know it wont fit and u will have to do a diy to fix
3.0,"Material is soft and comfortable. After one wash there was a small hole in one arm and loose threads on the other. Do not buy black color unless you want every single particle of dust to show. Runs a bit large. I was a size large during pregnancy, bought a medium and was big on me."
3.0,Not bad for 3 necklaces. I wish the chains were in different lengths so I would have more versatility to stack them.  You do have options for length but all are the same so stacking them is a little hard but over all happy with the look and feel on them.
3.0,"I should start with mentioning that this is a very nicely made shirt, high quality workmanship. Details are great, buttons and stitches are high quality. Very nice indeed.<br /><br />The material is indicated as 100% cotton. That is why I bought it. The problem is, it wrinkles so badly. Just to see how it fits I put it on, I could see the wrinkles my every move left on the shirt, like walking on wet sand... I have iron free 100% cotton shirts that I had to wear for continuous two days, don't get one tenth of wrinkles that this shirt got in five minutes. Due to its nice slim-fit cut, it can be a nice shirt for going out partying or smth, but not for business.<br /><br />The cut is smaller than I expected although I chose the size after measuring myself and checked the chart in the listing. I recommend getting one size up..."
3.0,I ordered brown and it is orange! The length is awkward. Other than that it’s a cute dress. Material is good.
3.0,Watch is very large and the smaller gauges are hard to see.  The item did arrive ahead of schedule.  The item is also very different and a conversation piece.
3.0,These for small my son wears a size 10 I bought within his size for these slippers he also had issues with them falling off and the foam on the bottom moving to side. This caused foot to slide to the side. If your kiddo is 6 and under I wouldn't recommend they are cute but kinda a pain on little feet they just don't stay on. Everytime my kid bent down to play they would fall off. Over all they where cute made it on time and in good condition.
3.0,"3/5 would not buy again.<br /><br />Pro: I like the color & the feel of the material. The metal band is flexible & durable.<br /><br />Con: it's small, even for a small face, so it won't make a tight seal for a lot of people. Like a lot of masks with room for a filter, it works better in theory than in practice. It isn't much better when used as part of a double-mask system.<br /><br />For me, the worst part was the length of the straps: at max extension, they are just barely big enough for me, and I don't have a large face.<br /><br />This would be fine as a $2-3 mask, but it is sold for $8-10"
3.0,"I like this product. The material doesn't look cheap, it comes with socks. Overall it would be a great cosplay outfit. The problem is that it's too small. I usually can fit a medium (in US sizes). But it looks like this will have to be returned for an extra large."
3.0,"Its not worth spending$20 for watch. My money is just down in the drain. This product is not worth buying. The quality matches the price, Very cheap."
3.0,I love it. Very stylish and the quality is great.<br />*Update: Zipper broke within three months.
3.0,Love the material & color is just as pictured I absolutely loved it BUT unfortunately it is very short on the sides. And by short I mean the sides of the dress come up almost to the top of my hip showing my underwear. I was way to self conscious to leave the house in it so I’m just going to keep it for something to wear around the house or to bed.
3.0,"The quality of the leotard was nice, but it was too small."
3.0,"This review is of: Udalyn 4 Pendant Necklace Tassel Necklace Electroplating Platinum Clavicle Necklace Female Jewelry.<br /><br />Four necklaces arrived, all silver-so far, so good. Two of them are on silver cord, not chains. That's fine, I guess, but the cord looks cheap. The left-most necklace in my picture above,  has a tassel on the bottom made of several small chains. As soon as I put it on, a chain fell down my shirt. I wore it to work and when I got into my car later that day to go home, I found two more of the small chains on the floor of my car.<br /><br />I absolutely love the one that has a silver knot shape with the tassels hanging down. That one seems to have stayed intact, though I've worn it many times so far.<br /><br />The one with the three flat circles is just okay. It's nice to wear for day to day use, but it's not going to knock anyone's socks off.<br /><br />I love silver jewelry, but I don't like spending a lot of money all the time, so these do make for good day to day wear. Other than the one that seems to be losing chains by the second, the rest are of decent quality.<br /><br />Since I'm not sure what the pricing is on these right now, I cannot tell you if they're a good value or not. I can only share with you my experience, which I have done."
3.0,Came broken but they were too small for my liking anyway…needed a wow factor and this wasn’t it.<br />I was bummed because these would have been perfect!
3.0,I'm using this belt for IDPA. It definitely serves its purpose which is holding the gun and mag holsters but the way the belt fastens it confusing. You basically have to adjust the strap/webbing every time you put it on and the excess strap just hangs out. It does what it should but it's a lengthy process putting it on.
3.0,"Good material. After washing, socks shrink a bit and the more elastic parts of the sock are tight and cut off some circulation (for me at least)."
3.0,"Runs big, kinda cheap. But its cute for around the house."
3.0,So cute but not for anyone with size 7 and over
3.0,"The watch is OK, but the chain is terrible. We have not had the watch long enough to report anything else."
3.0,They were to short
3.0,Nice purse for a outing. Is small but that’s what I wanted. Closing the purse can be difficult bc it doesn’t snap quickly have to force it to snap.
3.0,"I thought these were full, but they're cropped. I was hoping to cover some rolls, but it only showed them lol. They also fit kinda small around the arm. I'm 130lbs and my arms are a little thick naturally so I gave it to my sister since her arms are smaller."
3.0,"Tighter than expected but with the right body, it is a nice dress."
3.0,I really like the color but they do tarnish/lose color after a while (about 6 months)
3.0,"The shirt was the great quality and color as pictured. I usually wear a large, but always wear XL for Woody's Retro shirts. This XL is snug and I need an XXL in this shirt. :("
3.0,"This sweater, as indicated in the product description, is not sized correctly and thus it should be ordered one size up. That's fine for women who normally wear size M or L, but for my wife who goes between XS and S, this one just didn't work out. It's too bad, because the quality of the sweater isn't bad. The fabric is pretty nice and it's a good level of warmth. It's just huge and poorly sized. We ended up giving this to a family member who normally wears size M and she said that it's a pretty good fit if even still a bit large. Also, for the price in the $30s, it's definitely not on the economy size, so it may be worth trying only if you love the size and you're pretty confident you can estimate the right size despite the poor sizing."
3.0,Cute top but a little small.
3.0,"Cute on your foot & well constructed, but not comfy for walking a lot. Not enough ""cush"". I always get compliments when I were them. I love the natural leather color. Very flattering on your foot."
3.0,"I don't love this thing. Maybe I just don't get it or understand it, but it's hard to use and to hold. I don't like it for me."
3.0,Not cute at all but good thick material may be good for the winter with skinny leans and a long sweater
3.0,Not bad but to tight I have an average head
3.0,Came on time and in good condition. The fit is as I expected. My only complaint is the fabric is somewhat thin.
3.0,"I didn't receive this cap that is in the picture,  I received a cap that looks like this, but it is not a U. S. ArmyLicense cap."
3.0,"Muy chiquito, muy apretado."
3.0,"These jeans are fun and comfortable, but buyer beware that they smell like petroleum, even after vinegar soaks and several washes.  I bought a 2nd pair, hoping they wouldn't have the smell...but, low and behold they do, and almost worst than the first.  On 7 washes now.  Good thing they don't shrink!"
3.0,Like the design.
3.0,"Arrived in decent time, the shirt fits well, but I ordered a size up just to be sure. The decal is iron on looking and was all stuck together and sticky when it arrived and if it gets put in the dryer. I just try to avoid putting it in the dryer. It peels back off itself without damage, just a cheaper quality decal."
3.0,"They were warm, but one of the buttons broke. Not great quality"
3.0,Not as purple as shown in the picture and the ball parts are not as big as you would think from the picture either. Ended up never wearing them because I don’t think they are pretty in person
3.0,It's so beautiful and I love it but the stones are falling out😭
3.0,"Well made, but they are slightly larger than normal wallet  picture holder and stick out a little bit. I would have returned them but was not worth the trip to the post office.<br />I am using an Alpine wallet, so they should have fit properly."
3.0,The wallet is ok quality but the zipper is hard to close at times. It's ok but I wouldn't buy it again.
3.0,"I was excited about getting the HomyWolf house shoes. The wood floors in my home are really cold in the winter. However, I was a little disappointed. The house shoes are slightly bigger than the size requested. The soles of the house shoes immediately started to wear off. I've worn them 3 times (for 6+ hours at a time) around my house and can clearly see worn down spots on the soles and can feel the thinning from the inside. Speaking of the inside, the house shoes are SUPER soft and once you get used to walking in house shoes a full size too big, they're very comfortable. Bonus: they're so cute and stylish, I could get away with wearing them in public!!"
3.0,I had purchased a smaller cross body purse and bought this to put in it. I haven't used it as it was just large enough that wouldn't fit in the purse.
3.0,"I'm not sure about the current style of dresses having this high waistline...so if you are apple shaped, it's not a good look."
3.0,It held up good for the price the charm just recently broke off after having it over a year.
3.0,I guess they some what work. But very hard to open and put on head. My son can not do it himself he needs help all the time. And he can still hear all the noises.
3.0,I am normally a medium but that was too small for me. Otherwise ok.
3.0,Super cute and lightweight for Houston’s weather. I gave it 3 starts because the material is a bit see through and after the first wash it started getting tiny tiny balls all over the dress.
3.0,Exactly what I expected. I use them to display pendants I design. The extender gives me increased versatility.  I have purchased these in the past and will no doubt so so in the future.
3.0,Neckline too tight.
3.0,This dress is nice it just didn't fit the event that I was going to
3.0,Product fits more like a 0-4months. Also had a loose strings above hood.
3.0,Color was wrong  material was stiff feeling.
3.0,It is what it says it is but I find it somewhat difficult to remove any given card from my wallet. On the plus side I accidentally ran it over with a 1 ton pickup and it suffered only minor damages
3.0,"Nicely made. Material felt great. However, it was dirty on the white puffs. I washed it and they came out, but still confused about what it was."
3.0,THEY WERE A LITTLE SMALL.  THEY WORK WELL FOR NOT SKID
3.0,I love the navy pair and they fit great. Tried on the grey pair and well... I couldn't even get them over my backside. I wish the sizing was more consistent.
3.0,same as the black one I got beautiful bracelet gorgeous looks good on me came apart they're easily just like the black one had to fix it too
3.0,I really thought this was black and red.  Turns out its brown.
3.0,Necklace got a bit rusty after continuous use
3.0,"I used this for my costumes. I would not wear everyday due to not knowing if they are going to hold together for that much use. I think they are cute and comfortable, they do not pull on the ear."
3.0,Purchased for my mom and it runs small.
3.0,"Love these, but the balls on the ring all fell off except for 3, after wearing it for the first time."
3.0,"I have thick curly hair, but it's pretty short. I didn't think I'd have any issues with this cap, as it said it was a one-size-fits-all situation. However, it's a little tight on my head so I can't imagine how anyone with longer hair would be able to utilize it unless their hair was up in a bun. The silky inside was nice and did the job of keeping my curls wrangled, but the cap wouldn't stay on my head. Every morning, I woke up with the dang thing on my pillow. Still, I noticed a difference in my curls, so I'm guessing it stayed on for most of the night, at least."
3.0,"Cute shirt but it doesn't hang casually as shown. It's a little stiff so it fits me more like a tank top, which if fine but not why I selected this shirt. The color is neutral which makes it easy to fit with lots of things. It's comfortable."
3.0,"The chapstick holders themselves are as expected. When I ordered them, I selected the quantity of 18. They arrived and I set the bundle aside. I just opened it to actually use them for goodie bags and there are only 15. I will be 3 short now as I have no time to reorder more."
3.0,Love the design of the tank! Material is soft. The tank top runs a little small. I bought a large but should have gotten maybe a 1X
3.0,"Very pretty, a light cotton a little see-through, but well laid out with the print nicely symmetrical.  However, the torso is too short and the waist rides up, not flattering, so I ended up cutting off the top and keeping it as a skirt. It's very pretty as a skirt."
3.0,This product does not last. The toe separates from the shoe.
3.0,I ordered a dark gray. This is taupe. More brown than anything.
3.0,"They shrunk quite a bit after the first one (air dry). I have to wear a belt to keep them up, and the legs are at my ankle bone now.<br />Just ok"
3.0,All the bracelets are ok but the black one has a frayed string that sticks out and looks crappy. All the other one are fine though...
3.0,"It's lighter than you would think, but a nice spring pullover.  Runs just a bit small."
3.0,I wear a small normally. Had to order large and even the large is too small.
3.0,This is a super cute top. However it is not supportive enough for me to feel comfortable and confident going out in. But I love the way it looks on my friends!
3.0,"Color was darker then image shown, darker blue to yellow.  Missing one of the plastic nose pieces, had to improvise so it wouldn’t put a divot in my nose!"
3.0,"The dress color, material and style were wonderful it looks more expensive than what it was. However 3 starts because the top of the dress comes down extremely low & will show everything. I usually like to wear low cut shirts, but this was too low and not flattering for larger bust women like myself. I had to use a pin for the event I was attending and it was still not enough to hold me in. I had to keep picking up the dress from the back to hold me in from showing my entire bra. I'm a 34D bust & 29inches in the waist so I ordered a size Medium, but If you are small on the top this is an amazing dress."
3.0,"Too small,had to give it away"
3.0,"This is cute, but a little short. I won't return it though. The material isn't too see through. I can get away wearing a beige or black bra. I'm 5'8, 140 and 36D. I ordered the medium."
3.0,Only had it for a week and it already has a tear in the inside of the bag. Nice design but the tear is a disappointment.
3.0,Inner and outer layer don’t have same stretch making for a weird fit
3.0,"This is really an adorable, well made bathing suit that my daughter absolutely adores.  The size chart was mostly spot on and the top fit my string bean of a daughter perfectly.  The bottoms fit great along the waistband but it seems they were made for a child with a fair amount of junk in the trunk lol.  There is a pretty significant gaping on in the outer thighs/butt area, no matter how high they were pulled up and I worried she may end up being exposed.  We went to a waterpark hotel and it was fine for dropping her towel on a chair and immediately getting into the water but I would be concerned about her walking around a beach or something similar in this bathing suit.<br /><br />It really is a nice suit but I honestly would look for something else unless your child has a rather large booty.  Unfortunately, we don’t always live in the nicest world and and have to worry about our children being exposed.  We will be buying her a different swimsuit for our next trip."
3.0,"At first I thought this bag was great. And it is in theory. It keeps my things organized so I can go to the gym before work and get ready at the gym. It also makes it easy when I go after work.<br /><br />There are a few things that really need to be improved. First of all, the cell phone pouch on the backpack straps does not fit an iPhone, which is a very popular phone, and it probably doesn't fit many of the other smart phones out there either. It'd also be nice if the larger of the outside pockets was in a location that is easier to get to when the bag is hanging in the locker.<br /><br />Now, here's the BIGGEST thing, and why I no longer used my very expensive gym bag. The shoe compartment needs to be more separated and more vented. At first I loved the bag, but then after using it for a little while, I noticed that my clothes didn't stay fresh like I had hoped they would with the separate compartments. Really, they were downright stinky from sitting in my hot car with my gym shoes while I was at work. All that separates your shoes from the rest of your stuff is a removable insert that doesn't even close off that compartment all the way. If they were to fix this, it would be much better.<br /><br />I ended up buying just a generic gym bag with a separate shoe compartment. Although it doesn't hang nicely in the locker like the GLO bag, at least it will keep my clothes from interacting with my shoes."
3.0,On the small side. I have an average size head
3.0,"The bracelet is cute, really it is and I love black butler, but the symbol piece is pointy around the edges and digs into my skin."
3.0,"These socks are very nice but run way to large, I ordered med but they fit more like X large."
3.0,"The chain broke right at the feather only the second time I put it on. I was able to repair it with a small pair of pliers, but note that the chain is short and delicate.  It's also not gold or silver, but more of a copper color.  I've added two inch extensions on either side of the necklace, but it's still barely long enough to fit me.  Just know that the chain is also very short.  The feather itself was bent up when it arrived, but not so badly I couldn't flatten it out in a book for a day and get it back to it's original shape."
3.0,It's cute but kinda cheaply made. It's not two sided. If it's hanging there is only one side that looks cute. I will not be using it as intended.
3.0,Runs small not very warm
3.0,They felt nice but were too small
3.0,"I purchased the XXL, knowing that it might rum a bit small. When it arrived, I was so sad to see but there was no way it would fit me. But my cousin who wears a M, was thrilled because it fit her perfectly. In fact she kept it on for the party and we'll super happy"
3.0,I bought 2 pairs of these shorts.  The Large is a wee bit small and the XL is a bit big. the fabric and construction of shorts is great!
3.0,One of the socks stitching was not well done. A portion of it is closer to mesh than the traditional socks you would expect. Other than that These would have been great socks.
3.0,"I get that these are $14 and that's already fairly cheap, but the feeling of these feels like $5. They haven't broken out my ears or changed colors or anything. The packaging they came in was nice. Just not worth the price tag for the quality is all."
3.0,"If you have a bigger chest definitely go up a size, maybe 2. Returned bc it would of been way too big for me to wear if I got the size I needed to fit the girls."
3.0,"These are beautiful earrings. Darth Vader is clearly visible (some of the other Vader earrings I bought were very hard to read, and no one could really tell what they were). The problem with these is that they are incredibly heavy! My ears get tired after an hour of wearing them, and they also give this stretched ear lobe look. If you are not used to heavy earrings, I don't recommend these. I am going to re-work them into a pendant since they are very nice."
3.0,It is a reasonable dress for that price but was boxier than I wanted. The colors are also very muted so overall it was a meh.
3.0,"The quality of the shirt is very good, but I followed their directions on measuring for fit and the sleeves came out about 4 inches too short."
3.0,"Don't wear it, it is bent strange so doesn't wear right. I tried to bend it to make it for correctly and straight but no success- it is soldered crooked."
3.0,Too small for adult head. Fits toddler well. Too big for infant. Not sure if real silk. Havent done the burn test
3.0,"Not the best. Does not look like the photos, fits nothing like I imagined and is very large."
3.0,The fit and fabric of this jumper were just a miss. It shows every little bump and issue. The fit was uncomfortable. It just didn’t work well at all.
3.0,Material was too sheer for me
3.0,My daughter is 5 and she is relatively short and shinny. 5T is small for her. I should order size 6. And for those who is considering size please order 1 or 2 size up( if your kids is taller or fatter)
3.0,Not small....same size as my original apple band ...
3.0,"I really like this top for the price range. The color is perfect, it is a pastel yellow. The only problem I see with it was when the front is tied, the shoulder area lifts up from my skin a little. Instead, I tied the strings in the back and used it as a jacket, and it was perfect. I paired it with a neon crop top underneath and loved it!"
3.0,Too soft. Had to return.
3.0,Should have been a little smaller
3.0,needs alteration. you must be at least 7 feet tall for this
3.0,"Thought the color was red n gray, but what arrived was pink n blue."
3.0,Kinda cheap looking in person I like other rings from them but not so much this one
3.0,"So pretty but much smaller than size indicates. Don't go by the sizing guide, it's at least two sizes smaller than what it says and there is no stretch at all. I was so disappointed because it really is pretty. The sellers responded quickly and gave me a refund but didn't have anything large enough to fit."
3.0,Receive
3.0,may need to get larger size
3.0,Great earrings but overpriced. Package is priced at 5.99.
3.0,Fits a bit smaller than u would think
3.0,"One sided print, needed print on both sides"
3.0,Nice what I expected.
3.0,The coverage of this bra is perfect; the fit across the back was very uncomfortable. Beautiful bra.
3.0,"It came about a day early, which was nice. But when I opened it, there was some blue plastic film stuck to the outter most layer of the clasp, The clasp cover if you will. Scraped it off and it was fine<br /> About a month later, a pin that hooks to one of the clasp sides broke. But I was able to finess another spring pin in and fix it to working order.<br />You pay for what you get, so far it's been working for me. Would buy again. Hate suffocating my wrists in silicon, and my wrists get wet too frequently to use leather. So a metal band like this is perfect for me."
3.0,"The gathering effect is average, comfortable to wear."
3.0,"These looked really awesome, but I couldn't get my foot in. If they'd had a side zip they probably would have been great.I had to send them back."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this. I love tipsy elves. Have several sweaters from them I am very happy with. Was a super cute idea but the material was not as expected. Black parts especially around the zipper looked worn and were white. Fabric felt cheap, like that puffy material you see used on many cheap Halloween costumes. I expected this from a $20 costume from Walmart. Not a $60 one. Sadly I will be returning."
3.0,Product fits fine. Quality is obviously not same as oakley. For everyday rough job it's good for the price.
3.0,Ordered large but more like an XL
3.0,"I was so excited to find Arale socks. These are cute, but the colors on two of the three pairs of socks were wrong. For example,  Arale should have purple hair not brown. The price is fair for what you get."
3.0,"It's a decent swim suit for the price. However, don't hesitate to go up a size. I'm a 36 C and a large was too small, unless you like a little side boob."
3.0,"Should tell more of size, did not fit as expected."
3.0,"I love the colors, but was not expecting a crop top. I knew it wasn’t going to be long based on the picture, but what arrived doesn’t even come close to covering."
3.0,the material was nice but I didn't like how small they actually were...
3.0,Just received these and they were exactly what I was looking for. I ordered a large (Typically wear size 10-12 and occasionally an 8 depending on make...and figured since these were elastic waist according to their sizing the size would be perfect to big as size is supposed to be 12-14). I would say that these are about an 8-10 for the large. They fit but they are snugger than expected. I think I would order an extra large (yikes) if I was to order again as I like to wear looser fitting shorts around the house. Always a gamble to shop online. Otherwise these were great.
3.0,"Very cute outfit, a little snug tho!"
3.0,"Nice fabric but both front and back swoops way to low for a little girl, she had to wear tanks underneath to cover chest"
3.0,Fits as expected and my son love's it.
3.0,This helmet looks nicely made but it does fit correctly. Most human heads are slightly oval but this helmet is made to fit a round head. Plus the sizing chart was not accurate (too large).
3.0,It's a bit thin to be honest
3.0,"Super small, I ordered a 6 with the measurements being perfect for me. 2 maybe even 3 sizes too small. I’m ordering a bigger size because they are really cute and great quality."
3.0,I thought the belly ring was very cute. It also came sooner than what I was told so that's always a good thing. But its very heavy and I can only wear it for a few hours at a time.
3.0,The straps are not easy clip which makes a bit inconvenient when trying to nurse they are hooked in and when you have a fussing baby its just really inconvenient. I do like the material it does run a bit smaller maybe one size smaller other than that you cant beat the price.
3.0,The shorts are great. The shirt ripped really easy.
3.0,"I'm writing this review having just ordered my 3'rd of these buckles. I've been using them to replace the flimsy plastic buckle that's characteristic of the LG Gizmo Gadget 2 smart watch for children. The rub for me is that the entire watch cost me $50 and thus far I've spent $25 on replacement buckles. Every time the buckle is fine, it's bombproof. It's the spring bar that $hits the bed. Yesterday my son came to me with his head hung low, watch in hand, buckle and pin in the other...the spring bar was still lodged in the strap with one half of the spring bar missing. It probably ends up taking some side load, bends and then comes flying out never to be seen again. In defense of Archer, the setup is not a *perfect* fit. The band itself is somewhat T shaped and the original buckle had for lack of a better term, moulded in washers which eliminated all side to side play. With this bar the 18mm fits with some wiggle, but alas I believe the 16mm is too small. A pair of small washers might help but those would be some truly teeny tiny washers. Still, this is cheaper than a new strap..."
3.0,"So I really dislike  giving  bad reviews  but in this instance I have to.<br />I ordered  these earrings they came on time and were beautiful. I was so excited I got ready  to put them on right away.  I put the first  one on, no problem when I went to put the other side in it had no ear post.<br />I was very  upset  but I know mistakes are made so what ever. I ordered  a second pair  in white  when they showed up to my surprise  the whole order is wrong. I ordered  the white and they sent another pink. I know have one broken pink earing and another pink that should be whiite."
3.0,Fabric a bit thin. I ordered a Medium and it goes past my knees.
3.0,"I love Patricia Nash designs and I was excited to get this wallet.  I have other wallets from her and they are awesome.  Unfortunately, I had to return this very cute one because it was defective  The coin pocket side of the wallet it looked like it was on crooked.  That's the first time I have run into that problem."
3.0,"Thin socks, not like lounge socks"
3.0,I was looking for a green hat and I got a grey one. I only kept it because it fits well.
3.0,Love this top my only complaint is that the sleeves are really tight.
3.0,A little on the hot side; band at top is a little tighter than preferred. Holds up well.
3.0,I feel more control in my thighs than my tummy but it did offer some nice control overall. I couldn't understand the straps.
3.0,I LOVE this watch but I was very frustrated when the clasping mechanism broke and wouldn't latch the very first day I was wearing it. I'll call Origional Grain soon to try and get it repaired/replaced but this is very annoying.
3.0,"too heavy, it itches to me very much"
3.0,"looked like a good watch, but it turned out to be too large as well as it did not work. the time would fall behind. may have been a problem w the original battery i'm assuming, so I had to return it."
3.0,Fits good and is very comfortable.  Have been look for a slip on that did not have a thick sole and european square toe.
3.0,"I have many 7 3/8” hats, all of which fit but this one. I’ll stick a bit of cloth behind the liner to make it work. Nice looking hat but one small flaw in top straw weave, disappointing but I need the hat for a function now."
3.0,"Too small in the thighs but fit every place else, but they are a size 4.  They don't look too tight but she fells they are too restrictive for<br />her liking.  Also they are a little darker than I had hoped from the picture on line.  I regifted them to a friend who is thinner than my daughter."
3.0,Husband said it wasn't very comfortable.
3.0,The problem is that when Ross was not made roughly and would not set while. The materials also a bit heavy and causes one to sweat a bit more than is comfortable. The elastic also creeps up from the bottom so that you have to keep we adjusting the item.
3.0,"These glasses good for gaming, but I can see my eyes! Sounds so weird, but it's true. Might return because it's kinda creepy!"
3.0,Returned mine because it was much bigger than expected but it did seem like quality material.
3.0,"Fit is a bit shorter than pictured (I'm 5'7"" and it hits just a few inches below my bum) and the sleeves are much tighter and do no stretch my full arm length.  Will need a couple of washings to soften it up."
3.0,I love this skirt but some of the studs did come off and it's a little short so I have to wear leggings with it but it's still pretty super cute!
3.0,The neckline was too low for my daughter to feel comfortable so had to return
3.0,"The jacket is too big so when I wear it, it makes me look huge. The shoulder pads should extend out more."
3.0,"Would recommend, not bad for the price"
3.0,"Quiero este vestido desde que lo vi, pero cuando lo compre guiándome por su guía de medidas, obtuve un vestido que solo cubría la mitad de mi. Fue una comple decepción. La tela no sede para nada pero sigue siendo hermoso si compras la talla correcta no dejaras de usarlo."
3.0,"Love the colors, I ordered a 2x, short's fit perfect but the top is a little tight, if you don't like your top tight order a 3x instead of 2x"
3.0,Kind of snug. My calf measures at about 17 in so these don’t seem to be made for thicker legs.
3.0,"I haven't had my bag long (purchased in mid November 2018, it's now mid December) and my bag has already started to fray."
3.0,I think this dress' pattern is very pretty and I enjoyed the pockets but the XL I purchased was too roomy in the bust and I typically do not have an issue with that. The waistline hits a little higher than it looks in the photo and wasn't my style. Seemed juvenile to me. Wore it once and will be donating it.
3.0,"The swimsuit top didn't really have any support for under the boob, so your boobs would just fall through if you moved your arms up or anything. The swimsuit is adorable though!"
3.0,The quality doesn’t look great.
3.0,"Con:<br />The photo for this item showed a brand name item (Sony). The item that came in the mail was from a manufacture I have never heard of.  Since China often shoots it's self in the foot so to speak as far as product quality goes, I chose this supplier because he/she was selling a product from a familiar manufacture I trusted.<br /><br />Paying for a brand name product but RECEIVING a generic, I felt duped and did not get what Amazon showed in this supplier's product description.............  Thus disappointed with both Amazon n and there partner in dishonesty.<br /><br />Pro:<br />a. The item arrived in the next day's mail in less than 24 hours from ordering and I believed I used the free shipping.<br />b. This button battery is powering my SegWay X2's wireless ""info key"", so far so good (about a month or so, but should last over a year, only time will tell on it's true longevity).......<br /><br />I probably would buy from this supplier again but with a tad bitO hesitation."
3.0,I just received this purse and I have to say that I am pleasantly pleased so far.  I like the feel of it and the adjustable strap.  Not to crazy about the hooks for the straps but as of right now. I'm happy with my purchase.
3.0,"I received this product very promptly, but when I opened the box, the terrible smell was overwhelming.  And the product had been jammed into a box that was too small, so the handles had bent.  I let the product sit for 2 days, in hopes that the smell would go away and the handles would regain their shape, but no.  I think the case itself is good, but I can't get past the smell and the weird, plastic handles."
3.0,"It  sometimes falls off to easily, but it does protect the iwatch, so not to upset."
3.0,The glasses are exactly what is pictured and pretty cool if that's the look you're going for. I bought them because the description stated that they were &#34;non glare&#34; lenses which was not the case. False advertising... if you're looking for glassses with an anti-reflective coating on the lenses don't buy these.
3.0,It's a rough fabric. Very stiff minus the mid section (which is obviously stretchy because of the elastic) I don't like this dress but I went to take it back to UPS and they stated the seller is asking for $120 to ship it back!!! INSANITY. No thanks. 👎
3.0,"Purchased off an influencer's ad with a deep discount in the red color. The color in person is much more of a rust, fall color than a deep red as pictured. It is comfortable and modest. I am usually a small in dresses and purchased in a small which fit well. The waist is tapered, but stretchy and the belt is a real tie belt which can be adjusted for comfort.<br />I will be returning because of the color, but would recommend this to someone looking for a family-friendly fall dress."
3.0,"These home slippers are cute and even cutter in person, but they are impossible to wear/fit them in my baby 's feet. I was very excited to get her a pair of cute slippers that will keep her warm in the cooler days and also protect her little toes from the daily incidents. I purchased a size up thinking she will have them for a good few months, but after struggling to get them in her feet (without a successful outcome), my daughter refused to try them again. They are way to narrow and small. The sole is so high in the inside part that it barely leaves any space. Too bad, they were very cute and would have been perfect for winter."
3.0,"If you have a long torso, size up! I ordered an XL, but received an L. Let me tell you, that I doubt the XL would have done much difference. The L ""fit"", and my butt cheeks were halfway out. It was more like a cheeky romper. Doubt that the XL would have covered my butt cheeks. Material was nice, I'd try again, but maybe I'd buy an XXL perhaps"
3.0,"5'3"" 105lbs and xs is loose only in groin area."
3.0,Tiny!!!!
3.0,Good for the price.  There were a few strings that needed to be restitched when package was opened.
3.0,"I got this in the mail today a couple things to note, first it's not as faded as it looks in the photo. Which depending on your preference might make or break it for you. I tend to like more faded looks so I was bummed about that but still not planning to return it. Second I'm 5'8"" and for me it was just slightly shorter than I am used to. Not to the waist short but I have several of this style of shirt and I would have loved one more inch. The material is soft and light so I am really liking that."
3.0,"these just didn't work for me, they didn't fit right anywhere, but i did find a different brand that were amazing for linen overalls, Dqbeng womens summer romper cotton linen short overalls, also if looking for denim overalls, Relipop Wom,ens Plain Jumpsuit denim overalls. i used both of these as bathing suit coverups on a cruise, they were amazing so cute.  i did order size up, usually a large., but ordered xl, due to i wanted them to look roomy. hope this helps someone"
3.0,"These are cute for costume. I only wore my necklace once, it was extremely adorable until my little face plate thing fell off. I had to take it off and i suppose ill have to glue it. I should expect for the price, but it was still upsetting."
3.0,Tough to get those wrinkles out of the bottom of the material is thick  on the bottom
3.0,Great piece of jewelry but not bright red like the picture shows. More like a burnt orange. Probably returning.
3.0,Green is very dark. Not as fitted as I would have liked. Shoulders were pretty wide. I'm 5' 7&#34; 135lb and I tried a medium.  Material was wrinkled but I didn't try steaming it.
3.0,"Comforable and cute, but cheap cheap cheap. The dress doesnt look exactly as shown. Ita much thinner fabric."
3.0,Wish it fit a little better.  Not quite as drapey as I'd hoped. A little snug through the midsection.
3.0,Came with a horrible smell. I had to wash it few times before use.
3.0,"It is good looking watch. Glad to have it. But few things:<br />1. Tungsten is 2 1/2 times heavier than iron, so this watch is quite heavy. Although it claims to be tungsten steel, it may have good percentage of tungsten.<br />2. I am not happy with watch mechanical part. It is no so properly fitted in case. Changing day, date or time shows that loose fitting. Also I felt a lot force needed when date and day change happens while setting time (+ve direction), it may drain battery every night while changing date and day. This might be reason for claims that it has Japanese powerful battery. Ordinary battery might have short life.<br />3. It does not have tool to adjust band. The band pins are very fine and so simple tool can't push pins."
3.0,"Nice bag, no complaints."
3.0,"I love the style, but need a DDD, and this only goes up to DD."
3.0,TOO LONG. I am six foot and it hits me at the navel...
3.0,It's really cute...but the material on the inside is really cheap. Not worth the price.
3.0,"Really like the detail on the chest/back. Fabric is a bit hard/rough. Size chart published by seller didn't work. Says Medium for Bust: 41 7 inch. My measure is Bust: 40in (which means according to them I should've ordered and S) and it was still too small all over. Wish I had ordered an L (my normal size).... other than that, honestly I really like the style."
3.0,"I like the idea of this shrug, but it is impossible to get it to lay nicely"
3.0,"good leather working gloves.  Won't keep your hands warm if the temp drops below 40 degrees.  I will buy another pair, good grip for axe or shovels."
3.0,"I thought that this hat was reversible, but it is NOT.  There is no writing on the navy side of the hat..."
3.0,The “assortment” of color was a disappointment.
3.0,Runs very small; nice design and lightweight
3.0,very comfortable  wish they had a full back. that would make them perfect.
3.0,The style is nice as well as the colors but from all the amazing compliments from other reviewers about the quality of the material I was let down to see it was just like any other costume cheap material with very delicate stitching that popped at the first try on. It will do for a Marie Antoinette look but I cant imagine it lasting more than one or two wears.
3.0,After 1 month they start coming apart at the top
3.0,"Comfortable shoes, but not any arch support as they advertised.  Not really any support."
3.0,I loved the fabric feel very soft and light to wear  but unfortunately at the first wash the white color was ruined because the black fabric fade into the white parts even though I add a catch color sheet on the laundry
3.0,Very sheer.  I am tall and they were still 2 inches too long.  I bought medium.
3.0,"I got it since it was cheap, it looked good, and I need a watch to wear at work that could get damaged. Had it for a week, got a couple compliments on it already. Tool to change the links almost broke, but lasted long enough to get the right size. Finish doesn't completely coat the links when you look close, but not bad from afar. Feels a bit chinsy, but everything works like it should. You get what you pay for."
3.0,They're relatively comfortable.  The black lenses are really dark when it's not completely sunny out.  Minimal fogging.  No complaints.
3.0,"Runs small or they got the size tag wrong, i dont know what happend...but it was very small, i have small and thin fingers... i order an 8 for my middle finger, an i did not fit....<br />It fits in my pinky<br />Is weird because i order an other desing for the same seller and was perfect! And i lovit.."
3.0,Love it! Fit perfectly but the eyes could have been placed better
