2.0,It's pretty and everything.. but it arrived with the flowers busted off from lack of packaging.
2.0,It’s such a beautiful clicker... except it won’t stay “clicked” it kept coming undone.. :(
2.0,Really the size of a Large that I picked does not fit.  It fit my granddaughter who is 14 - So picking a large is really a small<br />Very pretty but I didn't get to wear it.
2.0,"Super cute but waaaaaayyy too small, especially in the chest<br />Rated a 2 since it is very cute and stylish"
2.0,I ripped holes in upper portion in two socks while pulling them up. Otherwise OK.
2.0,These are not compression shirts.  They do ride up.  The only thing I can say is at lest they did not roll up.
2.0,"when I first wrote a review for this watch the month feature didn't work-I elected to disregard that small issue for a $10 watch-now the day and date features have skipped or more accurately they have failed to advance. I guess I got what I paid for. Why invest more time, no pun intended."
2.0,Very poor quality. The color tarnishes just after a couple of wears.
2.0,Does not hold up to washing
2.0,"I thought it was a long neckclaces but it's small. Also, I can not open the ""CLASP"" at all. Do I send it back or do I get another one for FREE?"
2.0,Sad that these were incredibly big and very loose.
2.0,Bought these because someone on Reddit mentioned that these are softer and bend well around smaller wrists but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. They also stick out on the hinges.
2.0,"Colors are waaaaaaaaay off from photos. These are light blue, olive green, and mustard gold. I bought them thinking they were light orange, charcoal gray, and light blue."
2.0,We did not care for the material and they fit weird.
2.0,"Upon opening the box I saw that the color of the boots were transferring the black boots color onto the off white box and the packing inside the box.  This tells me the shoe dye will rub off on stuff if they get wet so I'll have to be careful with them. The boots themselves are cute.  They don't go up to my knees though.  It's more mid calf.  This was something I was bummed about because I wanted a higher boot.  So just to clarify I am a leggy 5'7 so anyone my height or taller these boots will not reach your knees.  Shorter than me you will have more of a chance of these being up to your knees.  All in all these boys are okay for the price,  not impressed."
2.0,"Excellent undies. Great package pouch room, great colors, great price. Very comfy and soft. Best value in undies I've seen ever.......And I have to update this. I rated these as 5 stars initially. Unfortunately, I have to take away 3 and leave 2 stars because the waistband on these wore out completely somewhere between 3 and 5 months. They fall off. I sewed up one pair, and they are still not staying on, so sorry, these undies waistbands wear out making them useless except for rags."
2.0,Very short. You have to have something underneath like shorts or another skirt. Otherwise a fun skirt. Would definitely work better for a child.
2.0,"It did the job. I just needed it for my wedding night, that's all it would have lasted.  Like other reviews,  the beads were falling off even while it just sat for me to put things in.  I hadn't even carried it anywhere yet.  It's beautiful though.  So for the one night i needed it for it was perfect."
2.0,"I ordered this in 2 sizes for my wife. The dresses were 2 different fabrics.!? The smaller size was a great quality material, smooth and soft with a perfect amount of stretch but was a little to tight. No problem. The larger size should be just right. Nope! Less stretch, cheap screen printed pattern that showed the white base through the print as it stretched, rougher texture. Had to return both. If the larger size had been the better quality fabric, this would have looked spectacular on her. I'm sad."
2.0,I’ve managed to lose the back of one of m earrings. Can I buy one from you?
2.0,"This could be a great piece, but...<br /><br />With the straps so far to the sides, they don't actually stay up. I tried making them smaller and then they hurt AND fall off. LOL. The band is a bit small for a 36, but wearable. The cups are nice, and the low middle is great for a plunging neckline, but the bra is so uncomfortable overall that I won't get any wear out of it. I even tried crisscrossing the straps, which eliminates its use with backless dresses but does make it stay on. However, the straps aren't long enough to do that comfortably."
2.0,The size was to big
2.0,"I really like the inside of these slippers. I don't wear them all that often but the wear and tear on the top outside sweater like material was pretty quick and only after a few uses. The fabric is pulling up on the sides, separating from the bottom of the slipper, and the fabric is pilling and loops forms from pulled threads. By the time I should have done something about it, I was past the return window. I really want to like these slippers, the inside is really nice, but the quality overall wasn't worth it."
2.0,"Poor quality compared with other polo RL t-shirt, not as I expected, ,"
2.0,Purchased this tank top in a 2x and was very disappointed since that was the largest size offered.  Sizes run very small and I wish they would note that in the item discription.
2.0,This is smaller than I thought it would be based on the measurements proveded.
2.0,The waist is so snall.coated to the rest of the dress. It's not stretchy at all.
2.0,It looked nice but if you are top heavy it probably isn't going to workf for you.
2.0,"Loved the purse, strap broke. Looks like it was glued in."
2.0,"The earring is pretty but from the pictures it seems like u get multiple earrings. No way for u to tell which one you're getting from the pictures. Description says 1 pc, yes but no where indicates exactly which one you get."
2.0,these shorts fit a little large in the waist and very snug  in the thighs. I don't have particularly large thighs and never have this problem with shorts. I returned them. Cute pattern but a no go.
2.0,"It’s really cute and I love the flow my fabric; but it’s waaaay too large. I actually thought it was going to be tight on me because even though I’m 5’1, I still go back and forth between mediums and smalls with clothing. Because of it beginning really large on me, the portions are way off and and makes it unflattering. It would need a complete tailoring rather then just a simple adjustment of the hem which is what I’m used to. Trying to decide if it’s worth tailoring, exchanging or just return it."
2.0,"(if I touch the front of the glasses to push them up on my nose, they change colors)<br /><br />Cool idea! battery operated, 2 colors etc... but just not stable."
2.0,nice material and well constructed but very small
2.0,"The belt loop is too small. I can't thread the belt through it. Returning it for that reason.<br /><br />The loop is stapled together. It's not going to last. For $30, you'd think they could have riveted it."
2.0,"Not very happy with the quality of this. Not only was one of the snaps broken, which was not a major problem, but one of the straps came loose and had to be repaired. Unfortunately, with the broken snap along with the strap coming loose, I can't say for certain that I recommend this hat."
2.0,the materal
2.0,Logo is not distinguishable. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Only two colors were sent (so 6 of each). The picture is misleading, it looks like the 12 would be of different colors but that is not what was sent. The product description does not detail which color or number of a color will be sent nor do you get the option of choosing which color/s."
2.0,"The zipper broke on day two of using this bag , if you can see it’s an easy fix but just know you get what you pay for"
2.0,"I got around 3 weeks of usage off this belt. The buckle broke, but it is a cheap belt."
2.0,"These are beautiful pants. However; 1. they run small  2. the zipper was broken upon receipt  3. they're floods!<br />I contacted the company, and received a refund. I believe these pants were only designed for the slender woman.<br />I am 5'5, and 180 lbs. Be forewarned!"
2.0,I ordered a 36D and received a 32D will be returning
2.0,"I do not like lace, I tried it and easily returned"
2.0,"Didn't last very long at all, so sad because we love the watch"
2.0,"I usually wear a medium and sometimes small. I ordered a medium in this, and wow is it tight! It's skin tight actually, and pretty short. Also, the built-in bra is really pointless, as it does nothing to hide anything whatsoever. I normally submit photos of the things I review, but in this case, it would be really inappropriate."
2.0,I didn’t like the fit on me.
2.0,"I have purchased this top In the same size before. This time it is much smaller! I still wear the other top. Guess like everything else, we are getting less and less for our money!"
2.0,"The print is cute, but I purchased it thinking it was a raincoat it is more like a wind breaker."
2.0,"I got the one with the large red center and its pretty but flawed. It has bubbles in the center red stone.<br />If not for the flaws in manufacturing, I'd have given much higher rating for this item."
2.0,Grinch doesnt look much like the grinch
2.0,Not the material and fit as shown in the pic
2.0,definitely considered small- for A cup users
2.0,"Very thin metal, bands too easily every time the hair gets caught in it. Not comfortable to wear. I have to continuously fix it because earrings keep rolling."
2.0,Not pleased with the quality
2.0,I liked the pieces. Some of the clay was coming off of the lollipops. The other pieces were good.
2.0,"the quality is good, and the pictures look great online. In reality, they are not really for ""everyday"" wear. They are way too big and bulky to look flattering."
2.0,Looked pretty but the clasp didn’t work.
2.0,"way to small, seems like kids size almost?"
2.0,"Cute set and the mittens are true to size, but the hat is several sizes smaller than advertised. My grandson is small for his age, but the hat was way too tiny for him. For that reason, I would not recommend."
2.0,This ran very small and shrank up quickly as well. I was hoping it'd be a larger slouchy and relaxed fit but it's now unwearable. I'm so bummed.
2.0,"Too small, not a good place to put cash."
2.0,"It would have been nice if it had been less thick, it is too hot for what I bought it, I was expecting a plain shirt or sort of t-shirt"
2.0,"The fabric is a thin stretchy material; not thick looking like the photo. It's very long so I have to hem it, and the zipper constantly gets stuck making wearing it difficult. The style is cute but the material isn't. I want to return it."
2.0,The green amethyst was more clear in color than green. It was a little disappointing.
2.0,"VERY CUTE, DIFFERENT PRINT AND WAS REALLY HOPING TO LIKE THEM BUT THE FABRIC JUST SEEMED WAY TO THIN AND FLIMSY FOR MY LIKING."
2.0,Super cute but runs small. Will not hold up over time. Not the worst quality but not the greatest either. 2.5 stars
2.0,"Hat is made in China, the bill is short, it has no structure to make it stay firm. Not worth $25. Was disappointed."
2.0,"These are really good for sublimation. I liked how bright the ink shows up, the feel of the shirt is good. I ordered xl & they fit more like a large but they worked great for the shirts that I needed to make."
2.0,Was excited to receive a functional and good looking Timberland brand gloves. Received a cheap looking pair with threads hanging from incomplete stitching. It did operate my phone and Kindle but overall disappointed with a sub $5 looking pair that I bought for $8.
2.0,Not what I expected cheap looking
2.0,"Nice long camisoles, but very cheap material. One of the straps broke the first time I put it on and there are already loose strings on the fabric after just a few wears and washes. Also, the plastic piece to adjust the length of the straps is in the front of the camisole, which is very weird!"
2.0,"Another reviewer said that the inner shoe lining came out quickly, and I should have listened. They fit my daughter well, but the &#34;foam&#34; foot bed came out within a couple of weeks and fell apart. The shoes aren't much good without them. I usually like stride rite but I don't know if I should try this Made 2 Play version again."
2.0,Wore for 5 hours and it broke!
2.0,Stones too heavy pull threader out of ear
2.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this product due to the colors.  When I got the shirt, I was kind of blown away at the orange that was on the shirt.  I matched the orange that street workers wear for safety.  Mine was the navy, tan and orange.  I guess I will be safe when I walk down the street, because that is the only place I will ever wear it.  I am sorry, I am usually not negative, but this was a shocker for me.  Kinda false advertising to me."
2.0,my first pair of these prive riveaux sunglasses broke right in the middle. amazon replaced these without any problem. the second pair just broke in exactly the same place which is right in the middle. very disapponting. wanted to let prive riveaux know since i have 2 other sunglasses from them that i have had for couple years. i am hoping that i will be contacted for my input on these. thanks
2.0,But it will do
2.0,"This would've been an awesome hat for my inner witchy woman, and I was hoping to wear it everyday for warmth and style. Alas, it is small. My head is not large and I don't have big hair or anything, so unless this is for a pre-teen or child, I'd skip it. I'll be giving mine away to a witchy little niece who will wear it for warmth and style."
2.0,I returned this item weeks ago.  Just days after I received it.  I am not sure why you'll have not received it back.  The reason for my return is due to the quality of the fabric.  I started pilling.<br /><br />Please do not charge me as I returned the dress as promised.
2.0,These shirts are pretty tight on my newborn baby who only weighs about 7.5 lbs right now! Also the sleeves are very long and difficult to get on. The material is not stretchable as well.
2.0,- its bulky like any other denim jacket -Misleading - Loose at waist .
2.0,i have had to superglue them back together because there connection failed
2.0,"My daughter loves the looks, but on the first day of wearing, two of the pieces broke causing cut & bleeding.<br /><br />Cheap glass & not a safe product to use on body!!!"
2.0,It was too small and fit badly tried to stretch it a little afraid it might break and the sides were so sharp cut into my toe.<br />It came on time and they gave you a cute little bag for it.
2.0,This are quite see through and very light weight. Comfortable material but do not like parties to show through and they do with this short
2.0,Ripped after two uses.
2.0,Not crazy about the fabric for this kind of skirt. No movement.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:47efca3bb686ca51817e15694302b1f1]] Runs a little small(large) but if I size up to xlarge it would be too big. The sleeves are short (I’m only 5’2) and the print quality looks very cheap. I’ve had it on for about an hour the it’s fraying at the wrist.  Will see how it holds up after a wash. Not worth the price:
2.0,The cut/ fit of this shirt is completely askew. Seems are twisted and neckline is odd making shirt lie uncomfortably awkward. Guess it’ll work for pj’s- not worth returning.
2.0,Cute but has a hole in the side (in the seam).
2.0,"the jacket is a completely different colour from the pants, i'm so angry. this looking nothing like the picture"
2.0,Ordered 3 in different colors. The lace is itchy; ended up taking the padding out.
2.0,"Was looking forward to receiving this sweater, as I’d had my eye on it for a while. It took quite a while to arrive, 5 1/2 weeks to be exact. I wasn’t thrilled with the color, it’s not the most pleasant brown/tan.  And like other customers have reported, its poor quality. The inside button loop is near impossible to find, since its only 3 threads wound together I anticipate it won’t hold for long. For the money they are asking, it’s really not worth it.  But the photography advertising it gets an A+!"
2.0,Probably should have got 2x runs small.  Will see how they work when I workout
2.0,I have big gals but smaller band. The cups were not big enough to fit ddd cup and the band was too lose for size 32 band. Very awkward fit. May be better someone young with more perkier smaller gals.
2.0,"Too small, and too short. I am 5'3 and a size 8.  Disappointed with this one."
2.0,I ordered a 4xl for my boyfriend and it fits me better who wears a large. Not true to size far from it. I liked how fast it got here and good material but it sucked cause this was meant to be a birthday present for my boyfriend who absolutely loves dbz
2.0,It was bigger than expected. I suggest using a model for future bracelets.
2.0,"I really like the design of this wallet. It's slim, lightweight and attractive, but the reason I am giving it only two stars is because after a few days of using it with 4-5 cards (depending on the day) the band snapped of. I wasn't too concerned because it did come with a replacement band but, after a day of having the second band on there, it snapped as well. I have just been using rubber bands on it while I decide on what other card holder I should get. The rubber bands have been holding up fairly well compared to the band that this product included!"
2.0,"Fits tight, order at least a size up. The fabric is very thin, but the colors are amazing and very bright. its definitely what I would refer to as eye catching."
2.0,Almost can't see it's a heart shape.
2.0,"The audio they use for the button sounds awful, to me at least."
2.0,"With much disappointment I have to return this pair of shorts. It fits perfectly, looks nice, lightweight, and cool, but a key feature is defective in design. Zipper flap is front-facing instead of back-facing. When you're wearing the shorts, flap obstructs zipping in either direction, making it a struggle to open/close the zipper, and putting your hands in the pockets. So, within a few hours, the zipper malfunctioned because of the stress of opening it.<br /><br />Imagine, two hours into a run and you're fatigued, you need to easily reach for a power bar in your pocket. There was no need for a zipper flap in the first place - but then they fix it in the wrong direction."
2.0,Very small bar compared to the standard.
2.0,Had small hole which allowed water to come through lenses.  Had to rush around to find another pair somewhere.
2.0,"These are not as good as the last pair, they don't seem to be the same"
2.0,"I purchased this thinking I could wear it as a light jacket, but after receiving it, I realized it was more of a ""slim fit"" sweater. Knitting is loose and I had concerns around its life expectancy so I returned it."
2.0,"We use Fun and Function and I was hoping for an option that could arrive sooner, but this was not the same. It didn’t have the same stretch or material. I ended up waiting for my Fun and Function order anyway."
2.0,"The screw has come out twice. Yes, they include extra screws but the screws came out when I was away from the extra screws. Also, I was able to over look it once but not twice. I have a wedding I am going to and need to wear a white watch band, so I have put it away so that it hopefully will make it through the wedding. I have 2 other leather bands from another vender that I wore everyday and they did not break. It is unfortunate because it is a lovely watch band."
2.0,Time is always late every day for 10 mins
2.0,"Returned tops I had purchased 2.  I wear medium tops, these were way too small.  I was going to use them for tennis way too tight.  Now if you like clingy tight tops this will work for you but I like a lose fitting top. It looked well made. Fit does not look like picture."
2.0,doesn’t stay where it should be. Apparently it ended up hurting my feet
2.0,"Was looking for a basic black midi dress to layer with crop sweaters etc. The fabric of this dress reminds me of a thicker/stretchier version of the polyester used in halloween costumes (think witch/batwings etc), so unfortunately that is a big NO for me. The dress is not actually see-through at all if that's a concern, but it has a sheen that accentuated even ""no show"" panty-lines."
2.0,"This bag is extremely small. Pictures and price made it look bigger, sturdy and put multiply things inside. I wear a size 12 shoe and it took up have the bag. I was only able to put in a pair of workout shirt,  towel and socks."
2.0,One of the arms on the umbrella broke on the first day of use
2.0,Cheap readers. Lens scratch and hinges aren’t great.  Screws come loose.  Another bad product on Amazon.  Always a crap shoot!
2.0,Does run super small. This runs a a toddlers size. I returned mine.
2.0,This is not very comfortable on the face. The seams will irritate your face where it covers your nose.
2.0,WHEN SHOPPING FOR SHOES IF THEY ARE CHEAP YOU CAN BET THEY ARE CHEAPLY MADE I DON'T FIND THEM VERY COMFY & THEY LOOK CHEAP I ONLY WORE THEM ONCE & COULDN'T GO ALL DAY
2.0,"While the quality seemed fine, these are in in no way an XL. Maybe an XL for a child. I am a size 14 and wear an XL in all legging that I have ever purchased. These were definitely not an XL. I have returned them."
2.0,"Again very poor presentation impossible to see detail looks like yellow dots, short posts, probably intended for an infant."
2.0,It is much smaller than appears in picture.
2.0,"Wrong color? Check. Looks like cheap blanket? Check. Could use as rag? Check...<br /><br />I mean, it fits, but it is NOT what I ordered."
2.0,"This fit SO weirdly - like it was loose around my chest, but super tight at the stomach and hips area. And it really didn't feel that stretchy. It had a rougher texture. Returned it"
2.0,"Strange looking:<br />So this is a thin sheer camisole with no stretch.  It has this weird square of velvet in the middle front of the top.  Below it is sheer, above it is sheer.. and the back is sheer. It's kinda weird looking to be honest.<br /><br />But it fits ok, and I'm large busted.  The straps.. extended their longest are still a little shorter than I would prefer.<br /><br />It is a pretty color dark blue.  If I hide it under a front heavy cardigan, its wearable.  But it feels more like a polyester pajama top."
2.0,It’s look cute on but if you have big boobs this is NOT for you and if you stay in the water long the black fabric will stain your skin.
2.0,"Pockets are big and bulky inside, which makes the coat give an abnormal body shape. I gave it to my daughter, doesn’t look good on her either."
2.0,"I got these for free and thankful I did because they are so cheap and flimsy. They’re a hideous out of style design and I wouldn’t be able to wear them comfortably because of the nose pads, would get stuck in my hair when I pull them up on my head. I do it with all glasses so I try not to get ones with the nose pads and just the plastic. They’re very cheap and flimsy and will not last long. I’ll try to convince my husband to wear them while gaming but idk if he will lol"
2.0,The fit is awful.  It fits like it once had shoulder pads and the arms are too short.
2.0,Product came miss shaped
2.0,Unless I received the Wrong shipment my 8 yr old can’t wear these. They are definitely adult size. Now I’m Starting to look again for kids Cotton masks.
2.0,"Cute, but way too small, especially after washing them."
2.0,"A very beautiful wallet in terms of design and quality of material, especially how it  feels and touch. Size is very good but the main problem is its mechanical function that fails to justify it's purpose by pulling a card out of the wallet.<br /><br />It can easily fit up to 6 cards, 4 of them will be cascaded but the problem you cannot hold the card easily (With your thumb and index) to pull the card out especially  the first, second or third card. Most of the time  if you try to insert your index to pull a card it will push the cards accidentally  inside and you can't pull it again so you need to close and re-open Zenlet. You will struggle getting the card out while standing at the cashier....<br /><br />In one of the testing with 6 cards while trying to pull the third card, 1,2 3 card got pushed inside and one of the card fell on  the floor form the back side.<br /><br />Using only three cards would be better because you can easily remove a card but again same problem,  many time the first and second card were pushed inside when i tried to take one of them,which make it difficult to pull it back so I had  need to close and open Zenlet again.<br /><br />I wish it worked well because i liked the design a lot, unfortunately i had to drop on this one a get back to my Secrid wallet."
2.0,I liked it after taking it out the bag but once I washed I….. OMGiGi!  I pulled it out the washed and it shrinker horribly AND it had little hole in various places.  the smocked top is poorly crafted.  It is very thin and see thru.  The only use i will get out of this is lounging or maybe wearing on the beach.  A waste of money otherwise.
2.0,Item was poor quality and not sewn well. Stray thread on the garmet
2.0,Great shirt super soft! Sleeve holes are big. Size run big I would size down.
2.0,I got it about 3-4 weeks after I ordered it (which was not a problem I was not in a huge rush to wear it).  The problem was that when I got the package the headband broke! I was able to fix it (kind of) but I won't be wearing it as the elastic is too tight. I will be giving it to someone that it fits so they can at least wear it. Bummer!
2.0,"The shearling  seems very thick on the interior. The quality of the leather and the stitching is very disappointing. The second time I wore them, not doing anything strenuous, some of the stitching broke."
2.0,The watch looks nice but my husband had it on one day when it rained and water got inside the face of the watch. It is supposed to be water resistant so I wouldn’t expect rainfall to cause moisture under the glass. Disappointing…
2.0,So the product is made out of a styrofoam type material. When I got the box I thought they sent the wrong shoes since they’re literally that light. When I tried them on too the right shoe back pull tag wasn’t connected and looked ripped. For the price not worth it.
2.0,Not as thick as I thought
2.0,I liked it until the strap came apart the 4 th time I used it.
2.0,Hat quality was not great and the logo is a cheap applique.
2.0,Looks terrible. Not even a peplum!
2.0,I got this for my children before school started… But there was a typo on the message. It’s also hard for them to wear as it’s very delicate and gets tangled easily
2.0,Ordered navy yellow. Described and pictured with hood... No hood present. Ordered large. Fits like a women's medium. Keeping only because its too late to exchange in time for holiday. Very unhappy. Don't waste your money like I did. :(
2.0,"Very difficult to put in and close. Caused my ear to become infected despite being cleaned well, which is not a problem I've had before."
2.0,Being that it was soft it did not provide height to my head.  It made my head look flat
2.0,"These jeans fit very small and extra long. Sadly, I had to return them."
2.0,"I like the glasses, but they have a bad plastic smell that gives me a headache. I hope the smell will go away by airing them, otherwise I cannot use them."
2.0,"For the size we got, this ran huge, the bottoms may have been okay, but the Top was amazingly BIG. Had to send back."
2.0,"I bought the white dress and had to return it, material is see through. Dress feels heavy"
2.0,Must be China sizes. Did not fit as normal size. Disappointing
2.0,"Nothing wrong with the rings but these sizes are not the sizes I wanted for a septum.<br />If you have a itty bitty nose and like small septum rings, this would be for you."
2.0,This dress is very pretty but the fabric is so thin!  There are two layers to the dress and you can still see underwear through it.  The dress fits well but you have to have a full slip underneath to not feel exposed.  I live in an area with warm weather and having to have the third layer makes me uncomfortable and hot.
2.0,its cute but sheds on everything
2.0,"The sequins at the edges begin to fall off after 2 uses.  The shoes were bought for a wedding and Christmas.  If you are looking for a one time use, then go for it."
2.0,"I got XL because that’s my normal size in shorts. It was too tight around my thighs. I barely had any space. For preference, I weigh 245 and I’m 6-1, I workout 3-4 days a week (boxing & power lifting)."
2.0,They fit larger than expected. They DEF stick but they completely hung out of dress. If you buy these get a size smaller than you normally wear so they don't hang out and if your using them for a push up bra.
2.0,"It only wore once before we had to donate it. Shrunk after washing and was so wrinkled after washing that I couldn't get the wrinkles out with an iron. The material is a bit scratchy.<br /><br />Pros: the colors were stunning. The one time she wore it, it looked like we had spent a ton of money on a baby boutique item."
2.0,The seams of the wallet ripped very quickly.  Low quality
2.0,Too small and not what I expected
2.0,Returning! Too narrow to do the job.
2.0,"I ordered my usual size, 8, and I could barely get this on. This was a seemingly quality suit and the color was nice. Order 2 sizes up or don't bother."
2.0,Quite wide - they fall off if I put my head down!
2.0,Very bulky in the arms and tight around the waste. I look like a big balloon!
2.0,"I ordered this in the hopes that it would work under my wedding dress, since I have a low back cut and need something strapless. Usually I wear a D cup bra, however, the D cup in this is still very small. The adhesive works well, but if you are large chested, be careful.<br /><br />Edited to say that the company did reach out regarding my review, offering to refund my purchase if I were to leave a 4 or 5 star review."
2.0,Very short and does not stretch. Seam looks like giant diaper. Couldn't even fit it to my waist. Don't waste your time and money.
2.0,Shorter than picture.
2.0,"Followed washing/drying instructions to a &#34;T&#34;.  Item came out 30% smaller, drawn up, and completely unusable."
2.0,Consistently pops off my neck and I’m a skinny lady
2.0,Fabric was stiff not like a jersey feel or look. Size was too small. Need to size up at least one or two sizes to get a fit like the model.
2.0,"The sleeves are tight.  If you are very, very lean, this shirt will work well for you. If not, you should order 2 sizes larger than your normal. I ordered 1 size larger than my normal and it still was too small."
2.0,It fit really wierd
2.0,to big and definitely wouldn’t get it for the price
2.0,A poor attempt to imitation of the cabelas PFG shirts
2.0,The size it's like a 28-30
2.0,"There is an abrasive seam within the interior of the cylinder that will destroy the surface of a leather (or exotic) strap over time.  The strap scrapes against this sharp-edged seam every time you insert and remove the watch/pillow combo.  My strap was ruined in less than a month.<br /><br />Also, the otherwise silent winder tends to squeak from the cylinder's contact with the rollers.  The squeak is more than a nuisance - it's a problem (especially at night).<br /><br />By design, this winder is a lemon.  Cool gimmick, but poorly-designed and executed."
2.0,"These earrings came exactly as pictured, but much larger than anticipated.  These earrings are not fit to be given as a romantic gift.  I would recommend for use as costume jewelry or for younger wearers as they are clip-on.  Overall, they work well if you know what they should be used for."
2.0,It is a wire or something that is preventing this dress from being becoming. Corset top will not lay flat. Bottom hits as expected. The top is a total wardrobe malfunction.
2.0,"Too small.  Ordered using the measurements shown on the page, but it won't reach all the way round.  Otherwise it's beautiful."
2.0,Thick and long Manly pipe
2.0,I am 130lbs and 34dd. The triangles are too huge and there was a lot of gapping.
2.0,No pocket although it clearly shows one on the picture<br />Very light weight<br />Tts
2.0,They do not float when attached to anything... that was the main reason I bought this so it isn’t very useful to me. If you’re just looking for a lanyard there are way more comfortable options that also don’t float.
2.0,Not leather like my other Born shoes - stiff and uncomfortable. Sending back.
2.0,Dented the first time I used it. Very thin structure.<br />I m betting it won't last more then three trips
2.0,Okay but the design was not shiny as in pics.
2.0,doesn't clean well. would be used to run over silver prior to using.
2.0,Cute shoes but almost a size too big.  I normally wear a 6 in women's. I tried a 6 in kids but way too big.
2.0,"These were sized for a women’s 6-11 shoe size. I’m a size 7 and I have about 2” extra space in the toe. That said, they are very soft. Keeping them because the price want bad, the color is good for me and I’m hoping that if they shrink they will fit better."
2.0,The tail is the only part that is ever worth anything. the bikini it's self is garbage.
2.0,S925 Sterling Silver Dangle Earring Set - The quality is good and they are good looking earrings - except there is &#34;925&#34; etched toward the bottom on each earring and the set I got has two right side earrings - when I put them on the left side earring has the etched number showing. Not Satisfied.
2.0,"I don’t like that you have to wind it up, I thought it was solar, disappointed!"
2.0,Because the shapes are the same on the longer earrings one goes up the ear and the other goes down the ear.
2.0,"Perfect fit, but not what I expected. Material is VERY transparent- would need to have underwear to conceal. Will not recommend for professional occasions - unless properly attired underneath lol"
2.0,The dress was very revealing and didn't feel very modest.
2.0,"Pls be warned that if this dress does not fit, the seller will deny you the ability to return it and will suggest that you just give it to a friend. I ordered a medium and  am 5’4” and the dress length fell at an awkward length about 2 inches ABOVE my ankles. Not at all as pictured. Everything else fit perfectly and I loved the softness of the material and the sleeve length but since I’m stuck with it, I’ll need to invest in getting it hemmed to a shorter length to make it wearable and cute enough to wear with a bootie."
2.0,"The dress has an odd fit and the top part is very boxy and unflattering. Also, the sleeves are a bit tight, even though the lower part of the dress is pretty loose, and there isn't a lot of room for arm movement. When you raise your arms, the dress rises up a lot. I tried giving it away to several friends, but it fit the same way on everyone who tried it on."
2.0,"It was a pretty ring, but it didn't last more than a week :(<br />Both rings broke just because I wore them."
2.0,I was under the impression that i was to receive the pair (King & Queen) shirt when purchasing. When in fact i only received the Queen shirt. I am originally a size XL but i ordered a 3X to be safe. After receiving i tried the shirt on and it was too snug and too short for my liking. Definitely runs small.
2.0,Not as square as they looks in the picture.
2.0,The arms are pretty large on this sweater... Its not as cute in person and is legit t-shirt material- not anything thicker.
2.0,"The watch is okay, but, sorry, I'm unable to read the very tiny point instructions, and there were quite a lot of them.  I also didn't notice instructions for attaching the band, although  maybe I couldn't read them.  Nice, but for me, not worth the effort (besides, I'm 72; time is short!)"
2.0,The straps are so long that the tunic collar comes half way your bust.
2.0,1 out of 6  has a rough surface. It hadn't been polished. The other five ones are OK but the 3 unadjustable one are too small.
2.0,"Nice but not 925 sterling silver, even if it's just plated, have worn for only a week and my fingers already green."
2.0,Not as tight in crotch or legs as my other compression shorts
2.0,Love the color... I get complimented on the look. It easy to slip out n over my head and comfortable to wear around my neck for an extended time during Covid.  It’s also easy to slip up & down when running from store to car.  But the material is not very breathable at all.  That’s my one complaint.
2.0,Cute and cheap but broke after I wore it once.
2.0,this was NOT the shade of blue I bought
2.0,One item broke as soon as i put it on
2.0,Cute but very small. I’m usually a small but doesn’t cover chest very well. Lots of exposed side boob.
2.0,looks weird on
2.0,Had 4 holes in it when I opened it. Super bummed because it would be great if it wasn't for that.
2.0,Too big my daughter is 18 months
2.0,I so wanted to love these.  They’re super cute.  They didn’t last more than a few wears.  They need some reinforcement on the toe to be a little more substantial.  I ended up buying something else that has been much better.
2.0,I absolutely love the way it looks. Images are very accurate online. But I only used it on my key ring for a day or two and it chipped. It's not durable enough... unless of course you don't plan on using it.
2.0,"The material feels like a workout shirt, the size runs small but long as well. Kinda awkward looking if you don't tuck the shirt into you bottoms."
2.0,Seems like I used it only a couple of times and there was no more left in bottle. Worked OK but ran out too fast. Maybe it drys up?
2.0,"We purchased the rose quartz, Jade and amethyst bracelets.  When we receive the package as soon as we touched me rose quartz bracelet it came apart. I contacted the retailer and they very promptly sent a replacement set.  Sadly as soon as we touched the rose quartz bracelet it came apart again.  We will be returning the 1st set and we're going to try to restring  the 2nd bracelet ourselves."
2.0,"Pretty poor, if I had the chance I’d go with another one no mouth cut out and nose holes are bigger then the eyes."
2.0,Poorly colored and you can kind of smell the color. Not a good quality( look at the picture with stiches). Good for very cury bodies!
2.0,"These socks are really cute, but the quality seems a little cheap.  My 3 year old put on a new pair and within 20 minutes she had a hole at the toe."
2.0,"Cheaply made, I think I just threw it in the trash almost immediately."
2.0,Material isn’t good
2.0,I love these bags but when i opened them 4 of them had the hole ripped where the string gos to hold. I had to tape it to hold it.
2.0,cute shirt but ran waaaaay too small .  warn people about Chinese stuff
2.0,"The neck sags down low because of the poor quality. But it is cheap so you get what you pay for. It’s not a bad product, just the neck is so wide."
2.0,No good decorations
2.0,Too fit fine but the bottoms were so small I could have gone for a large in them and I ordered a small to begin with
2.0,"No matter what I adjust - neck, shoulders, arms, bodice, my boobs - the keyhole won't line up and goes back to looking like this. WHICH IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!  It's a shame because it fits nicely and is form-fitting without being too clingy but I won't be able to stand that mis-match."
2.0,The green color is just weird in person.
2.0,"I thought it would be small and cute, but it is big and clunky.  Would not buy again."
2.0,Cute but the opal colored ones are clearly different sizes. I ordered a set of 0g and one of the opal ones is 00g 😥 the slight color difference doesn't bother me too much but I do wish i could actually wear the one pair I bought this for!!!
2.0,"Despite what other reviewers said, these don't run ""true to size,"" these are very large.  I was hoping it'd shrink with washing, but it didn't and now is too big, and is now unreturnable.<br /><br />This XL fits like a XXL.  Even a size down would probably not fit right, considering how roomy it is everywhere."
2.0,The backs don't fit right. So you can lose them immediately or not wear it.
2.0,Cute design but poor quality. The material is not breathable at all and feels cheap.
2.0,I am disappointed that I am 5 ft and the shirt is too short... compared to the photo. I feel that I did not get what I wanted. which was a longer version.
2.0,"The construction of this shirt was not thought through. The way the bottom green was sewed on makes it flip out, giving a pregnant person way more volume than is necessary. The cut and lines at the waist are also strange."
2.0,2nd time buying this and the plastic breaks off within a week or 2. Cheaply made.
2.0,"if you want a good led mouse pad that will work for a while, dont buy this one. it stopped working in 7 days. very dissappointed"
2.0,"I sent this costume right back after trying it on my daughter, not only did she complain of how bad the arms iched her but right away there was already a hole in one of the seams! Very poorly made!"
2.0,"Disappointed, only lasted through ten wears."
2.0,"If you are a small size like a 2/4 I would not recommend this. It is very cute but the armpits fit wrong, so big. They taper out when they should probably go in. That being said maybe it is for more endowed women than my small size c figure. Like I said cute tho."
2.0,XL is more like a slim fit large. Very cheap construction.
2.0,"Really pay attention to the size chart, imported from China, sizes run super small."
2.0,"Chain are very short, no as it looks in the pic."
2.0,"The material was very wrinkly and just appeared much older and worn than it should have for a brand new product.  I returned this but I could see it fitting the needs for travel, just not for me."
2.0,You better have a child size head for this to fit.
2.0,TO SMALL FOR HEAD
2.0,"Recommend by Utube stylist blogger. Very cute. I liked style for casual to dressy. Description on Amazon page lacks direction to put on. . They’re only earrings, right, but I found these a little tricky to put on. Also the stem bent. I’ll be returning for refund."
2.0,Looks great poor function.  It looks wonderful and fits comfortably but NOT high support.  I bought this for my daughter for soccer and it's not a high impact sports bra.
2.0,Back was too short and it had a tight fit
2.0,The watch is very pretty but it stopped working the second time I wore it.
2.0,Too small this is like a kids size.
2.0,I used this for a trip to Mexico. It only lasted the 7 days I was there. The rope material came apart that was holding the rope handle. I loved the bag otherwise!
2.0,Does not look like real shoes. Looks like costume or pretend shoes. Very poor quality. The fit is fine. But these are not built to last.
2.0,Good material. But it rolls down had to constantly pull it up. Won't ever purchase again!
2.0,"The fabric was very stiff, lace looked extremely cheap with fraying and bad fringes. Ended up returning this item and got a refund."
2.0,"These glasses are bigger than depicted, and also somewhat flimsy. Good for a halloween costume though, if you are dressing up as a rapper/pop star I suppose."
2.0,"the waste size is fine, but there is no room what so ever in the crouch."
2.0,"I am very upset with this purchase. Boots were cute and as pictured, but not worth the price considering all the others listed at same pricing. After 3 wears the zipper busted right off one very disappointed."
2.0,"This dress did fit, but the elastic around waist was a bit tight. The material also wrinkled very easily after ironing. Overall the dress looks like the picture. But I am sending back because it wasn't what I was looking for. The material is also different on the dress tag than the description. It is more Rayon than Polyester.  Cute overall, just not for me."
2.0,Like everyone else reviewing the necklace came tangled but was not terribly difficult to untangle. What I have noticed is that the necklace tangles with wear as well.<br />The rose gold color is what I expected and looks very nice on the small pendant and the mother-of-pearl inlay on the larger pendant is also nice. It's also a great length.<br />Both chains are very delicate and cannot be separated.
2.0,I use these for nighttime walks. The clips broke on a couple of them. They were also difficult to turn on and off. I won't buy these again.
2.0,"I was really excited about receiving this dress, because it looks great in the picture, and being cotton, I thought it would be really comfortable to wear and easy to accessorize up or down depending on the occasion, Boy I was wrong! This dress is too short to be a dress and too small to fit loose as you see in the picture, I ordered a medium, and I usually wear x-small, but it is still to tight.<br />The cotton is very thin and poorly stitched.<br />I don't think I will wear at all. I checked on some reviews and it actually seems that is a hit or miss with this item, since some of them actually look like dresses and some of them just like a short tunic. I hope in anyway that you might find this review helpful and if you are still thinking about getting one I would recommend to go at least 2 sizes up.<br />I got this dress with a discount in exchange of my honest opinion."
2.0,It was much smaller than it seemed.
2.0,I ordered my size and it came in very tight and sleeves were long.  Our of proportion.
2.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry  but way to small
2.0,The inside is like a towel so not as warm as some swim coats.  It also has the very large logo on the front which is why we ended up returning the coat.
2.0,They waste battery very easily. I have to change them every two days after one use.
2.0,I disliked the buckle mechanism hard to open
2.0,"I loved this pajama set.  However, one week after wearing the pants ripped.  Not the seams the material itself.  Would loved to give it 5 stars but my butt is hanging out.  For the price, this should not have happened."
2.0,"Horrible quality and sizing. I wasn't expecting a unicorn given the price, but this was very poorly constructed with cheap materials, and overall it just looks terrible. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it.  The placement of the embroidery is weird and the included slip looks awkward underneath. Also,  it runs SMALL. I'm 5'2"" 130lbs,  36D, and bought a size large. I'm usually a M, but figured it was best to size up, and it was still SO snug around the chest (gave me a giant uncomfortable uni-boob). So if you want to feel like you're stuffed in a sausage casing, maybe this dress is for you, but if you have a larger chest, this probably isn't the best choice."
2.0,Not as big as I expected
2.0,"This bracelet was a good price, but just not what I expected."
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this coat, especially since the zipper had just broke on one I had that was similar.<br />I was disappointed upon opening the BIG box that contained a med sz. bag with this big coat shoved inside.<br />I immediately took it out & removed the fake fur collar.<br />Then, got my ironing board & iron & pressed all the hard pressed wrinkles in it!<br />The collar looks like someone had washed it & dryed it. It was lumpy & looked like a matted dog! Probably explains why the coat was so wrinkly as well.<br />The coat in itself is of good weight & warm.<br />I bought a large just so I could wear bulky sweaters underneath.<br />Disappointed in the condition I received it in tho."
2.0,"This dress is made of extremely cheap material, almost feels like made of material that is used in inner wear. A little too soft for a party dress. Did not like the cloth one bit. It would be a great summer outfit, but will given the fitting, I will surely have to wear some kind of a small jacket on the top defeating its purpose of the dress. The picture in this listing looks very different than the actual material. The color is fine. The style and the comfort is great, but not the quality. I would not recommend this dress."
2.0,The color of this dress is not like the picture. The dress is very long and the top doesn't lay flat at all. I have a large chest so it should be tight and form fitted on my breasts but it's not. It doesn't fit like the model in the pic at all.
2.0,The dress is very short so if you have a booty be prepared for your butt to hang out
2.0,Ordered a large but it felt like a tight medium
2.0,"This took forever to arrive, and when it finally got here today, the back of the shirt has a horizontal brown streak in it. I can't tell if it's a stain or if it's a fault in the fabric itself.<br /><br />Whatever it is, I can't wear it as it goes right across the back of the shirt in the white portion. It's a real shame because the shirt itself is cute and fits well."
2.0,"True to size, but the sewing is weird around the boob area. Should be down lower"
2.0,Did not fit around calf
2.0,It slips
2.0,Break super easily
2.0,So tight around arms. Does not look like material in picture. Dont buy
2.0,I only Give It 2 Stars because the LEDs are really bright the remote control doesn't work An Inconvenient hassle to take out battery pack and it tried to switch colors without controller is also a pain
2.0,"PRO:<br />* $15.95 discount price on Cyber Monday allows me to freely chop up and customize.<br />* Wrapping lens/frame shape happens to fit my face contour (personal).<br /><br />CON:<br />* Nose piece not adjustable/bendable; way too high/tall allowing ample air-flow gap between bottom of frame and cheeks (designed to be used only/mainly with miopia attachment?)<br />* Temples are straight and too long (hitting helmet-strap mechs); not adjustable/bendable; with sharp tips painfully scraping along your skull when putting them on.<br />* Was obviously someone's returned item: trashed box, missing a neck string (I don't need it anyway), a micro scratch line on outside near the nose (I can't see it when I wear them).<br /><br />Even the similarly-priced (MSRP) Rock Bro sunglasses are better made (unfortunately theirs didn't fit my face contour).<br /><br />What I did:<br />* Threw away nose piece, and cut off the nose piece mounts (dremel flat)<br />* Cut the temples short, and put on those rubber covers<br />* Painted black the blue logos on temples that look like toddler's cheap toy.<br /><br />After those mod's (only willing per the discount price), they finally seem to work ok for me now."
2.0,"This watch actually looks silver when viewed online, but when I received it I saw that it was in fact a transparent watch.  A clear band with silver flecks in it.  Just not my style.  Although it looked to be a pretty durable watch, I ended up returning it."
2.0,"These fall off my head in the middle of the night, and this one got a large rip in it after only approximately two weeks of use. The only good thing about these scarfs is that they are very large for people with a lot of hair."
2.0,Too big.  I ussually ware &#34;L&#34; but this &#34;L&#34; is a &#34;XL&#34;
2.0,adjusted length. lasted two days and fell a
2.0,Not what is expected!!! Cheap material
2.0,It’s literally yellow.
2.0,Disliked feel of material
2.0,At the waist it was too big where it bows out
2.0,I ordered an extra large and couldn’t easily fit into a medium. This dress was so big and long. Would definitely recommend sizing down a size or two.
2.0,I bought these slippers cause they were cute and were also sposed to be warm and they are warm what bothers me the most is i ordered the size  large and they fit pretty tight for my size 12 feet they feel more like a medium as compared to other shoes and slipers ive bought in the past  they were also tight going on as is any new item ya buy but they had to be stretched to fit which also was a drag to do. so buy a size larger then you want so you get the fit you need
2.0,"The rod for this earring was just to long for my cartilage piercings. Although cute, the swallow is rather large and looks funky if you have a small ear. Good quality, just not quite what I was hoping for"
2.0,Runs small and is pretty short.
2.0,"Very high waisted, not as expected."
2.0,Strap broke within a week after purchase.
2.0,The jacket feels soft & silky & pretty color but waist area too small & sleeves extremely long.
2.0,"It's beautiful, but it broke the first time I wore it!!!!!"
2.0,decoration is not secured very well so I had to sew them to ensure they would not be pulled off
2.0,"So I did get a mask plus 2 filters and the mask itself does feel fine enough. The custom printed image has also turned out rather nice, although I will admit; it was a small single color image. That being said, I consider this a form of false advertisement. As the type of mask the advertised is not the mask I received. I's not even the same shape. It's oval shaped and the combined with the material, this mask reminds me of a black mouse pad. It certainly does not look like the mock image that was shown to me , before I actually bought the thing. Its also a bit smaller then the picture advertised and the nose area isn't adjustable like the picture implies."
2.0,Well-made shoe and wished the fit was correct.  The size itself was up a half size and the heel was way too wide.
2.0,Definitely not worth the price. I paid roughly $10 for this and it isn't worth more than a dollar store bag. Very thin and flimsy. I wouldn't recommend paying more than $2 for this bag..
2.0,"The idea is neat and sturdy but, you have to pull out all your cards to find the one your looking for."
2.0,Love the artwork but some threads of the inside white liner is actual coming through the black outer layer. It almost looks like a white stain on the rear of the mask.<br />This happened literally after wearing only twice.<br />Would not purchase again. Disappointed because I looked for a Dream Theater mask for months and this was not worth what I paid
2.0,"The shipping package was not damaged and contained 7 items. The Snapsmile Insole box inside was open and torn, was probably previously returned. needed the front trimmed to fit in shoes and did not feel comfortable to me.  I also ordered a pair of the ""best seller"" insoles and they have a better feel, fit and comfort.  Update: I wound up using these in my slippers for a year until the edge of the plastic moulding cut through the foam padding and then cut through my thick skin, OUCH !"
2.0,Item was ok except it is LAVENDER it is not even close to being Grey.
2.0,"Wore this skirt once. It just looks too ridiculous because of the fabric and the poofy way that it flares out, much more than the photo shown. May work for a costume, but not much else."
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress. I love the shape and the drop hem. Unfortunately it is see-through. I ordered the white and blue print.  It's also longer than in the picture, but that was ok, I am 5'7"" tall.  The material is a little cheaper/lower quality than I thought it would be."
2.0,This mask is pretty small.  It didn't fit properly on my 16 year old son that wanted it for Halloween.  Unlike similar mask on Amazon this mask is missing a spot for your nose.  It also has a very strong and unpleasant smell.  Due to covid we were unable to return it but Amazon made sure to take care of the situation for us.  Great customer service from Amazon.  I don't recommend this mask.
2.0,"Nice material, but runs small. I ordered a large, which usualy is a little big but comfortable, this top is tight all the way around."
2.0,About one inch too short for two of my sunglasses.  Fits very snug while cramming the glasses together.  The bump inside makes it worse while giving you less room.
2.0,It was a good belt up until the buckle broke after a month of use. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Really like this, but the only thing we got was the necklace. It doesn't have the little thing to fill it like it shows. That was the whole reason we ordered this one. Very disappointed."
2.0,SIZE UP!
2.0,They run way to small . Wasn't worth the time to send it back
2.0,I believe this is made for a child's ear. I tried to put it on and it was not near the size I would need. So I then tried to put the post into my second piercing... still didn't fit. I love the look of it but it will not fit most adult ears.
2.0,"Unfortunately the dress was poorly made. The front was uneven, and the straps were different lengths."
2.0,"The look cool & glow in the dark really well. Two of them broke the first time I put them on, the top ball just broke into a bunch of pieces."
2.0,This came beautifully packaged and was very pretty out of the box.  But wearing it was a different story.  I've had several friends lean in for a better look.  After a week it lost its luster.  Several said it looks like aluminum foil stuck to my ear. I've had to keep it in for a while because I have nothing to replace it with yet. Its ugly and dull. But the plus side is that its comfortable.  No issues and its been in over 2 months. Staying put. Would not buy again.  Not pretty
2.0,"This bag is perfect in every way except one; if you wear it as a cross body the bag sticks way out on the side and looks very odd. The bottom of the bag has a very stiff piece of material in it and it's sewn in, otherwise I would have removed it.  I would buy this bag in every color if this weren't the case. Also, wish the straps were all black instead of brown on the black bag. Seller, please let me know if you have this bag becomes available without the stiff insert at the bottom of the bag."
2.0,material is cheap and the fit is weird
2.0,They were 2 sizes to small and I ordered the correct size
2.0,This charm looks nothing like the picture. It looks like a faded hunk of plastic.
2.0,"The appearance of these earrings looks good, but their very light weight and the rhinestones are only on the outer side of the earrings.  The inside of the hoops are cheap plastic.  Also, as soon as I put one of them on, it fell off because the wire that attaches to the front of the earring and goes through the earlobe had fallen off.  I put it back on and hopefully it will stay on."
2.0,"Socks are nice quality- but I wanted the colors pictures and was sent three pairs of grey. No blue, no white... disappointed about that."
2.0,"I got this for my MIL because she’s the best Gigi EVER-seriously, she really is amazing and I love her so much. She cried when she saw the shirt and the picture frame we got her lol<br />She loved them!!<br /><br />However, once she took it home and had a chance to wear it, she said the fabric is some kind of polyester material and it got so hot she had to take it off. I wish it had been cotton. She probably won’t wear it anymore because she gets hot flashes and polyester is awful for that.<br /><br />It’s disappointing because she loved the Purple mauve color (and it looks amazing with her coloring) and the Gigi print was perfect. If only it had been made of a good material it would’ve been PERFECT. As it is now, it’s terrible."
2.0,the verse is not written in a continuous flow .
2.0,"I usually wear the Mukluks brand, but these were a lot cheaper, so I tried one pack. I only wore one pair for a few minutes and had to take them off, because the no-slip rubber dots on the bottom are HUGE,  and it was horribly uncomfortable. It was like having a bunch of smooth pebbles stuck inside your shoe. The sock part was otherwise fine, as far as I could tell. They didn't seem different from the Mukluks ones except for the unnecessary, gigantic texture on the bottom. They could save materials by making the dots flat."
2.0,I like this dress a lot and have gotten many complaints.  I have worn it once and now have a hole in it. Going to see if I can repair.
2.0,Arm warmers are not long or flexable at all
2.0,"I really like them and I really wanted to be able to use them.  I like the lenses, the frame and ear plugs.  Unfortunately, parts of the connection between lenses that goes over the nose started scratching my nose.  No matter how I adjusted them, it would always end up digging into my nose and actually causing pain.  Too bad, because the rest of them are really nice and work great."
2.0,Dislike cause it didn’t fit my daughter head.
2.0,Not as desired
2.0,There is no ankle support. Not suitable for old bones.
2.0,its a cute little bracelet and it looks like real gold. The only thing is that it came with some damage to the links. It looks like it’s peeling. I don’t know if this will make it tarnish or peel sooner. Update: I ended up returning it. Wore it once and the clasp became quite loose. Very annoying.
2.0,Too small for my ear. Instead of the products title as &#34;small snake ear cuff wrap&#34; it should be &#34;Childs snake ear cuff wrap&#34;. Misleading.
2.0,Runs short. Lifts & shows belly when you raise you're arms.
2.0,I was extremely disappointed when I received the product. I just gave it away.
2.0,"Once again silver not holding up to their expectations. Dull,lack luster after a weeks wear. You get what you pay for"
2.0,"Collar was a bit too high and stiff. Maybe after a wash, the stiffness will fade. Looks more like a mens collar rather than a woman's."
2.0,"It did fit as expected. But this is the second time I ordered a Vest with this seller. And the vest broke while I was wearing it the same way both times. The &#34;steel&#34; boning snapped in half on my waist (my waist is much smaller already than my hips and chest) for a while assumed I was wearing it too long or maybe it was my body shape. After the second time in the same area (& thats with wearing layers under the vest and only wearing a few hours) I have to the conclusion that for this price, your gonna get the same quality. Cheap. Do not recommend. If you really want to waisttrain YOU NEEDTO INVEST IN A GOOD QUALITY VEST especially one that wont hurt you. You do not want to experience a metal stick poking you on the side for hours... its horrible."
2.0,The material itself is ok. Stitching is weak. Color is nice. Way too small and short. Does not fall where it appears to in the pictures. Disappointed to say the least.
2.0,These kind of suck to be honest. They don’t fit any glasses I own very well. I could see them being beneficial only if you were doing a walk through at a plant where side shields were required. I think I’ll keep wearing my good looking safety glasses that fit over my prescription glasses that do not make me look like a clown.
2.0,"I’m not usually one to have high standards, but for $50? It’s basically a dishrag. Not a flattering fit at all. The pants are too short and the cardigan is too long. Material is very thin so I’d imagine it is very easily snagged & creates holes. Returning it."
2.0,"You get what you pay for with these and these are cheap. Socks fit on the smaller side, no absorbency, and have loose/uncut threads around the seems. Might be OK if you are of shoe size smaller than 10 or so and want super thin socks."
2.0,"It doesn't fit. They are not loose, they are too small in the thigh. Right length, and correct waist, but the thigh is narrow. The thigh is for a tall and skinny person."
2.0,"the watch is good but, its NOT brown, its a strange shade of grey. So if you want a great grey watch this is the one"
2.0,Since the gown has some Spandex in it - it does not fall around yiour body - the fabric hugs your body.  So please make sure that you wear the perfect foundation for this dress. It will have not cover up but it will accentuate your figure - so I hope you a nice trim figure.
2.0,The glasses are huge.  I have a small face and they didn't look right.
2.0,I returned. Based on other reviews I ordered a size up and its way too big. I usually wear a small 4/6 ordered the Med 8/10
2.0,"The collar is very large (think 70's style large).  The buttons are also large so the whole top effect is clownlike.  The sleeves are very wide and roll up every time you move, which defeats the purpose if your like me and your arms get cold when you sleep.  I read all the reviews and I wonder if the style changed as really this just doesn't compare in style or quality to any of the flannel nightshirts that I have purchased from other companies.<br /> I will be tossing this into the donation bag since I already washed it."
2.0,"It was a simple sundress, but it looked really weird. The neckline was awkward. The dress itself just didn’t look good. I have a body type that most things look good, especially a basic sundress. There are just a lot of much better dresses on Amazon to buy than this one. Please shop around."
2.0,"Style is fine, but dress is made from a shiny, spandex-y kind of material. I assumed that it would be cotton. Not really what I was looking for."
2.0,"Since there is no size options, i assumed this was a one size fits most type of item, especially with the huge elastic waist.  WRONG.  Item received is tagged a medium.  A medium in what category I’m not sure.  Little kids, like 5T?  Bigger kids that would wear clothes by age, 7-9x?  Junior sizing of 3,5,7,etc?  No clue but by the itty bitty size of the skirt i’ll say it’s for little kids.  It’s really odd as i went back to relook at their sizing and they definitely show a size chart with several sizes numbered 160, 150, etc…. But nothing showing sizes of S, M, L.  And you still have no size option.  Weird.  Needless to say, my little kids are now all big kids so had no here to fit into bitty skirt. Too bad because the skirt is cute and material so comfy.  Like a favorite soft t-shirt.  Would have loved it if it was the right size.  Overall:  wait until this outfit gets their sizing information correct on their order page, then you can consider it."
2.0,Somehow both too small and large at the same time? Fabric had little give and was too tight around my rib cage and looked like a mumu everywhere else.  2 stars for the nice colors and that it was a button up dress at all
2.0,I'm sure they would have been beautiful. I had to return them due to package being smashed in mail.
2.0,"Way to small...5.8” 175, 38 DDD- ordered the largest size they offered xxl (says bust up to a 40) its like a kids shirt. Really pretty, not worth returning, took forever to get here"
2.0,The didn't last an hour before they got a hole in them! My daughter wore them to the pool for 1 hour and before we left she had a hole. No dragging her feet and she was in the water the whole time. Had planned to take to the ocean if the don't last in a swimming pool not sure how they are suppose to last at the ocean!!!
2.0,I have an average sized male hand and these were to small to fit.
2.0,"Every time I take off the watch, one of the sides detaches.  I put on a coat last weekend and a side detached.  Luckily the watch stayed inside the coat sleeve.  Cute, but not secure."
2.0,"They are huge ... probably wouldn't fit younger than a 1 year old well, And at that point they need real shoes. Adorable idea though!"
2.0,Cute but for sure for children’s heads
2.0,"While the suit was really really cute,the sleeves were 3/4 size, the hat was doll size, and the panties fit perfectly. I needed it for a pool party that week so I made do with it the best I could."
2.0,This dress is super super cute but it’s see through n most lights. If you stayed indoors it might not be. Too much to worry about for me to keep it but I really wanted too!!
2.0,"There are three attractive pairs of glasses in this box along with one cleaning cloth. The box says they are rated for UV400 but that is definitely not true. I also did not notice any anti-glare feature. These were a bit uncomfortable to wear because the right ear arm on each frame will not open all the way. I kept trying to open it but would hear some cracking. Other than this, they work as reading glasses. In my opinion,  the current price of $15.59 comes to $5.20 per pair which I feel is too expensive due to the marginal quality."
2.0,Medium fits like a small. I wear 6-8 and the elastic on medium was too tight for working out.
2.0,"Love the print/design of the bag, but it's too small to hold much tennis gear."
2.0,"They look good, but don't feel right, kind of slip off."
2.0,"Sorry, It was not what I was expecting - good thick material, just the shape was a bit off for this &#34;top heavy&#34; girl..."
2.0,Returning shirt because I do not care for the material.
2.0,The diamond ball doesnt screw completely on..the arrow one hurts if you sleep on the side of the piercing..the spiral one hurts to put in and when it's in it irritated my ear really bad.. the multi colored and the green colored one are good.. not totally satisfied with the purchase.
2.0,"I love the color and design of these packing cubes, but unfortunately two of the zipper pulls broke when I first unzipped them. I contacted the seller regarding the defective pulls and the customer service rep promptly responded with an option to refund the purchase or replace the items. I was relieved by this company's great customer service and ease of resolving the problem! The rep also said that she would forward my pictures of the zippers to their quality control, which will hopefully result in a better end product.<br /><br />I will update my review once I take these packing cubes on an international trip that is coming up in a couple of months. If they stand up to the beating of multiple flights, hotels, etc, I'll change the stars accordingly. As of now, the rating is a neutral three due to the initial breakage of the pulls offset by the positive experience with the company standing by their product. I received a discount in exchange for my honest review of this item, which I hope helps in your decision making process!<br /><br />Update 6.29.16: Unfortunately another zipper pull broke off during our trip, and on the first day out of the country! Plus I found a rip in the bottom seam of the largest packing cube towards day 10 of our trip. Thankfully the rip wasn't large enough for clothes to start falling out, but I'm not too pleased with the overall quality. I'm lowering my rating from three to two stars due to these additional defects, bearing in mind that customer service was great for my initial review."
2.0,I wear a size 12 and bought a xxl as some reviews suggested getting a size larger.  This shirt looks and feels like I'm a wearing a tent.  I'll be giving it away to a friend who's a size 16/18.  The material is ho hum and there's zero shape to the shirt.
2.0,Small and unflattering. Position of pockets did me no favors what so ever. I will probably never wear this.
2.0,It's really pretty but the quality of the band is terrible. I doubt it will last another month before the band starts peeling.
2.0,"I like the bracelet but the stretchy elastic material used began to fray after a week or two. The frayed ends stuck out between the beads and makes it look very low quality and cheap. There's no remedy for this, even trimming the frayed ends doesn't help. I'll save the beads and remake the bracelet with a better quality banding."
2.0,"This shirt is a casual shirt with a round neck collar.  The material is supposedly top quality.  I thought the top was going to be super cute.  It looks nice and comfortable.  It took a while to receive this product in the mail.  It did arrive earlier than expected though.  I opened it and rolled my eyes.  This is clearly not correct sizing.  I went through the sizing chart and everything.  I wanted to be 100% positive that it was going to fit me given that it details that the sizing is not US.  Well, the sizing is clearly super small.  This shirt would fit a tiny person or a child.  There is no way it would fit an average person.  I was super sad about it.  I really wanted to at least try this top on.  As it is I don't want to chance ripping it or stretching it out.  The material is nice and I like the design of it.  The cut out shoulder parts are nice.  I'm always worried when ordering clothes online that is why I made sure to check the sizing chart and such.  I guess this is just a fail.  Maybe I'll give it to someone who can fit into it.  Like a 10 year old...maybe.  Overall it's a cute shirt but the sizing is all wrong.  The material is rather thin and I don't think it would hold up to stretching so I don't think I'll be wearing this shirt.  Good to give to a child.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.  There is no reward for a positive review and no punishment for a negative review.  This was my honest opinion of the product.  I only accept a free or discounted product if I or my family will use the item and want the item.  I know that I rely on other reviews prior to purchasing an item and I hope that you found this review helpful."
2.0,Thought this looked cute online.  Ordered my normal size.  Liked the color but Fit was slightly snug but the fit of the top/shoulders did not look anything like the picture online.  Was not at all flattering on me…. So I returned.
2.0,"The chain broke within two days of receiving it in the mail. Otherwise, the pendant is cute."
2.0,I'm not sure what MAN they think these fit. I purchased a large and they barely fit my child. Definitely not men's pants. Very thin and not what I thought of when I read waterproof pants. I would not buy again.
2.0,Chocked necklace too small. Had to give it away
2.0,Shrunk a ton.  Too short now. I'm 5'8 it looks more for 5'5.
2.0,This came sewed backwards. It still fits fine but there's a seem in the front that should be on the back and the pockets are behind me. Kinda weird.. and just a bummer that quality inspections aren't done with this brand. And I'm too lazy to return cuz it's all black and people won't really notice. Also I'm 5'5 120lbs and don't have insanely long arms but the arms are short.
2.0,One of the lenses fell out within the first two days.
2.0,"Dress for nothing like the picture shown, very big and frumpy."
2.0,I liked the dress in the picture - the fabric is cute but it was on the small side.  The waist elastic was under my bustline so I looked really busty which wasn't a good look.  :)  Buy a size up
2.0,"They did not measure the length from the seam at the neck as usual, instead they included the 3” of the collar making the overall length 3” shorter then the chart. Too bad, it’s super cute"
2.0,These socks are nice but they shrunk after the first wash.
2.0,"It's a cute watch and the face is quite readable....HOWEVER....the &#34;handbraided&#34; band does not snap buckle, but has two long ends through a pulley sort of thing that fits around the wrist and has two long braided ends hanging down, getting into and dragging through whatever the hand is doing."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:155566341cb04f1f9a95f43917ca7194]] It's too small I done like because  I thought it big
2.0,Dsnt fit as expected
2.0,"They are not the best to go skiing, or probably doing anything physical for that matter because the moment you start sweating or your prespirating they fog up. There is nothing you can do about it. I bought them specifically for skiing and like I said, I ended up having to take them off because I could not see pass my nose."
2.0,"Enamel poorly painted on stones. The set was cheap, and you get what you pay for. Poor quality workmanship."
2.0,Not stretchy at all. Super stiff. Wore extra Spanx to not look awful
2.0,Very thin. Not good quality for price.
2.0,"I ordered beige. Its ivory.<br />2 of the 4 screws were missing.<br />It blew over minutes after setup, and it isn't a windy day. Took 3 of us to stabilize it with adding cynderblock and holding it up.<br />Hugely disappointed. I bought this one instead of the cheaper ones thinking it was the right thing. Oh well."
2.0,Bought them as night shirts the girls use them as t-shirts lol. I would buy two sizes above what you need
2.0,It's was much smaller than expected and the material is cheap. I would not spend the money on this product.
2.0,Colos we’re not vibrant enough. I thought it was too faded out looking. Shiny addition to fabric was not shiny enough to make up for lack of vibrant color.
2.0,Did not care for these earrings
2.0,Very Beautiful Ankle boot. They ran way too small. I needed to go 2 sizes up. I ordered a 10.
2.0,There was a tag but it’s been cut out. And where ever this dress came from it smells like ferrets lived there also.<br />The ruching of the dress is all the way down which feels…. Odd. It looks better in the picture.
2.0,"I was really hopeful because of the variety of color options they have, but they’re completely see through."
2.0,"Quality is poor, material is so thin that it is sheer, and the length isn't quite long enough to achieve any of the styles."
2.0,"The second I put the white ones on, a hole appeared in the butt area.  Not sure if came that way or came about as soon as I put them on.  Other than that they seemed to be made a bit thicker which I like.  Disappointed with the overall quality because of the hole."
2.0,"6 year old liked it.  really not such quality item, but I didn't expect much for the price."
2.0,I ordered black and beige. The black is okay but the beige is like a yellow. I was expecting a lighter color like in the picture and I think I got the wrong color.
2.0,"Love the skirt, it has great movement from the cut.  Okay fabric, fit as expected, but the zipper broke the first time it was zipped up.  It looks like it wasn't sewn in correctly."
2.0,I ordered a size large. They fit my waist but they're baggy in the thighs. Not sexy at all. I will be returning these for a size smaller
2.0,Wore it 3 days before it lost a pin and broke. My pants nearly fell down at work.
2.0,"These earrings are very cute. However, one of the posts broke off almost immediately when I was removing the backing to put them on. It was a bummer - I didn't even get to wear it. I tried re-situating the post but it's not sturdy. Luckily I have other earrings with different organs of the body, so I mix and match the 1 functional ""brain earring"" with other organs. It's a shame the quality wasn't so good because I'd love to wear both earrings."
2.0,Product not  the  same  as picture  i picked it  because of the picture showing beads completely  around  the necklace  but instead it  was  just a cord.
2.0,"This dress looks good for the picture only. I am M size but I wanted to fit me really tight so I got size S and still was big.  The fabric is very, very poor. Didn't make the second wash in the washer but hey, you get what you pay for ."
2.0,Hair supply store quality. Could have gotten these from the hair supply store for $1.
2.0,The clips are a cheaper product and priced accordingly. The problem I found was the clips are so tight that you risk damaging your tie putting it on.
2.0,"This barely even deserves two stars except for the quality of the pleather.  The garmet was unlined, so there wasn't any hideous polyester material  , as is so frequently the case. Given that it's most glaring flaw was its unusually boxy construction, followed by the utter lack of fastening snaps for the lapels, I would wager this was constructed by looking at a photo of a leather jacket, but I could be mistaken.  I returned this within a half hour of having received it, only taking that long because I had to catch my breath from laughing at my own gullibility for buying  an interviewed item in the first place."
2.0,"Still wondering if this is real leather. It small, almost can’t put a cell phone in and close it."
2.0,"I like the fabric but the skirt is too short. I am not a tall person, I am 5'4'' 127 lb. and ordered a medium. It is fine on the waist but it is way too short for my flamenco class. Was not what I excpected"
2.0,"Ordered this for a bachelorette, but it was too big. I order a small for my friend, but the thing fit me and I'm almost twice her size at 5'3&#34; and 160 lbs."
2.0,Very thin material. Sizing runs small
2.0,"Also, the zipper is silver so that looks terrible!! The zipper doesn't come together like it should."
2.0,This is NOT a plus size dress!
2.0,The band was too long and there were no instructions on how to shorten it so I had to cut it with a dremel cutting wheel and it didn't come out too good but I made it work next time I will check the length and order it shorter that's why I am giving it a 2 star rating but it looks good and it is very easy to use
2.0,Color was not what I expected and there was a very odd smell.
2.0,"I took the risk to purchase the off brand Garmin band. It turns out on one fit it fit perfectly however on the other side the holes were too big where the band came off with screws in place. I will try hot glue to make the holes smaller and maybe it can stay in place. In the future I will probably not order another band. In addition, the screws and screwdriver did not come with my order.<br /><br />Update:<br />My invention failed I will have to other another band.🙁"
2.0,I don’t like that it does not stretch at all and it’s not that comfortable from the arms
2.0,They looked and fit great but unfortunately the material was so thin and flimsy that they tore badly when caught on something small they first time they were worn..  13 year old son could not be more specific but I didn't imagine them lasting too long after repeated washings.
2.0,"The material is uncomfortable and the fit just seems off. The waist is supposed to be high waisted, however it is just uncomfortable."
2.0,"NOT THE SIZE AS ORDERED, CUT OF FABIC IS TOO SMALL"
2.0,The clip slides off the debit card. The Clíp & Pom Pom are cute but sadly it doesn’t work
2.0,Too much fringe.
2.0,It won't stay on if it would I would love it
2.0,"Massively large (see my pic). I ordered the L/4/5 for my 4 yr old. She is on the smallish size height wise, so i did expect it to be long, but this was a kiddie mu-mu. Big in the arms, poofy shoulders, torso etc. Fabric quality was ok, sort of a brushed cotton, very heavy almost flannel like fabric, and fully lined. If there is ever a kid reboot of Designing Women, this would be just the thing! Nice colors and pattern though."
2.0,Don’t stay on
2.0,"This bag has so many excellent features, but sadly it fell apart within the first weeks of use. The fabric connecting the black loop to the shoulder strap disintegrated to threads (as pictured) with a few weeks of use. If the manufacturer can improve the quality, this is a great design. Love that I can unzip the shoe compartment while bag is in the locker to swap my exercise shoes for water shoes mid workout. Love the compartment for my swimsuit."
2.0,"The quaility and the style of this dress is of good quality especially for the price, I am returning the dress due to the color received is not the color shown.  The color I received was more of a Pepto Bismol pink"
2.0,Fit much smaller than expected. I was a bit disappointed...
2.0,I bought this for an event. It fit nicely and was flattering but the zipper was broken after trying it on for about thirty seconds. The stitching was also very loose. I would recommend buying a dress in store as many of these types of dresses I've bought on Amazon have ended up being very cheap material and poorly constructed.
2.0,It’s cute but I received 2 gingerbread men instead of 1 gingerbread man and 1 gingerbread woman. So a little annoyed....because not enough time to return for an exchange.
2.0,"I really like the fabric design, but was disappointed that it was cut small at a size that is normally very loose on me.  Will not take a chance to order from this company again."
2.0,Please Amazon these sun glasses are not polarized. They are tinted but they are not polarized to check look at car windows in the sun you should see little swirls that are invisible to naked eyes. Also you can try to look at a computer screen and you should have a tough time seeing it with polarized lenses.
2.0,I personally did not like the way they felt nor fit. I personally did not like the way the material felt nor the way the waistband was created. They seem very sturdy and durable I just did not like the way they fit others may love them I am sure. They seem to be put together very well i.e. good stitching.
2.0,Did not care for this dress.  Fits funny and not a fan of the color. I returned with ease with no problems.
2.0,"The fit was okay but having all one design and light color washed me out. It might look okay on darker skin, I’m very white. My husband said it looked like a nightgown. Unfortunately I missed the deadline to return it."
2.0,"Compared to Oakley and Revant lenses, these are optically imperfect. Gave me a slight headache. Severe color shift depending on where you look through the lens. Perfect fit in the frames and very stylish, but I can’t get comfortable wearing them. Lesson learned: don’t be cheap where your vision is concerned."
2.0,I wanted toe less copper fit over the calf socks
2.0,Part of this jacket was not completely sewn together.  Returned it
2.0,"To be completely honest, I would not recommend this item for anyone considering it. It looks nothing like the picture, think construction worker overalls but very thin. I am considering returning it, but I would have to pay for the return so I don't even know if it's worth the trouble."
2.0,They get dull very fast
2.0,They came all wrinkled because they were extremely vacuum pack they are nothing but light belt and not worth anywhere near $15
2.0,"I knew things from China usually had really weird sizing, but this was super super small. I ordered the biggest size and it's probably a medium."
2.0,Beautiful polished stones! Took out of the package and placed it on my child's wrist and the bracelet snapped and released all the stones.  Disappointed
2.0,"Skirt was a decent material, however it was shorter than I would have liked."
2.0,"Top part was too big and body part seemed tight. It was cute but not worth it if you're on fence, unless you have prime and return will be free lol"
2.0,The fit is too small i ordered 3xl trying to get a comfortable size
2.0,This shirt was nothing like the picture and only came to my waist. I was a little disappointed in the fit.
2.0,The quaility of the shirt is very poor.
2.0,"Purchased this item to try out on my sunglasses and prescription glasses.  Product is two molded rubber pieces with a through-and-through hole.  The rubber down arm as seen in the picture is very soft rubber and basically does not add to retention.  The individual pieces have yet to fit on any of my collection of eyeglass frames.  I almost lost one due to the loose fit, in others too tight.<br />Since the down arm is merely soft rubber, eyeglass retention is dependent up rubber friction of the stem attached points.<br />Simply winding a rubber band around the stems would give the same results.<br />I don't recommend this product."
2.0,"I loved it when I first received, with that said it doesn't last long as it comes apart."
2.0,"So, I ordered this beautiful bathing suit in an XL, BUT when i opened the package i noticed immediately that it was WAY to big...and sure enough the size of it was XXXL WOW!  I know im plus size but definitely NOT THAT plus size. Obviously im working on a return right now and i wanted to order a smaller one, but they only have 1 left 4XL.  Moving onto the next.  But the bathing suit is really nice i was exited to try something different now that i had a baby recently and wanted more coverage.  Better luck next time i guess."
2.0,Not as pink as you promote it!!! Will be returning it
2.0,Need petite size. Length is too long. Zipper makes it impossible to modify length. If petite size were available I would purchase these again.
2.0,Horrible 1980’s glitter-like spandex.  No self-respecting adult would want to wear this.
2.0,"While the shirt is nice and soft, the ink faded after one wash. It was also much larger than I thought it would be. Overall disappointed and only be wearing this as a pj shirt from now on."
2.0,It looks to have an inner piece that would be secure around u then the outer cap. It doesn't. It's just a large wooly cap.
2.0,My glasses still fog up
2.0,"This is a lovely piece of jewelry.  Except, that it is scratchy.  I would suggest wearing this on, or over a shirt.  The necklaces that can with it are to scratchy can not wear them at all.  I use another necklace with the wound pendant.  I have not worn the heart pendant yet."
2.0,Very low cut. Very
2.0,fit was large and the fabric doesn't breathe at all.
2.0,"I liked the style of the shirt, but the fabric was not as I expected. it was a cheap fabric that was quite see through. I wouldn't suggest buying this product"
2.0,I was expecting a lil bigger
2.0,If you sell a  by product in the USA it should be with the sizing of what YSA uses. Not a size 14 USA is a size XXX3 in China. Too confusing and work.I really do not want to shop like this
2.0,"Padding was awkward and unnatural. You can remove padding, or put in thinner padding to make it look more natural, but I didn't bother."
2.0,"If your thinking that the spikes will be metal like the rest of the headband, beware. they are some sort of fluffy foamy stuff. totally throws off the product."
2.0,chain broke upon inspection<br />was giving for a Christmas gift - planed on returning<br />my daughter likes the colors so i guess i will keep it for her<br />have to buy a chain thou.
2.0,"It was beautiful when I got it.  Looked stunning in but after 2 days gems had fallen out and the ""plated gold"" had worn away becoming tarnished.  It is now beautifully sitting in a bag at the landfill."
2.0,It's pretty but doesn't want to lay correctly. It floods over to show the back of the flower more often then not. Given the price I shouldn't be surprised but it is unfortunate.
2.0,"Not my favorite, thinking of returning"
2.0,They look good but the part that goes between my toes felt horrible. I have many pairs of Reef flops that I love but not these.
2.0,"Uncertain how these mishaps happens.. With using measurements provided by seller along with the items visual aid- you’d think I should be on target with size.. Upon arrival top was smaller then expected and unfortunately the one I received has a twist in material at the neck.. problem is, its been sewn together this way- making the twist a permanent issue that can’t be fixed or laid flat.. As for sleeves- its as if bat wing has taken on a whole new meaning.. as these are not anything Close to the definition of the style! Sleeves almost seem to be attached too high up in the arm pit?? Photo shows a double length cuff at the wrist and this is shorter for sure.. definitely some of the features and details are missing on the top I received compared to photograph. Neck line is made with the reinforced collar as shown- but, it wears tighter around the neck so be aware.<br /><br />As for length- this hits below the cheek.. waistline is more gathered vs. relaxed like it is shown. I’d say it’s possible body type issue… but, not if I ordered according to this brands provided measurements?<br /><br />Overall, fit is smaller and unfortunate not to meet the needs I was expecting. Material is smooth but, NOT soft. It’s as if your running against the grain.. very deceiving bc, it looked so inviting. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend with so many discrepancies and if choosing to order… Be sure and size up and inspect that ut meets your needs. Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe!<br /><br />Included photos of twisted stitching- and shorter sleeve. For reference: ordered L.. I’m 5’2”, 153lb., 38c, 31x28.. trouble spot thru mid section- thanks to x4 kids and gravity!"
2.0,I ordered dark blue and a light blue/  gray showed up. Please be aware when placing your order. It's a decent product otherwise.
2.0,"I love the style and look of these boots however, they feel very cheap and some of the studs are white instead of silver. Over all they are comfortable but I am afraid of busting my a$$ in public if/when the heel breaks 😕"
2.0,"Really cute design, poor execution. Wore outdoors for a couple hours and this mask was not easy to breathe through, mainly due to the fabric."
2.0,Poor quality. Didn't like the cut.
2.0,The material was fine but the fabric on the shoulders was oddly bunched in a way that made it look like shoulder pads.
2.0,The tie is a lie. It has no lights or sound. It’s just a tie. It’s a cute tie but it’s not a high-quality tie or at all what was advertised.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these leggings. I wanted to love them. No, really. They are so soft, and felt super amazing. Obviously, as soon as I got home from class I ditched my pants for the black pair of these leggings. And I thought that I might never take them off because they just are that awesome. The high waist feels like heaven. The fit is as if they were made for me; not tight and not loose. Seriously, the Goldilocks of leggings! The ankles hit at my ankles. How does that even happen?! The outside is deliciously smooth, while the inside is like kittens hugging my legs. So, comfy leggings on, I sat down at the computer to read some news and rock out some homework. I did exactly (and only) that for 2 and a half hours. Then, I walked to the bathroom and when I pushed the leggings down... there was a hole in them. After only 2.5 hours of sitting almost entirely still. I'm terrified to even look at the other two pair that I ordered, much less try them on. With a heavy heart, I must return these and continue my search for clothes that can contain my booty for longer than 2 hours while keeping up with the overwhelming demands of my rather sedentary lifestyle. Two stars because the product would have been magical, if not for the remarkably short lifespan. First two photos are me being excited about new leggings! Third photo is me being severely, utterly disappointed."
2.0,"My 6yo son talked me into ordering these cheesy glasses, he used them once and has not touched them since."
2.0,"Bought for my 3yr old grandniece, she lost the backing the first time she wore them"
2.0,"I liked the color and style, but rose gold rubbed off fairly quick. So I cant wear them anymore."
2.0,Way too big even though I went down a size
2.0,"This watch looks good and fits good, but is not waterproof. Within the first week moisture built up in the watch and you could not see anything. My husband only washed his hands, did not wear it in water... it was just from the condensation."
2.0,The jacket was somewhat small and not as good a quality as I had hoped. The zipper is gold too and I had assumed from the photo it was silver.  I will return it as soon as I can figure out HOW- since there were no receipts or return info in the package
2.0,"NOT a good tote for securing all your 'stuff'!  Not just small things like keys and sunglasses can get out, but ALSO larger things like shoes!  No problem with the seller though."
2.0,I really like the way this jacket looked online but it look and the fit was not the same when it arrived. The fit was big and unfortunately there was a hole in one of the pockets. I decided to return and it just wasn’t worth it to try a smaller size.
2.0,"The belt is lovely to behold but when I put it on,I found out I could not take it off.  I  was almost tempted to cut it in two as I needed to go to the bathroom urgently but could not extricate myself form its grip. I struggled for a while to get it off my waist,  In frustration.I called Amazon for help and after many attempts the associate gave up.  She then suggested that I try and reverse the buckle while still wearing it and then use a screw driver to pry the belt loose from the buckle head.  I followed her instruction and was finally released from the &#34;imprisonment.&#34;  I was compelled to return it."
2.0,Fell apart and way too heavy to wear for any amount of time.
2.0,"The 18mm watch band is compatible with the Garmin Vivoactive 4s if you don't mind filing the plastic on the shoulders of the band ends to allow for the pins to align with the keepers. Also, 18mm is a little loose between the pin keepers making a double whammy disappointment. I guess that is the drawback on trying to manufacture a item for a large range of products. To be fair, I am not asking to return the band but will attempt to modify it for my needs. Edit 31 Aug 20: Filing the shoulder from 0.125"" to 0.105"" allows the band to fit."
2.0,Pretty design. Arrived on time. Did not fit. Was too small
2.0,This runs about 2 sizes small. Not cut for an American man.
2.0,"The color was vibrant, but the material was very poor quality, see through, and smelled a bit. It was worth $10, not the advertised fee. I returned this outfit."
2.0,Material is too thin.  I have two and I have not worn them because the material is paper thin.  Will not purchase again.
2.0,"3x fit on the bottom but top fits someone who has an A maybe a B cup , definitely doesn't fit D cup"
2.0,"The color is wrong, not even close to the one they showed online. The wig is supposed to have a widow’s peak (little V in the middle of the forehead) that wasn’t there, and the wig was all curled up on one side and in the back!  Very disappointed considering how much I paid I was expecting a little more from this wig. Will be returning it."
2.0,Nice pieces  but small. please check dimensions before purchase.
2.0,Poor quality and it doesn't look like the picture.. the material is silky almost and the pineapple is like ironed on.. I will probably never wear this..
2.0,Cool for taking pics.... other than that i wouldn't wear.
2.0,Cheap! Not made like pic.
2.0,This product came up when searching for women sizes.  I am almost 6 feet tall.  These leggings look like they are for children.  Very small.
2.0,Fabric was itchy and didn’t look as nice as the picture.
2.0,I really liked the comfort of these bands but I have had these new watch bands for my Garmin Vivoactive 4s for three days and two out of three days the pins lets go and my watch has fallen off.
2.0,The skirt is completely see-through. Would not recommend.
2.0,Not as advertised! The patch DOES NOT read as pictured. Simply says “NOMAD”. I like the statement pictured which the only reason I purchased this item. Disappointed.
2.0,"Maybe these are made for children; they're too short. And wider. I had a very hard time putting them on my watch and they hardly move (because it's too tight. As a result, it stays in lower position and the watch can't be charged on its cradle because the straps push it up."
2.0,"I have had 2 pairs of the GS Pro boots. My 1 pair I got in South Africa and within a year the innersole was done. I bought a second pair in USA and in less than 2 years I have repaired this pair twice. First the right sole comming loose now the left. I used glue and skrews and that seems to hold up better than what is used at the factory. This is the upper sole I am referring to, not the one that can be replaced. I dont even ride that often. Real disappointed."
2.0,It’s very small that it can only fit a child’s wrist. Color does not look like the image display. Don’t waste your money.
2.0,I kept my wig on a stand. I also was very gentle when I brushed it out but the hairs still fell out.
2.0,"Not a quality fabric, very cheap feeling"
2.0,Sent with a stain. Hassle to return or exchange for Christmas.
2.0,"Bought to use for motorcycle riding. Tested on a 50 degree morning. Thermal protection was okay, stayed in place, but did not help with preventing fog like others mentioned. Would not buy again"
2.0,The color was pretty.  The style okay.  Runs small.  The side drape is weirdly attached to the neck making it more like a scarf than a drape.  Material wasn't stretchy.
2.0,"My son got these masks to wear for trick or treating, he wore one to school to dress up for the party but before any trick or treating was done, neither of the masks would light up any longer. Batteries replaced but still nothing."
2.0,"The dress fit nicely, the colors were a bit unexpected.  I knew I was taking a chance....This brand does have a lot of nice cheap dresses that look fine but this one was a bit hideous in colors.  I will still buy the brand though."
2.0,"Fast shipping, arrived broken, overall quality decent for sunglasses this affordable. Processing return now :("
2.0,"I am very disappointed in these shoes. We LOVE Under Armour - my family lives in it, but these shoes are wearing very poorly. I have only been sending my son to daycare in them for about a week, and the treads are peeling and scuffed terribly already, so much do that even my husband (Mr. Oblivious) remarked about the wear on them. They're adorable, but I would not recommend them. The quality does not seem to be up the Under Armour standards."
2.0,Glasé are nice but ... dont like the shape
2.0,The loops will not stay latched onto the pom-poms resulting in the boot sliding off off all day
2.0,I have a small wrist so the lace is too long and overlaps awkwardly on the other side. Also a light would be very useful for night time or just darkness in my room
2.0,The sunglasses are not rose gold colored or mirrored as the seller reported them to be.
2.0,"Like the dress - the material and color, but it is noticeably poorly made. It will be returned."
2.0,"Very doubtful this is Coach.  After researching, I've not found this scarf sold anywhere by Coach.  It's cute, but certainly not worth the money I paid."
2.0,it looked like paper
2.0,"large button type earrings and the cat is so far down that unless you have the earrings at your nose, you cannot tell what you are looking at."
2.0,Only reason I've giving a gracious 2 stars is the quality of the hoodie is good. However!! If you decide to buy one of these sweatshirts these run small. I got a large and it was more like a small. I had  to look at the tag because I thought the sent me the wrong size.
2.0,Horrible quality! Beautiful show but the glitter comes off real easy and a couple of days of use and they look worthless.
2.0,I gave this to my wife as a stocking stuffer and it broke within a month. I tried to reattach but she gave up wearing it. It was very economically priced....
2.0,I am trying to size up so I decided to buy these in a 0g... they either run small or they just don’t have good grip. They are constantly falling off. Very pretty and light weight.
2.0,"This size is way big. I ordered a small and probably could have used an extra extra small. It definitely doesn't drape like the pictures show, but I am planning on adding a loose belt to see if it helps the flow and draping a bit. It's quite soft and comfy, but just not as expected."
2.0,"Loved it.However, not nfl approved.<br /> Had to throw away purse at game entrance. Purse not allowed. Not NFL approved."
2.0,"Big fan of merrys products usually. Very disappointed when I received these. They were meant as a gift but as i saw how cheap and crappy these are - I will have to return them. For what its worth I'll probably be trading them for another Merry's pair. The folding feature also just works to make them crappier as well, as they do not cleanly or neatly fold up. Good for ladies that like the Ozzy look."
2.0,There slipped look great but no cushion for your feet . Going to return them.
2.0,"its Not purple. The photo looks Purple. There is a Paul Malone RedLine that is Purple.  this one is clearly labeled Pink. Which was my mistake.. its a mix of Pink and Fuchsia.<br />  I own 4 different colors of this tie.  I get the most compliments when I wear them.<br />For the most part all the colors have been slightly off from the photos. Mainly a bit lighter in tone..<br />its Pink that shimmers Fuchsia.  still a great tie, just Not Purple."
2.0,the looks like a 99 cent item.  Paid 10.99.  The packaging is great.  I would like to send back for credit.  looks better in photo
2.0,El producto estaba en malas condiciones.
2.0,They are made poorly and keep popping out and hanging loose. I would not recommend.
2.0,"Very nice sweater, unfortunately too small, and no larger size available.  returned for refund"
2.0,The picture does not depict the actual size. They are very very very small
2.0,"Does not fit well, crown is molded but not to shape of head"
2.0,The fabric seems alot more of a sweater and not as lightweight in person. Also the color is a more light light blue and doesn't look like the color on the model. I am returning it. Also it fits too tight to the body and for me is not flattering.
2.0,"This sweater looks greats but, it gets pulls very easily. I'm disappointed. I haven't even gotten to wear it yet, I just took it out of the package and I noticed that it has 2 large pulls in the fabric. It's a very thin sweater."
2.0,The sleeves were a little short
2.0,I had bought this same brand and size as a single pair and it was so great. This pack of 3 was disappointing because it was a smaller fit than expected and was not the same type of material.
2.0,Decent pair of shades. However the lense was loose and clicks. somewhat annoying... nothing some superglue won't fix. :/
2.0,"Once I got the right size (reordered another pack), they work great, but there aren't really any instructions on how to measure."
2.0,"I would like this if it were clean. Mine arrived and while the stone looks pretty, the silver ring itself is black. Not very attractive.  I've added pics next to another 925 silver ring.  Big difference."
2.0,The liner is loose and baggy no compression
2.0,I knew they wouldnt be real opals (although the photos claim that they are)...but I expected them to look very realistic. They did not by any stretch look real. They were so obviously fake and poorly placed in the setting. I'm returning them. For costume jewelry they would be passable.
2.0,Arms too long length of shirt too short
2.0,Fabric is very stiff
2.0,Lasted one week<br />Then split open  not worth buying
2.0,"Runs small, fabric felt cheap."
2.0,"First wash the black part leaked purple onto the white stripes. Looks dull & blotchy. Love the way it fits & cloth is comfy, but looks terrible"
2.0,"Arrived with black marks all over the tikka. The earrings are EXTREMELY heavy, there is no way I could ever wear these. Heavy earrings are not unusual in Indian style jewelry, but these are much heavier than any others I have worn. I returned this set."
2.0,It reminds me of the polyester leisure suits from the 1970's. It would match nothing I own.
2.0,"I love the band, feels great wearing it.  The color doesn't match correctly but it is close enough.  My biggest issue is the color is already coming off and I have only been wearing it for 2 weeks :(  That part is very disappointing."
2.0,"I gave this two and not one because customer service was GREAT. However, the keychain looks nice but is not worth $10.00. I had it two days and it fell apart in my pocket. I would return it but they had sent me the wrong one to begin with and the one I returned fell apart in my hands. I decided to keep the bottom half and just use it as a regular keychain instead of a two piece chain."
2.0,"The bracelets are ok but the black one looks a bit on the cheap side, too shiny like plastic. I feel like they are overpriced for the look but they seem to be made ok and fit our wrists well."
2.0,"The shoes are lightweight and breathable. However, after 2 wears the logo on the side of one shoe is peeling off. It would be completely off if it weren’t for the fact that the bottom of the “swish” is sealed into the sole."
2.0,"It's very bulky and has a lot of wasted space.  The cards fit nicely in the middle of the clutch with about an inch of 'nothing' space, unusable space on either side of the card slots.  I would not purchase this item again."
2.0,gave to my daughter
2.0,"I purchased these earrings twice, because the metal backing on the first pair, broke off after several times of wearing them - lo and behold, the same thing happened to the second pair.  The back metal part requires bending to fit and stay put on your ear. I wish that didn't happen (twice), because they really are pretty earrings, they look better in person, and I received many compliments."
2.0,Clip-ons are good quality but MUCH darker than shown on the website.
2.0,It's so cute and delightful but the strap broke after about a week of light usage.
2.0,"Didn't fit, waiting for refund."
2.0,I'll be sewing mine too for properly... I think these are meant for really wide feet i think... Oh well nothing a hand in sewing can't mend 🤣
2.0,Extremely small. Very nice quality and fabric feels wonderful. I ordered XL and these are smaller than the juniors mediums I have from JCPenny (flirtitude).<br /><br />Now I just have to find a 13 year old girl to give them to without it being weird because there's no way I will ever fit into them.
2.0,Really nice keychain but the part that connects to your keys is week so that’s why I’m only giving it 2 stars. It broke off and got lost after about 2 months. If you buy a different connector for your keys it would be perfect. The product itself is nice and the engraving was perfect. Overall a really nice gift but had to give it to stars because it fell off after 2 months and is now lost somewhere.
2.0,"The case was nice however, it was missing the cleaning cloth even though it was part of the description on the packaging it came in."
2.0,Rather complicated as talking watches go. Should be more user friendly... and Hello people using this dont see well.... so make the directions in large print? Duh?!? How about back lighting? Much room for improvement.  The look of this one was appealing but the reality..... not so much.
2.0,"I'm so upset because this is SUPER cute but the cups just don't fit at all. It's a soft mesh material with structured boning and the ribbon bows are really nice. I'm 5'1"", my waist is 29"", my hips are 34"" and I'm a 34DD (32DDD). I got the XL as a precaution, literally because my bust is so large and the cups were STILL too small. It was too loose at the waist and hips but way too tight around the band and the built-in cups were waaay too small. I ordered this for Halloween so idk what I'm gonna do now for my costume looool."
2.0,"When I first got this dress I loved it. It fit great, was very soft and had pockets! But within a couple washes the color had faded and the material pilled all over. I can wear it around the house but won’t be able to wear it for errands or work as I intended when I bought it."
2.0,I wasn't able to use them because they were very tight on my nose. One of the glasses came scratched up.
2.0,"I purchased a pack of 288 stick on earrings. What I received was a pack of 160, over 100 earrings short! While what I received made my niece happy and the earrings do stay on for a few hours, I’m disappointed that I didn’t receive all the earrings that I paid for."
2.0,The floral pattern is very pretty but the fabric is too thin. I am 5'8&#34; and this dress barely covered my rear. I returned the dress.
2.0,these are not made for the average females ear....they are very tiny ....would perhaps work for a child
2.0,Super small- had to send back. They are really cool looking however!
2.0,The fit wasn't true to the size. It ran a little bigger than expected
2.0,"I am 110 pounds and 5’4”<br />I wear a small 2/4 in womens and ordered a LARGE<br /><br />I wish I had gotten an XL😖<br /><br />Photos show that the legs are 5”+ too short for me<br />Photos show the arms are 4” too short for me<br />Photos show the neck was cut and sewn incorrectly, the fabric doesn’t lay flat<br /><br />What I couldn’t show you is that the waist on the large is SNUG! Too snug actually.<br />One leg is shorter and hemmed at a diagonal<br /><br />These are PETITE!! Do not buy if you’re tall"
2.0,not  a new watch as expected
2.0,They are not pink or round.
2.0,Top waa too small and awkwardly shaped
2.0,The turquoise fell out first time I put it on
2.0,Took forever for this to come. Very cheaply made.
2.0,"My butt did not change at all, it did not lift it or make my stomach look thinner. The only thing that the waist makes it look smaller but otherwise I am very disappointed and I do not recommend it"
2.0,"Great looking watch. It looks premium. However, the dial for changing the date won't work in mine. I have to move the watch 24 hours ahead to change the date to the next day, for example."
2.0,Too small and too short and not really like photos shown.
2.0,"The patterns and fit are lovely and flattering, but the fabric... I thought I was getting some carefree summer dresses, the kind you can throw on and look good in without a second thought - and the do look good, but wearing in feels like walking around in a plastic bag. I know, I should have been more attentive to the fabric, but the high reviews swayed me. I found these unbearable for summer days, when the last thing you want is to feel like your body is encased in a coffin of non-breathable, man-made fiber.<br />They also have a sheen, as most polyester apparel does, the same shininess of a cheap suit. I found the black floral dress disguises this much better than the light floral, and the light tie-dye is just impossible - it looks like a flammable nightgown from the 1970s.<br />I wish I could find dresses that fit as well in cotton - cool, natural, breathable cotton - that would be perfect."
2.0,The zipper comes off to easy
2.0,"Colorful but after 3 wash , a little toe hole .. Will not buy again.plus one of the stock are extremely to small."
2.0,These were a little small for my 10yr old daughter.
2.0,Very uncomfortable. Material is like sandpaper.
2.0,"I would have to say this piece is very pretty, the main reason for my return is that i was unsatisfied with the size of the piece. If you are looking for the larger victorian style cameo pendants, this one is not for you. It is very small and quaint and would be better for a childrens necklace."
2.0,Stone not centered on all of them. Blue and green stones look the exact same. Stone is thick and sticks out far from nose
2.0,"Cute, but too large for my wrist and not adjustable."
2.0,Hold smoke Batman is this outfit BAGGY! My baby is 13 months and I ordered her a L because atm she is in 12-18 and it goes almost below her knees. Nice material very light weight and stretchy but man is it baggy. Head band is adorable though!
2.0,"Very cheap looking, but it was a cheap purchase so I suppose that &#34;justifies&#34; it."
2.0,These look green and not in a good way.  For price not bad but they aren't black.  Not as pictured.
2.0,So far they are great lights are bright only issue is the remote does not always work..not even a month in only wore in inside places three times three leds are out how can we did this issue?
2.0,These Look nice online & Very Cheap looking in person - these would be good for a grade school - I returned them
2.0,"I got the package and it felt very light, then when I opened it there was only the skirt in the package. So disappointing.  So I basically paid $90 for a polyester skirt (which by the way was cute) and did not get the belt or bra."
2.0,"I ordered this twice, but both were defective. Completely disappointed because the bathing suit is really cute and fits true to size"
2.0,Not for my body shape!
2.0,Ridiculously small......
2.0,I absolutely loved these earrings. I will even say that they were my favorite pair. I wore them everyday for 2 weeks. (I always take my earrings out before bed) Then one day the post came unstuck to the earring. It broken my heart. The price was so good and the earrings were beautiful. I guess some things are too good to be true
2.0,The belt buckle broke the first time I wore this belt.  The fabric of the belt itself is good and sturdy.
2.0,"Only three out of four of these worked when they arrived. My dogs kind of hate them, as they bob around like crazy when clipped to their collars for evening walk. We ended up clipping them to the leash handles to reduce doggie angst."
2.0,It’s very cute. Love the pattern. But I’m still after two days having it cannot seem to get it to hook with my watch. Very disappointed that it doesn’t work.
2.0,Wanted to review so people can know what to expect. I had high hopes for this mask as many reviews stated it helped minimize acne and it’s breathable…false I can’t say whether or not it helped with acne which is the reason for 2 stars but it’s hard to breathe with this mask on and it sucks in when you speak or take a breath. It is light weight I give it that!
2.0,It was not what It looked like in the pic.
2.0,thinner/more flimsy than expected
2.0,La camiseta está bonita pero es muy grande
2.0,Pants fit perfect but they have streeks ! So not happy with product.
2.0,"These were beautiful but literally 2 hours after wearing they started discoloring, which I expected some since its copper.  But it’s very inconsistent and has some black areas so it just doesn’t look right.  I wasted $75 on something I won’t wear again.  😢"
2.0,"I had high expectations for this corset, but I certainly regret buying it. First of all it is not tight enough in the actual waist although it is snug at the hips and below the breast line. It is a bit too long I tried tightening it and it looks stretched out now. One of the bones in the course it is already popping out the bottom and I've only worn it three times. I wear a size 6 jeans and I bought a size 2XL."
2.0,Bit on the small side for men
2.0,Does not we come with battery’s cheap do not buy
2.0,It was a bit too snug and way too long.
2.0,Wherever the fabric stretched (even the slightest) it faded in color. Did not fit at all as shown or described.<br />I gave it 2 stars because it was was a pretty pattern and soft material
2.0,"Nice concept, poor execution.  I've bought 3 of these in less than a year and my husband has gone through each of these.  The material is raveling. The black part unravels and the head of the wallet bends - crushing the entry/head of the wallet. I really wish they could figure out a solution for this because we loved the wallet, but won't purchase anymore."
2.0,"The bulldog logo was an iron on instead of raised stitching.  Was disappointed, maybe I should have read a little more into the description."
2.0,Cheaply made- low quality. Deep wrinkles in the hat that won’t come out.
2.0,Is flat not puffy like the picture at all.  Not what I thought I had ordered. It okay. But I’m not impressed!!
2.0,I sent back.
2.0,Kind of cheap - wrinkles easily
2.0,"Not long sleeve,only quarter sleeve and rode up on my daughters bottom."
2.0,It started chipping really quick and the small band that holds down the other band broke quickly. Not worth the money
2.0,Doesnt look at all like advertised
2.0,Not a fan of fabric or fit
2.0,"Cheap material for the cost, but son loves  it!"
2.0,"Very tiny. barly fits,more for a baby."
2.0,"Not very colorful, very dull"
2.0,"It looks cute. Ordered an XL but it runs super small. It is probably more of a Medium size. It wont even go up past my thights. So if you are looking to buy this, you need to get 2 sizes up. The material is also thin."
2.0,"For real, I wanted to return this but it required cost on my part and too many steps. The pattern is great, but it’s printed sloppily on terrible material. It feels like a bathing suit or Halloween costume on the outside and microfiber on the inside."
2.0,"This item was returned, the red one is almost orange, the colors do not match the product at all. Not what I was expecting!"
2.0,Make sure you’re sure of the size.
2.0,They were cute as first. After moving around with them for two hours they became very loose and baggy.
2.0,"This one gave me uniboob.  Wanted to like it, the style is simple but darling, but the fit on top was all wrong.  This is going to be a big hit or miss, depending on your bra and midsection.  For my 40B chest size, it did not work."
2.0,This product is far smaller than I expected. It is tight and clingy. I’m sending it back.
2.0,runs very small and very clingy.  cute but very small
2.0,"The quality seemed good and the shoes looked beautiful and glittering like I imaged. However, they are too small and my daughter was disappointed. Will try to see if I can exchange for a bigger pair from the seller."
2.0,"Scratched very easily and they were very dark compared to other mirrored/polarized glasses. Bought these for a trip to Europe, which would be a lot of walking around outside. They scratched before we even got on the plane. And were so dark that i frequently went without."
2.0,It’s ok. Kinda a faded black. Supposed to look weathered. Looks messy. I carry it but I’m not crazy about it.
2.0,Build quality is fine but stains my things and smells horrific.
2.0,VERY small frame
2.0,"The shirt seems nice and I'm a bit disappointed. I bought a 3xl after seeing that others said it was too small. However, this is like a 3x that you'd find in the child's section. That's a slight exaggeration but I normally wear 2x and have a bit of room to spare. I couldn't even get the shirt to close, let alone button."
2.0,I wouldn't classify this as a dress. I would sat it's more like a costume. The fabric is super shiny. Kind of like a trash bag feel.
2.0,Gifted these to my much smaller sister-in-law. These are definitely not forgiving and have a chemically smell. I'm 5'3&#34; and 125 pounds. These made me look like a whale rather than flatter any part of my lower half.
2.0,"Received shoes sooner than expected, which was great but then...ordered my size, 12, look & feel of shoe was fine but as I tried them on;right shoe was a little snug, which was ok(figuring a little time & wear would solve that)but left shoe almost felt like it was a size smaller!!! What the hell??! I then made sure shoes were same size-both marked 12 & look to be the same. Although, I'm sure my brain is making it seem when I look @ the left compared to the right, it SEEMS smaller! I'm a big fan of LUGZ shoes but this is crazy. I won't buy these again & haven't sent them back because I feel it'd take too long for them to be received & a larger size resent. Using shoe trees in them to hopefully help my problem."
2.0,Very pretty but way too small.
2.0,"Strap started to peel and crack, only after a short time , I would pass on this item"
2.0,I had to keep these in the dryer for over 2 hours. I increased the heat and had to remove everything else that became overly dry and yet they had to keep going. It wound up shrinking the rubber ankle strap. Always hated crocs yet I bought them for my toddler anyways. I blame myself.
2.0,Not fitted at all just a strait dress
2.0,"Bought to take to Mexico, and within a week it was unraveling. No longer wearable, too bad because it was a great hat to strut along in. No bueno"
2.0,As soon as I pulled the sweater out it was already ripped from elbow to wrist. And there were long human hair attached to the shoulder.
2.0,"I didn't realize this order wasn't full filled by Amazon, missed that all together.  I wanted to return it because the material is scratchy and the shape was like the really old, old days, it was a cone shape.  I just ended up donating it."
2.0,Super super small fitting.  Heavy material - too hot feeling for me.  I got a small and I'm a size 4...:(
2.0,The shades look meh on my face.  Not sue why I bought them
2.0,Ok purchase not very comfortable!
2.0,I had to return them as half of them were unusable. They had bubbles in them or they were scratched and some were chipped. I suppose they are fine for magnets or things that don't matter if they are faulty but for the Jewelry I make the bubbles and scratches and chips would take away from the item and make it look cheap. I ordered other sizes from them as well and will be returning them since they seem to be the same quality. At least the return process was easy and they don't seem to be charging me for return shipping.
2.0,doesn't run true to size
2.0,Unfortunately it takes longer for shipment than listed and the sizing is smaller than anticipated.
2.0,Runs really large ... way too big for my wrist .... and no strap to hold extra strap down also not curved where it connect to watch face causing an unsightly gap
2.0,These are cute but super small smaller than I thought so that's disappointing
2.0,I loved the first Copper Fit Compression Socks I ordered. I just received a second order; the compression is not as good as with my first pair.
2.0,The size chart is designed for women without curves and breast. The sizing if you go up a size is still to small or excessive tight for a curvy women. The fabric is not of the best quality for the price. The garment wear is very limited due to the stated reason.
2.0,The product itself is great and fine... But it has a horrible odor. I have orders these from another seller and did not have this problem
2.0,"Don't any look like opal. No iridescence at all, just flat blue."
2.0,After wash and drying and gentle the trunk so much I could not wear again
2.0,Don't waste your $$. Poor quality
2.0,"Quality is ok. Nothing special, but reasonable price for what you get."
2.0,Disappointed really.  The style and cut is really nice but the fabric is not what I expected  seems over priced to me. If I could I'd return it.
2.0,These were too large -- I usually wear an 8N.
2.0,These boba charms are cute but I’m extremely disappointed because I did not receive some of the colors shown
2.0,Fell apart after about 2 months!
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, especially since they’re machine washable.  Sadly, I just didn’t find them that comfortable. The sole padding is minimal. And the crisscross elastic, though cute, pushed my foot too far back in the shoe. For $20, sure, I’d like them, but $100+? No way. That’s Cole Haan money. I sent them back."
2.0,"I felt like I had on a tent.  I expected over- sized but this heavy material hung like a dress.  Despite the over-sizetop  the band around the upper arm was tight on my large arms.  The color was a deep coral, almost but not quite red.  I wanted it for Christmas so that was OK. The material was very heavy almost like a tote bag is the only way I can think to describe it.  I am about 195 and 5'5"" and it was more like a bathing suit cover-up length."
2.0,"PROS:<br />- Very loose, gives me space after pregnancy<br />- Not too short<br /><br />CON:<br />- Color darker than expected<br />- Material is not as soft"
2.0,I got caught in the rain and the fabric puckered all up.  I will dry clean it and see if it will be repaired.  Dress fit as expected.
2.0,She wears size 9 and had to order a size 11.
2.0,Not what I expected. Runs big.
2.0,Yellow green dial which is not attractive.  Looks and feels very cheap.  Sent it back.
2.0,"I was so excited when I found this shirt online. After reading reviews, I decided to order a size larger than I wanted (as sizes were said to run small) and order it in white. When the shirt arrived, the screen print was stuck together, as if melted. The shirt did not run small, and the white is see-through. It is still adorable, but I am very disappointed with this purchase."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:e5c727aef6cfe53f7848d6a5b429c3b2]] The shoes are so beautiful! I love them but they put the wrong shoe size inside the box it was suppose to be size 9 and got an 8. I will return them and hopefully get the right size
2.0,Great for babies with wide feet.
2.0,"Delivery was excellent and came sooner than expected! The choker is exactly as described! But the charm is cheap to me, all the pepperonis aren't painted and it is also bent! Doesn't look like picture! I bought this choker Bc of the cool charm .. I'm disappointed"
2.0,"I ordered a medium because the reviews said it ran small. I normally wear a small, it is very fitted on a size medium. Doesn’t fit like the picture shows. The material is very soft though."
2.0,Cute jacket but has defects. Jacket does not zip all the way when both are put together. Snap is too close to zipper:
2.0,"Not even a sweater. It is made of t-shirt material and cheap thin material at that. I followed the sizing from the reviews, and it was still.way too small. Thankfully, i could turn right around and give to my mom. Early Christmas for her!"
2.0,I like the style. But Fabric is too thin. Disappointed.
2.0,"Returning. Tested over 2 weekends and ultimately was not impressed at all. If these lenses do transition I couldn't tell the difference and I own a pair of prescription glasses that transition. The arms dug into the back of my head (22""/ medium helmet) causing a headache. And finally, which I'll take partial blame for, is that they aren't ""clear"" lenses at any point which means police would assume I'm wearing shades while riding at night.<br />Plus side... they do look cool and zero wind interference."
2.0,"These reviews are LIES,LIES,LIES!!! They’re not otc. Very hit or miss as far as quality goes. Sometimes the reinforced toe area  is too large and sometimes they’re too small. They’re mid calf at best. When I first put them on I was impressed by the softness and seemingly durable manufacturing. The elastic band and reinforced toe are easily ruined. Pulling them up caused a multiple runs. I bought 3 pairs. In one day only I’m down to one sock. Just one. The rest failed."
2.0,Pants fit well and looked nice. Size chart is accurate. Pants are very thin. I ordered the grey and was sent army green. The description says elastic drawstring hem. There was no drawstring hem of any kind. Just a straight leg hem. Returned them and had to wait a week for a refund.
2.0,"Does not fit like the photo - the sleeves aren’t extra long, it’s not a casual and loose fit and it honestly looks like it’s a different fabric than what’s in the photo. The color matches pretty well and it’s comfortable."
2.0,By Brown they mean red. It is 100% red around the lenses and down the sides.
2.0,The material is thin but not see threw. The length is great and it stretches great. The elasticity around ur chest is to loss tho.
2.0,"Based on the descriptions  and some of the reviews, we were expecting a bag with roomy compartments.  We had opted to purchase this over the less expensive bags because those bags seemed to have tight pockets.<br /><br />This bag has tight pockets, and the interior compartments do not provide adequate storage unless the items are slim.  The front pocket has an upper flap that causes you to work a little to insert a tablet.<br /><br />We will continue our search for a more roomy and economical alternative."
2.0,Sent back.  Very thin and cheap looking!!!
2.0,Nice soft sweatshirt but the graphic is very like rubbery and doesn’t seem like it’s going to be durable for washing but we will see. It’s like a rubber sticker.
2.0,Sizes aren't right.
2.0,The medium is more like a small. It’s a little see through but altogether it’s an okay look.
2.0,"Don't reach my thighs, a little too short (I'm 5'5 127, size 6)"
2.0,It ran on small side and I am 5’2 and it was a little short.
2.0,"My wife found it a bizarre style in person, even though she liked the look of it on the product page. The material feels very cheap and has the look of some sort of vintage blazer, but not in a good way. It has a belt which makes it seem like it should be dressed up, but it isn't nice enough to wear with that sort of wardrobe.<br />It's sort of a neither here-nor-there sort of outfit, we feel like it is having an identity crisis and doesn't know what it wants to be.<br />Likely never going to wear out. Giving it 2 stars because maybe there's a chance someone somewhere will find it nice enough to use for something... maybe a costume?"
2.0,It was crazily made.....too small sent back
2.0,Shrank 20% after cold water washing. Could no longer wear it..was XXL. Found better blend workout hoodie at WMT
2.0,"Looks like cotton-ish material right? Wrong. Mine's silk. And even though it's comfortable as hell, you'll notice that it looks like the boob area has no seems all thw way up? Wrong again. There's seems all the way to the collar line. So thanks alot for that-I wont be returning it cuz its comfy-but wont be wearing it in public like i hoped. It'll be a high class shxt-kicker as far as I'm concerned. And order a size down if ya want the top to look ""huggy"" but bottom to flare yet compliment your butt. :) / :/"
2.0,"I purchased these for my 3 yr old and they are too large and bulky for his hands, and don't stay on.  He doesn't like to wear them b/c they are awkward and fall off, so they were a waste of money."
2.0,"The fit is true to size and rise is fine, but the material is super thin. And lump, bump or dimple you may have will certainly be visible in these."
2.0,Very cute but ran way too small. Returned.
2.0,the pattern looked faded and used which is not what I expected.  I expected a new dress.
2.0,"Zipper broke as soon as I put the dress on. It has a very thin zipper, which is flimsy. Surprising because the material of the dress was good quality otherwise. Very upset with the purchase."
2.0,Very cute.<br /><br />But after wearing for only about a month it started to tarnish and turn black.
2.0,"This look nice, but mine broke the first time I tried to put it on my tie. The pin was not attached to the body very well. RR"
2.0,"Cheap, break easily. The designs are cute but the jewelry is heavy. Okay for costumes maybe."
2.0,This is very cute BUT is VERY small.
2.0,"This product comes in a little tin with two charging cables.  Unfortunately, they would not stay plugged in to  my Fitbit Charge.  They would charge it, but I had to hold the plug in place otherwise it just fell out."
2.0,It was good quality and looked nice BUT it arrived broken because it was packaged very badly. I was shocked when I saw the package because anyone could tell it cannot have made it in perfect shape. I’ll try to glue it back together.
2.0,Washed ONCE per instructions and they shrunk pretty bad.
2.0,size was wrong
2.0,"Came crooked, looks extremely cheaply made. i wouldn't mind if it was 4 bucks, but i can get a better one for the same price."
2.0,It didn’t meet my expectations
2.0,Disappointing. The day and date are too tiny see easily
2.0,"Love yoga pants with pockets, but after a couple washes they are see through, so I have to wear with another pair of leggings under...not great for summer."
2.0,"To small, it fits more for a woman"
2.0,"Fits terribly especially If you are not 6ft tall and slender. Bunches around the neck, the lumbar support doesnt hit the right part of the body for support especially as it relates to the location of the frame. Feels cheap and fragile like it's going to bust under normal strain.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"Nice, but the sewing wasn't the best.."
2.0,They were SUPER cute!!! But they fit way tooo smal... Im usually like a 34 B... So I bout a medium.... Noooo😖😖😖😖😖 I had to return them!!!!! So when I tried to reorder a bigger size... They didn't have any 😥😰😱... So make sure yu size up ladies 👯👯👙
2.0,Dress is cute with nice design but the material is completely see through. So see through that even without it on you can see through both layers of fabric.
2.0,Smaller than expected....material not very good quality.
2.0,"Thin, color was meh in person."
2.0,Skirt length was a lot shorter than expected; when I think 1950s I presume below the knee.  Not very flattering even though it fits right.
2.0,"I am an extra large girl.  My neice is a somewhat a cup small. It fit her... perfectly.  Beyond upset and disappointed with this product.  If you sell in an American market, please look at our breast sizes as opposed to your amazing but tiny Asian women.  We want to buy from you. But we have bigger ribcages and um... yes... boobies.  Get a healthy Caucasian and selling to america... use this girl as your guide.  More fabric.  Ok. We pay more.  Xo"
2.0,"Very cute on model but not in person. The design of the actual dress varies slightly from photo, especially the sleeves. The fabric is very light and thin, looks like cheap table cloth. I ordered xl, I wear a 12/14 normally. Dress was very tight on the upper half on the arms and breast areas. Somewhat too loose and bulky on the lower bottom half of the dress. I would return but not worth hassle. I don't recommend."
2.0,This is a cute top but not loose fitting as advertised especially for the curvy bodied girls with tatas.  The fit is snug from shoulders to waist and I ordered what they call a 2X.  Not a loose spot anywhere.  Returned.
2.0,Was looking for a white scarf. Was more of a cream. Also the fabric felt like bed sheets and was kind of stiff. Returned.
2.0,Sooooo small. Almost youth sized
2.0,Very disappointed. After about 5 trips the large bags wheels broke and it got a large crack in one of the sides. I know tsa doesn't treat anyone's stuff with respect but it should have atleast lasted a year. If your looking to buy this luggage I'd look else where it was a waste of money
2.0,It is beautiful but didn't last long before tarnishing. I wore it for about a month before I noticed discoloration on my skin and the metal.
2.0,"Order a size up, or 2 maybe. It shrinks a lot in the wash."
2.0,The material is cheap and it keeps wet
2.0,Diseño para hombre noesverdad muy demaciado pequeño es para un niño
2.0,Used it for couple of weeks.. stated see the ware immediately after the first week not good leather.
2.0,"It looks like it is nice quality,however the sizing runs very very small.. I would suggest going up 2 to 3 sizes if buying from the United States, example, xl fits like a medium.. 4xl fits like a tight 2x.."
2.0,We didn't like the weak plastic material used on these frames. This brand has much stronger fit overs available.
2.0,Looks cheap looking
2.0,did not receive cufflinks or pocket square with tie
2.0,"I own 2 pair of these shorts in a size 8 in blue denim. They fit wonderfully and I love them. Decided to duplicate that perfect Size 8 in white. First of all, received 8P instead of 8 which was annoying AND then couldn’t begin to stuff myself into them. They are definitely legit GV instead of knockoffs but NO stretch anywhere in the white version that I could find. The fabric is very different from the blue denim versions so WATCH OUT if you’re expecting the same fit. For reference, I’m 5’6” and weight 153lbs with no butt to speak of.<br /><br />Returning was a breeze so no complaints there."
2.0,Fits weird. Thin material
2.0,"Discolored and caused a rash on my wife's neck. Gift idea for major accomplishment gone wrong. At least she's not mad at me, just a little disappointed."
2.0,El paquete no trajo la cantiad de pantalas que dice en la orden.
2.0,"Considering I got 3x size and the shirts are snug as a 1x I'm glad I read the reviews. But I was most disappointed at the material and the (claim of being light weight and breathable)<br /> The garment performs well at sun blocking, but it far from breezy. The hood is a perfect size for me considering I wear it under a hardhat."
2.0,"The earrings themselves are very pretty, but I purchased them as a gift and didn't realize they came broken until they opened them. Time had past and nothing could be done. The hoop material is easily breakable apparently."
2.0,"Good enough for the night, chain broke as i tried to put it on, lucky for me, it broke close to the end so i could still make it work."
2.0,"We ordered these for a project. We needed about 95 charms and thought this bag of 100 would meet our needs perfectly. Unfortunately there were only 88 charms in the bag. It looks like other buyers have had the same issue. The charms are cute, but the quality control Is lacking."
2.0,"The same company made the Comfort Luxury Slippers Leather House Shoes and they fit fine. However, these are way too big. The length of the shoe is okay, but the height of the toe part is way too tall. The slipper doesn't stay on. I even tried putting an insert in it but it's still way too big. They need to remove at least half an inch from the height of the top part where your foot slides in to make it snug enough to stay on your foot."
2.0,Slim wallet but the inside lining came apart on day 3. Also felt like I had to wrestle my cards from the outside pockets.
2.0,"Feels like something made from a parachute. Outside looks ok, but since this has shorter front, seems inside matter, and they are very obvious. This would be good for costume wear OR if a petticoat of sorts was used with it, which for a goth look, might actually be pretty ok…"
2.0,"Great purse - I like how it looks and I like the design.<br />I'd rate it higher, but the long strap broke within 30 seconds of my using it. Spilled my purse contents all over the street in front of my apartment on my way to work!<br />It was the metal clip on one side that cracked into pieces. I still use the purse but I am looking for a more durable one currently."
2.0,the picture shows a very shiny bracelet...it&#34;s not...... the one I received looks dull and worn.......but I was buying it cause it stated....... NEW
2.0,"The hook mechanism is defective.  Unfortunately I didn’t find that out until after the return period. They are pretty, but I can’t wear them:-("
2.0,Disappointed with wear just didn’t hold ip
2.0,"The band is really nice and fits well, but it's too big for the Fitbit and it keeps trying to pop out. I've had it one day"
2.0,It could've been just me but these were a terrible fit...  I sent them back for a refund
2.0,"Looks cute,<br />Shorts underneath skirt run very large ."
2.0,Too small suppose to be a xl fits like a medium
2.0,"The eye, nose and mouth holes do not line up with our faces. My daughter and I both tried them out. The placement was off enough to be uncomfortable. We will not be wearing."
2.0,Not as deligate as it looks on line Big and kinda gaudy
2.0,Runs very large!! Not much breast support.
2.0,Stitching was loose.
2.0,"So I'm a large, full figure gal. This bra provides ZERO support. I might as well be going out with no bra. Can't use it. Will be donating to Goodwill."
2.0,These run kind small. I suggest sizing up. The sleeves are super narrow and have little stretch. Trust me on this. Just size up one.
2.0,Not compression socks
2.0,Too tight and big at the same time.
2.0,The top was too small; I didn't like the material either.
2.0,"The cut of the neck was awkward and if you have wide shoulders, this isn’t the shirt for you"
2.0,Dislike<br />Poor quality
2.0,"I can't argue with the value price of this item.  But it saddened me to see that the EMBLEM,  the most important feature,  was just an Iron-On Decal.  No embroidery.  I worry that it will peel off with just age/wear."
2.0,This dress is completely see through because it is not double lined. If you are going to order it be prepared to have to find something to where underneath it.
2.0,It’s not as delicate as it looks in the picture. The chain is thicker and so is the metal and it’s a bright gold color.
2.0,This is poorly made. It doesn't fit it's difficult to try and wear and makes your boobs fall down more. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.
2.0,not my favorite jewelry set I've purchased. these piercings are very small in size. they aren't the most comfortable and the balls on the ends are very hard to unscrew. won't be buying these again but the colors were all very nice.
2.0,the eye slots were too low.
2.0,"Runs real small, very cheaply made. if you want it for image id buy it but not to wear. caution"
2.0,Too large and baggy. Not sexy
2.0,"This was hard to get in the bioflex piece. and don't stay very flashy. definitely stays in place, and i dont have to worry about this popping out if it egetsgts caught behind my tooth, but other than that, just not very impressed for what ive spent"
2.0,"I ordered this shirt in 3 colors (white, Pink, Khaki) for my mom. When they arrived, only one (white) had the loops that hold up the sleeves. I returned the other two for replacements and noted the defect. They shipped the replacements promptly, but only the pink one had the loops this time. I just returned the khaki one for a refund. My mom does like the two shirts that were correct, but the quality control is lacking...especially since they sent a replacement with the exact same issue."
2.0,No cushion in the foot part
2.0,"Nice shirt, but it is NOT an extra large as stated in the description at the time I purchased it. It was intended to be worn by my husband for an ugly sweater party, but I ended up giving it to our 17-yr-old son who wears a medium in sweatshirts. It fit perfectly on our son."
2.0,Something inside the wallet stuck to the cards and the inside of wallet came out while trying to get cards out.
2.0,Liked the material but you MUST size up atleast 2 sizes..the top is more like a tube top
2.0,The raw edges and strap started fraying within a week which is OK if you want a distressed deconstructed look in the bag itself would hold up. And I’m still waiting for a refund on this and that is baffling to me as well they’ve gotten my bag returned and I’m yet to see my money I’m not sure I would trust them to order from them
2.0,"Nice color, but smaller than I thought"
2.0,I’m a little bummed that the shirt I received is washed out? Almost like there wasn’t enough ink? His helmet is white on the top and it seems like the darker colors didn’t take too well? And some of the x wings are barley visible
2.0,Bought the wallet in April and the strap broke by July. The stitching came out completely. I was careful not to overfill the wallet with coins or my phone. I do like the wallet because you can fit a passport in it easily. Just wish the wrist strap didn’t break.
2.0,"It had this extra fabric in the back that was confusing and unnecessary. I returned it, not for plus size."
2.0,It was too big in the arms and chest and too small in the waist.  The navy blue material made it look cheap.
2.0,Not what I expected.  Don't like how it opens
2.0,"El color es el mismo de la página, pero hay que pedir una talla mas, la tela es de buena calidad para clima frío"
2.0,"Loved the look and fit of bracelet; however, the 2 safety clasps had broken off within 10 days of purchase. I returned product."
2.0,"From the picture and the description I expected the beads to be clear (Crystal-like), but they are white (pearl like). It also took over a month to arrive and I only ordered one, but realizing they aren't sold in pairs. Who wants only one of these?? The picture is misleading, even though the description tells you to buy two for a pair. It's decent enough, but not what I wanted or expected."
2.0,"I'm typically a medium across the board for any brand, but this is too small. I'm  5'3"" and 135lbs with small waist and top heavy and have a booty. This suit is cute print but SMALL!"
2.0,"These glasses didn’t live up to my expectations. When purchasing I was looking for some mid quality-day drinking-party starting, glasses.  What I received was an o.k. Pair of glasses. If you have a male sized head these glasses might not fit perfectly on your nose resulting in a weird look with these glasses. Also the rainbow color just looks red"
2.0,Believed these to be real leather. These are synthetic
2.0,I’m unable to set the date & the time.
2.0,Not as great as expected wish the top was bigger like the picture showed....
2.0,This item came with the silver metal tarnished. I do not recommend it -
2.0,"bottom of the skirt flairs out, not like the picture where it keeps the pencil shape. disappointed"
2.0,"The print is fuzzy. Not so clear. And its a bit off center, so it is not so great."
2.0,I read in the reviews a few people saying these earrings irritated their ears. For 4 days of wear I was fine but day 5 my ear is sore and irritated. I won't be wearing these for more than a few hours if and when I do wear them. Disappointing because they are very pretty earrings.
2.0,"This purse is very cheaply made, and the strap just snapped after only having it for less than a month."
2.0,Although being a pretty large person the 1XL/2XL fit me way tooooooo big. Had to return.
2.0,The LED stopped working after the third day but I was able return the and seller refunded the money.  My daughter loved them but it was unfortunate that they were defective.
2.0,I ordered this but only got one.  Still very cute but kind of a let down.
2.0,Quality of material is good. I bought a large and I'm a 34 D small shirt 118lbs and I really could have used An XL to cover my clevage.
2.0,Ripped after wearing it very few times
2.0,"I was super excited when I saw this shirt on-line, but that quickly faded when I got it in. Let me first say, I love the feel and color/pattern. I was disappointed that it was so shear, yes I could fix that with a camisole, but then I noticed the button missing, so I knew it was going back. Also in the area that there was a button on the sleeve, it didn't look very nice, was kind of sloppy. I ordered a Medium (I mostly wear Medium sometimes a small), but this was more of a ""large medium"".  I think a small would have been to small. Disappointed."
2.0,Broke after 2 weeks at the zipper.
2.0,"Touch part of gloves too small to offer my hand position ability to type.  They do make my hands a little warmer, but that's it."
2.0,Was not moonstone
2.0,"The description says ""12 assorted colors"".  I got 4 colors,  3 of each.  Thinking of sending them back."
2.0,"I have never had an issue before with belly rings but this was way too large and actually covered the whole belly button and more, the sharp corners did not feel good stabbing me either."
2.0,"Either my ears are gigantic (they're not) or this thing is a lot smaller than it looks online. It in no way is large enough to reach the top of my ear to hook around it and it's so heavy when I put it on it just hangs down like a regular earing. Considering the cost I'm not upset by any means,  a little disappointed but I'm crafty enough to be able to do something to fix it or change it."
2.0,"I wrote my first review way to early. The 1st windy day, and not even more than a breeze, it broke."
2.0,I'm a medium or sometimes small in certain shirts. I bought a medium but it was very tight and the fabric was sheer. You can see your bra through it.
2.0,"flimsy, light weight, heart is cheap hollow plastic"
2.0,"Seems the size was not consistent with other North Face gloves, or my pair was faulty."
2.0,Material is not what was expected and didn’t come as appears in ad. Very voluminous.
2.0,I ordered these for our Polar plunge 80's workout theme and they were not the neon colors as shown. Very disappointed
2.0,Lense pops out of the frame- the frame is award looking - buy rimless I did
2.0,Grainy print quality but will still make a great gift for my boyfriend who loves Scream & Drew!
2.0,"I ordered the brown one,  color on this garish orange.  Rough knit."
2.0,For sure not for men. Maybe I was dumb to think a sock could be co-ed? I get to keep this pair and keep hunting for ones like this for him.
2.0,"Is not true size, it is uncomfortable compare to others. If you are going to buy it buy one size bigger"
2.0,Ordered a matching set for my daughter and I. While mine was pretty soft third green one was not it felt tough! The bottoms felt like gym shorts not feminine at all but I had cut the tag off mine thinking it would be fine. To my surprise when I initialed the return I only received $15 credit as opposed to the actual purchase price of 19.99! Don’t bother definitely worth trying in!
2.0,Loved the bracket but feel apart on the 1st day I wore it :(
2.0,"very nice construction and looks/materials, way too small to be a true XL"
2.0,"I ordered this in rose gold. The clasp it came with was rose gold, however the locket itself was not. There is a very obvious color distinction between the two. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Broken pieces, does not seem clean"
2.0,They sent me the wrong size in the one shorts. The other is the size I ordered. Other then that they feel light weight and feel good
2.0,It's not as sturdy as I thought it might be and the clasp is a little flimsy.
2.0,hmmm.  If you like bondage you'll love this leather hat
2.0,"The waist line wasn't quite long enough for me. I'm 5'3"", was about 125 lbs at the time I purchased this dress.  The material was a little thin, the length was just above my knees.  I returned this dress because, just wasn't suited for me."
2.0,"This tank is a crop top! Even paired with high waisted bottoms, it still does not cover the belly. Runs small as to the fit as well. It has pads and a shelf bra, which somewhat gave my poor girls a decent lift (34dd) without a bra, however you can see the pads through the top. Material is nice and color is very pretty."
2.0,"I was under the impression that this dress was made primarily from cotton and would be loose fitting with pockets.  The dress I received was primarily spandex reminding me of a bathing suit, and had no pockets.  It also arrived 2 months after I ordered it.  I went to see if I could return it, and it took so long to ship that the return window was closed. I would never wear this to teach in, which is why I bought it. I may wear it to bed as it is comfortable yet clingy.  Pretty disappointed. 🥺"
2.0,No matter how tight the ball is on it still comes off and I've swallowed two on accident.
2.0,very strange fitting
2.0,"I ordered the 16g but ended up getting a 14g in the mail. The style is nice, I'm just not interested in stretching at all."
2.0,"I thought this was adorable in the picture and assumed it was some kind of cotton blend. Boy was I wrong! The fit was fine, but it felt like plastic! I could never have worn this and not been embarrassed. I returned."
2.0,It's an awkward size and the faux leather didn't look as nice as I expected it to.
2.0,Very narrow shoes.
2.0,It broke where you tighten it
2.0,"The lease itself was absolutely beautiful. However, the arms are small in size, it looks awkward when you put it on, misshapen a bit."
2.0,When I received these gloves they smelled like they had been in someone’s basement or attic for a decade and the cuff on one of them was very soiled. They were also advertised as white and were actually a cream color:
2.0,"Nice hat, but somewhat big"
2.0,"The design of the sole is unsuccessful, too thin. All the bumps of the road are felt."
2.0,"I bought this product and wanted to like it. It's cute, and quiet, and the mopping feature worked great. Unfortunately, on arrival, the vacuum feature did not work, the robot would simply beep at me and not move. I had to contact the manufacture and ultimately return the item. I will be purchasing a roomba instead."
2.0,"Very cute, but it is TINY!<br />Very difficult to even tell what the figure is when worn."
2.0,I have purchased several bands like this in the past but something is different about this one. The color started coming off right away. I’m bummed.
2.0,"It's really cute, but the neck band doesn't lie flat. It flips outward because it's not cut at the right angle, so it looks kind of funny. The shoulders are also too tight, which is disappointing since it fits very loosely everywhere else and I wouldn't want to go up a size."
2.0,"Bought these for trip to Hawaii.  They did not fit any of out sunglasses (we have multiple different brands and styles, rayban, oakley, nike) and none fit.  The hole is just too small.  Missed returning them by 2 days :(  Guess we should have tried them before we left."
2.0,So cute but poorly made. Already falling apart in less than a month.
2.0,"This was super lightweight fabric and was very wrinkled when I received it. It didn't fit lie I expected, so I returned it."
2.0,Tarnished after a week
2.0,"I wore these for roughly 2 weeks. The fit was fine. The design and style looked as advertised. However, the quality of the stitching in the pair I purchased was very low. After about 2 weeks, the crotch seam ripped all the way from front to back making the pants unwearable."
2.0,Ok if your child is on the thin side the top is bigger then the true size
2.0,To small I sent them back
2.0,The printing on the shirt is not high quality and is just rubbing off after 2 wears.  This has not even been washed yet so I am sure it won't survive that.  I don't recommend these if you want something that lasts.
2.0,Too tight for me to feel comfortable.
2.0,"We started loving these, then about a week in the strap broke (@ the part that goes around the button the move the strap up or down). I can put it back on the button to make them look the same when the strap is up but the strap does nothing when it is down, just separates around the button where it tore."
2.0,turned color after only a few times of wearing it....
2.0,"Decent quality for the price.  Unfortunately the picture shows a silver chain and medallion, what I received was a gold/brass color.  Would not have ordered if I knew that."
2.0,"The body was perfect fit but the sleeves were too tight on forearms cutting off circulation. No stretching in that area. Warmth great, size good, color bright, material soft, zipper good quality. Only concern was the tightness of cuff on sleeve."
2.0,"Shipping is fast but, the only problem is the material. Is 100% polyester and not cotton. Do runs a little small. I order an XL and it fits like a M-L. But sinces is super stretchy and tight you might be lucky."
2.0,"Soft material, high quality but too long for me"
2.0,"Too small, China sizing."
2.0,"The seller reported that buyer could claim a “Free gift” with purchase, however did not provide an operational email address or link. I have tried to reach out to seller but no response"
2.0,"once I saw the product and the price I had to buy it. I bought this product on Jan 8th, then got it on the 23rd. I tried it on and it see-through (even with white undergarments) the straps on the top don't fit too. Looks can be deceiving."
2.0,"Just alright- the clasp broke after wearing it for about 3 months and it just feels kind of cheap. It looks okay, it doesn't necessarily look incredibly cheap but it doesn't look super expensive. All around it's just mediocre."
2.0,Not an evwning dress and goes to knees not as pictured
2.0,"This fits ok, a little short and I'm 5'4. It's super cheaply sewn, the back is just kinda crappy"
2.0,The “clasp”!!! OMG hard to fasten. Almost lost an earring one day. Afraid bend the latch to put in tiny “hole” because it is fragile.
2.0,Wasn't exactly as described but OK the only thing that was as discribed was the eye glass case
2.0,"The print on the onesie was off centered and sideways. Unfortunately, I had to return. It."
2.0,Pretty but definitely NOT a 3x.  It’s maybe a 10-12.
2.0,Very cheap. Not good at all.
2.0,Cheap product. Can not use in a heat press due to melting issues. Will not buy again.
2.0,"Found that it is difficult to tell back from front, maybe you can wear them either way.  No indication inside in regards to this or washing instructions.  Fleece on inside is not thick and therefore even though there is fleece inside, they are more like regular leggings than winter leggings.  The exterior is not soft and is a nylon material that can snag easily.  I bought a package with 3 pair.  So far, I have only worn two of the pair, they both fit differently in their cut.  They are certainly not what I expected.  Others have been very happy with them in their reviews and that is why I chose these.  Perhaps it is just my preference but I do not care for them."
2.0,The shirt arrived with dark stains on the back of it. I think it was dirt? I’m not sure. Hopefully it will come out in the wash but if not I would really appreciate receiving a clean one.
2.0,"I had the world's cutest bag for a whole two days. Then, the liner ripped and all of my things ended up floating around in the black hole that is created between a bag's liner and outer shell. I will not be purchasing a replacement because after looking at the liner, I'm pretty confident it would happen again if I were to get the same bag. Not great quality."
2.0,"I received the wrong color snowman, completely different than the picture."
2.0,"I expected it to run small but wow. And hand pockets are borderline useless, I tore through one on the first child morning. I'm going to try a larger size to see if it helps. If not it's still good outside of duty purposes."
2.0,they look good but are not any more waterproof than any other tennis shoe. As soon as I stepped in wet snow socks were soaked.
2.0,It's too small. I ordered a 2X but it fits too tight
2.0,Color wash is not at all what expected. If at all. And holes are cheaply cut into fabric. Fail.
2.0,Product is way too thin and will not protect anyone for and sneeze 🤧 or a couch material is spandex with no padding this shouldn’t be for sale
2.0,"I really like inexpensive fashion jewelry. I then have no need to worry about losing it or it going out of style (my niece will play with it.)<br />This just doesn't hang correctly. It's weaves with ribbons and is really quite pretty until you put it on then it just refuses to lay flat and flips up in the most warped way so you fidget, to no avail, with it all evening.<br />I've bought other necklaces from this company in the past and have been quite pleased, they make downscale but attractive statement pieces and this is the first I've been disappointed with.<br />The colors are quite pretty though but not recommend."
2.0,It's $49. What better way to say &#34;All your bases are belong to us.&#34;
2.0,Good material<br />Bad. Hot. Very tight I have a large head and neck
2.0,It was a cute shirt but a little to see through-ish for me. it was a bit skimpiest.
2.0,Have worn Russell products fir years. Wanted this to walk my miles this fall. Ordered a medium and fits ok. One big con is the top half of the zipper is hidden by side welting but bottom half of zipper is very exposed unlike the top half. Looks stupid! Don’t know why it looks ugly but it sure does. Not happy at all with this brand anymore!! Would not recommend this hoodie!!
2.0,Not happy about product. Size to small to even fir the average foot size.
2.0,"When I tried this on it fit me way too big, even though my size is medium. The shorts were way too baggy and the overalls were too long. I ordered a medium and it felt like a large."
2.0,this bag is almost great. but the inside material is not good - feels cheap and the handles feel cheap as well.  also felt a bit bulky.
2.0,"I've ordered a few of these dresses from Amazon, in different colors and I loved the others I received. I decided I wanted one in every color available. They were a soft, jersey material. The dark grey from the same company is my absolute fave! Very flattering. The most recent that I received (burgundy) was such a disappointment. This is a terrible material! It's not soft or forgiving. It doesn't breath and that's just unacceptable for a Texas summer. The arm holes are also a little tight. I have average sized arms. I workout, but I'm also a thirty-something with the typical mom-shake in my arms. I would return this dress if it wasn't such a hassle. I planned on ordering even more, but now I'm unsure of what kind of quality I will receive."
2.0,"See through material, love the print and style but not a size 10 as described. I am 5’8” and about 160 pounds. Had my 14 year old daughter try them on and she is 120 pounds and 5’7”, they fit her waist better but still too snug to be comfortable."
2.0,"Holy smokes - I’m an XL, 5’10”, 220 lbs.  this shirt fits my gf.  She’s 5’4” and weighs 140"
2.0,"Wasn't impressed with this dress. The white part of the dress was dirty, and it was a bit stretched out, like someone wore it and then returned it."
2.0,This watch is so complicated to figure out. Will be returning.
2.0,I ordered these a size up from what my toddler was currently in and they are so small i couldnt even get her heel in the boot. I ordered a size 6 and she is  size 5 in every other shoe. I wanted to account for all the extra padding but they fit more like a 3-4. they are very well make shoes. i am loyal to the brand when it comes to winter boots but i am going to have to pass these along to my 6 month old niece.
2.0,Not as pictured fabric not the same too short and not float. More like a summer maxi and not prom like
2.0,All five of the elastic bands were connected at the top and bottom.  I pulled one to separate and it unraveled.
2.0,The lining is longer than the dress when I tried it on. I really loved the dress though!
2.0,Glue was stuck to wallet..stitching gathered on one side
2.0,"The mask is PINK. Looks like a cream color in the pic, but it is a very pink base."
2.0,big under arms
2.0,It a nice bangle but too small more for a teenager!
2.0,"It's ok, not crazy about the brim ,a little big and stick out too far. The studs I like ,kinda stylish and can be cute with large hoop earrings . Something different if you dare to wear it and I think I will"
2.0,Some of these are ridiculously short! Best for younger teens.
2.0,"ok, very thin and extremely flammable! I'd be very careful cooking in this, or having a cigarette, I was accidentally bumped with someones cigarette and it burned a hugh hole in the sleeve so fast it was scary!"
2.0,"The purposely off center middle hem is just silly. One picture had a belt, and since I needed this dress for a wedding I tried a belt. That did not work. I looked super frumpy!! It could be cute if that middle hem actually lined up and you didn’t have to cover it with a belt to make it look nice. Otherwise it definitely looks like you forgot how to button and people will just spend time staring at you trying to figure out where the missed button is. (That’s what my husband did) thankful I found a better dress option amd returned this one."
2.0,"Color is nice and material is soft, but it didn't fit right. Was snug in the chest and the neck was too high.  The neckline in general just looked funny. It looks like it should of had some ruching at the neck, but it was pretty flat and looked like it wasn't constructed well. I ended up returning it."
2.0,Fits as expected except way too big in the waist and length die to no hem at bottom. Very thin material.
2.0,"I was hoping there would be some kind of dimension given for this pendant? Turns out 55 carats is a little LARGE for my body size (it's about an inch in length). I was disappointed that the petals surrounding the amethyst are NOT antiqued. Nope. They are shiny as a new nickel. That makes it look kind of cheap. Thing is, I have a smaller version of this IDENTICAL flower that does have the antiqued petals. I made earrings with them, so this could've been the perfect set, but now it simply does not match at all, unless I can figure out a way to make the surrounding petals antique black."
2.0,"the image and colors are incorrect, the pair that arrived were grey, black, and white only...not navy with coral. I gave as a gift."
2.0,"Can't use them at all.  Since other people were stating that it runs small, I ordered the 2X and it STILL wasn't big enough"
2.0,"I’m 5’4, 120 lbs, 32C. Ordered a small, fit great EXCEPT the chest area was HUGE!!! Don’t buy if you’re on the small chested side of things. Otherwise nice material and cute colors."
2.0,dress was stiff and too tight on top
2.0,This sweater fit nothing like the picture. It wasn’t too small. It just wasn’t oversized and slouchy like the picture shows. I returned it.
2.0,This top was definitely not like the one pictured. I ordered a XL and the shirt was too small in the shoulders and sleeves. It fit irregular and it was uncomfortable.
2.0,Pretty generic/cheap looking
2.0,This dress is thin. Super thin. So thin you can see through it no matter what you wear underneath. It's a shame because the cut is cute.
2.0,"1. These are nothing even close to the colors in the picture.  The yellow and pink are seriously neon.  I know that colors vary from one screen to the next, but this seems like more than that.  The middle color is a really good purple, which I like, but isn't the same as the blue-ish purple shown.<br /><br />2. I got the medium.  The width on them is good for compression, but these are a good three inches longer than all the other compression sleeves I have.  Idk who's tibia is that long!  I'm 5'6&#34;, so maybe these are meant for someone WAY taller.<br /><br />3. The compression seems about the same as others I have with this compression rating.  Yay for that!  :D<br /><br />Hope you find this helpful."
2.0,"I just recently bought some really dope Low Air Jordan 1’s (Size 13) and I bought the largest they had for this product. Though it did fight nicely and wasn’t uncomfortable at all, they did not prevent creasing like they said they would. You can see on the attached photos that my shoe leather was flexing a bit, even when I barely even lifted my heal of the ground. The plastic is quite flimsy and for people who walk a bit rough and bend there toes a lot they will likely crease their shoes. I’m not a monster and wouldn’t even dare to demonstrate the inability to prevent creases on these shoes, just take my word for it."
2.0,"It doesn't look as nice as it does in the picture. The plaid accents are more of a royal blue than the dark blue depicted in the photo. Also, the sizing of the shirt is very small; you may have to go up two sizes in order to fit this shirt."
2.0,"The product looks exactly like the picture, but is not very comfortable and the blue beads stain your skin/rub off color on you."
2.0,I used one week and the big one whit the cross broken one line nonis really good I m loved and liked but one is broken
2.0,It ripped after 5 days. I gave it to homeless lady for her kids
2.0,I like the outfit but it's too small an I don't the quality of the fabric
2.0,Not very tinted. Went flimsy quickly. Not a good buy. Bummed i spent so much $$ on them
2.0,"I will be returning this item because it was see through in the butt area and a bit too large throughout, but other than that it was a pretty dress, just wasn't for me."
2.0,"I’m a nurse and bought these because I am on my feet all day. They were so extremely tight that it was painful. Had to take them off and left having to wear my shoes with no socks all day. I bought based on correct sizing. Way, way, to expensive. Won’t ever buy again"
2.0,Horrible fabric. I use it to go grocery shopping only.
2.0,"This was fun and people enjoyed seeing it.  It is hard on your cards with the plastic slots and will wear the numbers off.  The rubberized material can be hard to get into and out of your pockets.  It is well made though, and pretty neat aside from the few faults."
2.0,I bought these for my granddaughter to wear but due to their sizing issue she will not be able to wear them for a good year!  I've attached a picture of a true size 9 shoe just to show how much they are off. I did keep the shoes though as she will eventually grow into them and they are cute.
2.0,"Bought these for my first ski trip, they lasted 3 days before the crotch blew out. They fit well but aren’t very flexible and the wind cuts right through them. Wish I would have spent the extra money on better pants..."
2.0,"It's great reflective, but won't stay on. I tried 3mm tape just tore off the inside lining on the band."
2.0,It’s very sheer and doesn’t have any support. It feels cheap. Does have a good stretch. But I don’t see any use for it.
2.0,The chain fell off after 2 days...
2.0,My girlfriend got this to wear to a concert this pas weekend and it broke half way through the day and turned her neck green. It is very cheaply made.
2.0,"I received these shoes today.  I tried them on and they are not what I expected.  Very cheaply made.  The left heel has a lean to it and it's fresh out of the box. I will not purchase from this seller again, if this is how they do business."
2.0,They are very large. Not a regular sized pair of glasses. And there’s a sticker on the case which leaves paper on the case when you pull it off.
2.0,The long wait wasn't a big deal because I ordered them early.  I wanted to like these.  I just came back and realized the ones I received don't even have a bow. I had forgotten.<br /><br />I should have checked them more closely before putting them away. I would have returned them.  They were much larger than I expected and the top of the front of the shoe was cut very jagged.  The raw edge rubs against to top of her foot.
2.0,"First, these are GREAT tube scarves. They keep me warm, or cool, depending on the weather. They wick sweat away from my neck, head, or face. They stretch to fit, and stay in place as I exercise, hike, or what ever. After one wash they're still GREAT, and the edges seem to have flattened out.<br /><br />My main complaint is that I did not receive the colors I ordered. Instead of receiving four different colors, I received all GREEN. Luckily I like green. It's not really worth the trouble sending them back, so, before ordering, make sure you will be happy with what ever color you receive. :)"
2.0,"You get what u pay for, dress went loose at the seams after one wear. Had to get it reinforced."
2.0,"I bought this in mid December for my fiancé for Christmas. He has only had it a month, and it already isn't holding a charge :( this is disappointing for him and myself. Neat concept. But poor quality. Tried to contact seller, but can't figure out how now that it's 4 days outside of the return period."
2.0,"I wanted to LOVE this dress. I love everything about the design but when it arrived, the pleats made it WAY too poofy for my figure.  Other than that, I would have worn it to work the very  next day. I plan to buy another dress from Miusol in the same style without the pleats and I am hopeful that it will be just right. I will def. be checking this seller in the future for cute work clothes."
2.0,Cute dress but the zipper is diffiuclt to zip up and the fabric above the zipper tore after only a few uses.
2.0,"I ordered the biggest size which was still about 2 sizes too small, the bottoms fit with a little bit of a struggle but still rolled up and the top didn't even go on. 2xl fit like a large. It took 3 weeks to be delivered"
2.0,I would not recommend this top. It runs small and this color is too sheer.
2.0,The band length was good the cup was wonky it was not flattering and gave my breast a weird shape. It wasn’t that comfortable after a couple hours. The material felt nice and it was a decent quality just not comfy or flattering.
2.0,Cute swimsuit but comes in Asian sizes I ordered a large and the top fits perfect through bottom is made for a child
2.0,Looks like a prisoner.
2.0,"I bought these sunglasses because i was looking for a good pair to wear around. i worn them three times already and they some how got a crack down the middle of them. its small enough not to notice but i really liked the sunglasses. I would recommend them for sure they are great sunglasses, i mean im going to continue to wear them until they fall completely apart."
2.0,The stitching was really off and the hem was wavy not strait at all. The material also wrinkled wayyy too easily. It just seemed way too cheaply made for how much I paid.
2.0,Ended up returning them.  The quality was subpar and they were on the smaller side.  There are better options out there.
2.0,"Ordered a large (I'm a medium) and they fit like leggings not sweats. The tie string was extended by a smaller strip attached to a longer one, and was hanging by a thread, literally. I had to sew it together to even wear them. They are cute, but if you don't want them really tight order bigger than what you usually wear."
2.0,The writing was to small to actually read.
2.0,Logo is much larger. It's a full front chest. Tight fit even going a size up.
2.0,Very thin . Cheap.
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for my mother for Christmas. She wore it, just as it came, the day it arrived. To her dismay, the bezel that was on it fell off and was lost. She didn't notice any type of lock to keep them on after she played around with other bezels after."
2.0,I wouldn’t consider this a church dress
2.0,"It's a pretty cool looking band, but after about 1 month of owning it both of the side straps broke off.  It appears that they were pretty much just tucked into some string and that was about all that was holding them onto the main strap.<br /> Giving it 2 stars since it still functions, just looks significantly less awesome.  Beware."
2.0,Seemed to stretch out as the kids used them. Ended falling off my grandson
2.0,"I didn't expect such flat glasses. These are practically straight across, no curvature. This makes for an uncomfortable fit and tons of light leaking in around the sides. If it's the look you're going for, fine. For me, it made them uncomfortable enough I gave them to my kids to play with immediately. The cost to return them was enough to make it not worth the effort."
2.0,"I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of these headbands.  After a couple of uses, the flowers came off the headband.  I had to re-glue the flowers to the elastic headband.  I wish they would have adhered them to the band a little better so I could have gotten more use out of them."
2.0,Letters missing chunks of the letter.  Fits small and I even ordered a size larger just Incase.
2.0,I ordered 2 sizes and each of them were big and stretched out looking in the arm pits
2.0,"this pant hugs in all the wrong places, the pattern is cute but it's not flattering"
2.0,The blue in the photo must be enhanced digitally because this is a clear pendant with some blue glitter painted on the back. It's very deep/round and from almost every angle looks clear except head-on.
2.0,The shirt material is very thin and the floral pattern shown in the image is NOT what you are getting.  The front of my shirt is almost all black while the back is beautiful with the flowers all over!!!  I asked to return but no response from vendor. DO NOT ORDER unless you just want a cheaper throw on shirt.  Again it is thin and clingy so order up a size.
2.0,"Actually, the bag is ok, just two complains:<br />1) It is too small (I am 6'2'')<br />2) It doesn't seem as waterproof as it says. I wouldn't take the risk to take it outside in the rain."
2.0,Look exactly like the picture but a bit more shiny so it makes you appear as if you have some pimp sunglasses on. They are not is not quite my style.
2.0,"The neck line is made out of a small woven string.  That string holds the shoulder pieces together.  it looks a bit cheap from that perspective, but i like the material."
2.0,Love this dress!! The V neck is not straight in the middle center of this dress. I will try another same size and return this. Otherwise I would give it a 10! Size med. Black
2.0,"I am 5’3” and 125 pounds and the large fit just right.  Unfortunately, the fabric and buttons were not the quality that I was expecting so I did return it."
2.0,there is no TOMMY BAHAMA LOGO on these any where as it said in the ad that it had their palm tree or something...they have nothing. What you see is what you get
2.0,"I tried specifically to set the color choice to gray - going back in my order be sure it was gray.  It wasn't, even though I had specified that, so I changed it to gray.  I saw  no place on the final order summary to check what color was being sent.  When I got it, the skirt was blue.  So now I have it to send back at my own expense.  I may order it a bit smaller as I feel it is a little large, even though, if anything, I may have ordered it a bit smaller than my measurements - I don't remember.  The skirt is lovely, but I am very busy to be having to send it back and don't want to be paying  postage.  I do not know how to rate it as I have not tried washing it, etc.  But it looks lovely, as I had hoped."
2.0,The metal clips are rough and it hurts your skin.<br />For the price expected a better product.
2.0,Cheap watch you get what u pay for  Strap is cheap dosent close propery
2.0,it will make you look bigger
2.0,This is not the real thing as far as I can tell - cheaply made and had a piece of metal swarf stuck in the face of the dial.  Disappointed.
2.0,"Not sure how this set got such great reviews. The material is really crummy, like 90s polyester....kind of afraid they will spark and catch fire if worn! They are inexpensive but aren't worth the price at all....I've gotten softer legging pajama sets at the dollar store on random visits for $10 also. Gave a 2 since they arrived on time and was the color I ordered. Wouldn't recommend this set or order again."
2.0,The material is cheap quality and feels like a Chinese knock-off.
2.0,It runs very small. A 7-8 yr size fit like a size 5-6.<br /><br />Also one strap broke during first use. Probably due to improper size.  Didn't notice until gymnastics class so didn't have any alternative at the  time which was annoying.<br /><br />I gave  it two stars due to design. o
2.0,Size didnot fit. It two size larger :(
2.0,This band would not slide into my watch.
2.0,"I wanted to love these - they were cute and the material was nice and light. However they ran very small. The 20-22 seemed more like an 18. If it were marked as a 20 and was an 18, that would still be too small, but maybe a bit more forgivable in being close. But that it was supposed to fit a 22 was laughable. It's also 100 percent cotton, so you can probably count on shrinking too. So unfortunately I had to send these back."
2.0,"Bought as a gift for my mom, said it didn’t fit right, runs small"
2.0,I really wanted to like this dress. The fabric was comfortable and it fit nicely.  Unfortunately the construction is poor and there are puckers on the seams. The bust also has fabric on the inside that shows through.
2.0,I received this today without the tool and spring pins. Very disappointed! I would love it if you could send these to me so I can use this! Thank you!
2.0,Stitching coming loose after only few wears. Not thrilled after spending $$ on this. Was expecting better build quality.
2.0,Shirt came faded as if someone had worn it. Bad business practice to have such a vibrant picture & give a dull & muted product. Would not buy again.
2.0,Not impressed with fit. I only use it when I am mowing the lawn and almost won't wear it for that.
2.0,"This wasn't flattering on me, and I didn't care for the middle sash part. Ended up not keeping went with something else"
2.0,"Could not fit it, not for a thick woman at all."
2.0,"I wish Lands End knew how to fit a woman's body. These are LOOSE at the hips and thighs and TIGHT at the knees. Very WEIRD and UNFLATTERING,"
2.0,Cute but small. Size 2x is like a size 12 US.
2.0,"Cute sun hat, but lined with flannel material which will be to hot in the sun.  I didn't not realize in description it was flannel .I would not recommend."
2.0,"Super Dark, not as advertised.<br />As a member of the church, I expected better.<br />I believe in the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. FYI : I AM A 65YO ADULT, not a kid, who likes to exaggerate."
2.0,They are nice but not cashmere! Feel more on wool blend but not enough to send back. I am allergic to all wool.  I would recommend but not as cashmere.
2.0,An XL should have huge on me.  I love oversized pjs.  These barely got over my butt!  U less you’re super tiny…these won’t fit you.  Order 2 sizes up if you’re going to order.
2.0,"After a short period of time, a seam came apart. Stitching on the front pocket is coming loose"
2.0,Not great . The back looks very bad . I wish I did not buy it
2.0,Sleeves are an odd length.  Material  is see through.
2.0,"The waist was way too high and the slit felt awkward as in I felt pretty bare, didn’t drape the way I expected."
2.0,"Way, way too small and I ordered up a size.  Cute dress.  Nice material."
2.0,Product came in on time but the bag it came in had a slit that cut through the purse as well. It is pretty noticeable and hard to hide.
2.0,Colour not as pretty in person
2.0,"I love the dress, but there is a flaw in the front of the gown.  Some of the glitter looks like it was scratched off.  I'm hoping to salvage it with spray on glitter."
2.0,"These socks are not worth the very high price. My 9 month old was able to pull it off. That was the number one reason I bought these. Also, they pulled after one wash and the elastic started to come out. I have them two stars because baby kept them on longer than any other socks, but she was still able to get them off... not worth the money!"
2.0,It just didn’t lay right on my body. The fabric is weird.
2.0,Bought the right size but these are almost like wearing  a compression sock around your breasts and abdomen.  Couldn't even get it on.
2.0,"I am not very impressed with this shirt.  I ordered according to the size chart and since it said a small was 39 inch chest.  Well it is not anywhere close to that size.  It’s more like a 36, which is way too small.  The stitching is bad with strings hanging off the collar and elsewhere.  I also found the fabric to be kinda rough."
2.0,The colors aren’t as vibrant as the pictures. They fit very snug! My feet slide out of them and I ordered the correct size. I wanted to like them but I’ll just give them away since they’re pretty much useless to me
2.0,"These were really cute earrings.  The only problem is that, the second time I wore them, the little piece of wood where that attaches to the metal backing broke.  It just disintegrated and, because of the way the earring is constructed, there's no way to re-attach it.  I was in the middle of teaching a class when this happened, so it's not like the earring were under any undue stress.<br />TL; DR: cute earrings but broke my second time wearing them"
2.0,Love the band stainless steel like real stuffs from Apple. I recommended to anyone. They are also my first time buyer those bands from Amazon.. I will definitely buy again.. This silver n rose gold I haven’t tried yet but I worn multi colors now..
2.0,"The style is nice, the size was okay. I really liked the sleeves. I ordered a large and it was a little small. I'm returning because the fabric is unpleasant to the touch. Very scratchy. Might be okay with a cami underneath but I would need an extra large to make that work."
2.0,"This was for a gift, she loved it, however the large jewel ended up falling off within a week."
2.0,The hat itself is a ordinary hat decent quality but the Uber graphic is thin and flimsy and looks like it will come start coming off after a wash or two. I really expected better quality for the price.
2.0,"the sizing it advertises is the size of the package it comes in, NOT the actual gummi bear. the bear is about 1.5x0.5x0.25.... i was going to send it back becasue of this,  but just ended up gifting it to my nephew... but really disappointed."
2.0,"Runs small on me, I'm 5'5 and it's too short.  I ordered a medium."
2.0,The product is BEAUTIFUL but the description and sizing is trash. Order about 6 sizes up
2.0,I ordered this specifically because my children are fans of pat and jen. I got a jen key chain and herobrine but instead of a pat key chain i got 2 dantdm keychains.
2.0,The fit didn't fit As the picture appears!  Not very happy with it.
2.0,"I love Danner boots,but these insoles are too hard for me. Had to put Timberland's in my Danners."
2.0,It was very pretty but the turtle was very small and the note was literally just a piece of paper. It came in a small plastic baggie.
2.0,Bought this dress for a wedding. When it arrived it spelt odd and fabric was missing at the end of the lace ended up having to get it fixed and got some money back. The boning on the ribs were bent and uncomfortable.  And fit super lose in the shoulder.
2.0,"with the post, luckily though, I managed to bend it back just enough to make it fit at least halfway decent. Kind of looks like it was painted gold with a dry brush."
2.0,"My daughter really wanted this backpack for her first year of middle school. when it came in she was in love with the image. Unfortunately, after a month of use, one of the straps ripped out from the bottom and was starting to rip at the top. Very disappointed."
2.0,Purchased for my wife she has this saying garment same company same design same size but the one I received is quite a bit larger
2.0,Pretty but leather band broke the first few weeks I had it.
2.0,"granted I am hard on my watches, I've never had a band break so fast, or break period. I usually break the pins, but when I broke the pin on this band it also tore the band its self. wont buy again"
2.0,"Outside is nice...inside is not as described, has brown color ""fur"" added in. Size runs small, order up 2 sizes if you want some room to move in it."
2.0,Nice bracelet but smaller than stated
2.0,Didn’t light up! That the reason I bought it!!
2.0,Must be a made overseas product because its cut too small... I wear an XL USA and would have to order a 2X to fit correctly. I missed the deadline to return.
2.0,They didn't send the ones in the pictures. Recieved the heart and a video game one when panda and hearts were ordered.
2.0,"Super tiny, does not fit around my head or my girlfriends head that I bought it for"
2.0,This is super comfortable but extremely see through. I use it as a bathing suit cover but originally purchased for casual family pics didn’t wear it..
2.0,The shirt was too snug and was not as described. It is not flattering or loose as mentioned.
2.0,"Beware this top runs very very slim and small for its size.  I purchased this top to wear around the house, and to exercise in. Some  Athletic ware runs a little smaller in size so I ordered an extra large size and it’s still too small. This shirt is really cut for somebody who is very petite  and has more of a straight figure.<br /><br />Otherwise I thought the material was good quality the color was true to what it showed on the Internet, but I thought the description online was not accurate, and should have explained that this top was designed for a very specific figure type.<br /><br />Disappointed."
2.0,The sizing is more of a child's size then an adults I usually wear a XL I ordered a XXL and couldn't even get it on over my shoulders. it was pretty but the sizing is ridiculously off!
2.0,"This skirt is of great quality, although the belt is just for decorative purposes as it's tiny and rather flimsy. I went 2 sizes up from medium but it was still very small. I'm 145lbs and 5'7&#34;. I'm thinking I should have gone 4 sizes up which I still can't wrap my mind around. I gave it to a 12 year old child and it did fit her and she is average size."
2.0,"Fits nice and loosely, neckline is cute BUT absolutely shapeless. It's a box cut dress with sleeves and a loose collar. I wear a vest at work and looks cute with it but without the vest my grandma would be happy with wearing this dress."
2.0,The ring holder  attached to the watch and clip came off . I almost lost my watch .  It needs to be bent to put it back on so it will stay .
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this jumpsuit, but it looks nothing like the tie dye design shown. It resembles more paint spots rather than tie dye. The fit is nice, but not enough to look like a spotted cow =D"
2.0,"Way too small! Ordered an XL, I wear a MED, still too small. Also, its poorly made...material, stitching...very misleading!"
2.0,Too tight. No stretch at all.  She will not wear it.
2.0,little to no flash - VERY dull. Just polished stones and no shape to them like the photo & don't recommend since you dont' know what you're getting. Will not order again.
2.0,Product was as described and delivery was as promised. When I opened up the packaging to the t-shirt the T-shirt smelt like a Chinese restaurant. Had to wash the t-shirt before gifting to my grandson. The t-shirt smelled horrible.
2.0,"Bought these moccasins one month ago, have only worn them around the house, and the soul is already tearing away from the side on one of the shoes. Poor quality! Won't buy again!"
2.0,Dress was super thin and no shape to it. Very unflattering. Sent it back.
2.0,"i like the idea of reusable totes/bags for shopping, easy to keep clean and compact when folded. Box was Strong for what I filled it with. the major down side was the handles broke away at the top fastener/rivet.Im 2 out of 6 with broken handles. Now the 2 damaged are use as a storage box. If the handles were of better material and had better stitching they would last more than 4 uses."
2.0,The glasses started to peel and crack after one day of use. Save your money and buy a pair a bit more expensive that isn't generic.
2.0,A lot smaller than I expexted
2.0,"Okay, so. Out of the bag the dress looks okay. But 0% like expected. It's literally just an oversized bag-dress of dyed-red cotton blend fabric. I don't hate it, but expectation vs. reality is night and day. Don't expect the dress to look like the same style as the picture and you're good. I don't know what else to say. Will it do the job that I need it to? Sure. Does it look at all like the slouchy dress it is advertised as? No. Length is okay. I'm 5'11"" and the length is just okay. If you're expecting true maxi like a short girl gets on the daily, look elsewhere. Don't know where. But there are better dresses. It IS comfortable. Like a nightgown. But yeah."
2.0,Disappointed in the model looked like it for well oversized which i liked but when I got it it for all different small
2.0,"As others have said, the zipper is on the left like a female item. Product pictures include colored trim on the front pockets but the item I received was actually solid black. It is listed as a “Lightweight” but is actually lined and thicker than the average sweatshirt. That’s 3 unwelcome surprises in one little box. If you want a plain, female, thick sweatshirt, this is your item."
2.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing and most of them say the shirt is oversized, that’s what I wanted so I bought it! I normally wear a large but I sized up to an XL to really be sure it would be oversized. Well the shirt fits perfectly, and only goes down to the top of my jeans so it’s almost cropped even. Hopefully I can return because it is not at all what I expected."
2.0,"Within an hour of wearing them, I had to exchanged them and wear my old boots; they caused me blisters on the back of my feet. The inside has no padding, not comfortable. Too much money to used them for only 1 hr and now have them sitting in my locker taking up space!"
2.0,Right fits &#34;OK&#34;. Left was made incorrectly - thong was attached to the sole incorrectly. Left is very loose fitting. Will only wear these Flip Flops as shower shoes. Will not buy this product again from this seller.
2.0,Well i ordered pink....so imagine my surprise when I see a cream color. I’m fair completed with light blond hair.... not usually a good choice color for me. Aside from that... the front is ripped. It’s also very sheer. I’m thinking this may be a beach cover rather than public use. Not worth the hassle to try to return.
2.0,Fit was okay except very tight in the arms. Thus resulted from the sleeves being sewn on incorrectly.  It shrunk after the 1st washing in cold water on gentle cycle. Dried laying flat.  Could not wear it a 2nd time.
2.0,These start to fall apart pretty quick. They are pretty when they first come and fit as stated.
2.0,"I wear a size 8 shoe typically. I got the large size 8-9 and these are MASSIVELY HUGE. They're a good inch too long for me and they're really wide on my already wide foot. My husband who wears a size 10 in men's shoes can comfortably wear these. That being said, they do seem to be really comfortable. The faux fur lining is really soft and thick and they are warm. I'm a little disappointed these will have to be sent back."
2.0,"NICE LOOKING, WELL MADE AND ROOMEY.  BUT SHOULDER STRAP HOOKS ON CROOKED SO YOU CANNOT CARRY ON SHOULDER."
2.0,"Not impressed , looks like halloween costume material"
2.0,I didn't like the material of this dress and it was too small/tight
2.0,WAS ALL BENT
2.0,I’m usually a Medium or a large im 5’1 and the e X-Large is snug
2.0,Very cheap vinyl that was stuck together and peeled off when separated. Weird circles too
2.0,"I am 5'7"" 140lbs and typically when something is described as ""oversize or flowy"" I wear a Medium.  So I ordered a Medium. The dress is short, mid-calf at best.  It was not flowy or oversized as pictured, I struggled to achieve the off-shoulder look here.  The stripes are definitely horizontal, as opposed to slightly diagonal as pictured.  The material is similar to a jersey material, it's thick and not very breathable.  I returned the dress, as it wasn't what I was hoping for."
2.0,On looks alone - these are five star.  BUT they are incredibly heavy.  They’re like beautiful little briicks hanging from your ears.
2.0,"The shield on this hat was shipped folded and not rolled up so there is crease in it that won’t come out. The hat I ordered was supposed to have a zipper for the shield, this one has velcro. It’s not great, but I can use it"
2.0,"I got these slippers for my son to wear during pajama day at his preschool.  My son is 4 years old and wears shoes size 10.5 so I thought these slippers in size 11 would do, but when we got them they were small and my son's heels hung out of them.  And as soon as he tried them on, first thing he said was, ""these are not comfy"".  The soles are very thin; the padding is pretty much non existent.  Wish I got different slippers.  I posted a picture to show how thin the soles are."
2.0,"Poorly made,  but expected fir the price and amount.  Color removes very quickly and turns copper color."
2.0,The fabric was not very good quality.
2.0,"Padding is in the wrong place. Not enough in the crotch, too much on the back of the butt. These run small. I usually wear a large, would have to wear an XL in these."
2.0,"This is really large, not meant for small wrists"
2.0,I was very excited about these shoes but the size was very large.  I am not sure I will be able to use them once my son can fit in them due to the weather.
2.0,"The lighted barrette part of this is really bright and holds pretty well in hair, but is kinda chunky.  The filaments are sparse and barely glow, so would hardly be visible except that they are so stiff, they stick out from the head rather than lie against the hair.  If I weave them in to my hair to hold them down at ALL, they completely disappear.  Guess I'll try to attach my own filament to beef it up.  Would be worth a couple dollars, but not the $7 it cost with shipping. On the positive side, this arrived in TWO DAYS, so I WOULD use CashCo1000 again."
2.0,Wouldn’t stay closed
2.0,"I usually wear a size medium, so I brought a large (wanted my sweater to be bigger), however the large fits like a medium size :("
2.0,"Nice and bright, but hologram part did fell off 2 days later."
2.0,"These fit fine and worked for a costume. I bought them hoping they'd serve a double purpose and be good winter boots, however, they aren't waterproof like the listing claims. My children mucked in puddles on Halloween and came home with wet feet."
2.0,"Although the color in the photo is a nice, lively lime green, the scarf is actually quite fluorescent in color. It is more of a shawl since it is 44&#34; wide, and it has a nice, gauzy texture.  The scarf was delivered in a small carrying bag and emerged quite wrinkled, but perhaps that is part of its look.  My rating of two stars is based on the unexpected brightness of color, which will make it difficult to wear as intended.  If you are looking for a really bright scarf, this might be for you!"
2.0,"They're super cute... But the gem post doesn't have any notches to secure it to the base post. So once I got it in my nose, the gem would fall off."
2.0,"I read the reviews and most people said it fit as expected.  Since a few people said it fit small I decided to buy a size bigger. I normally wear a size 16 so I got a 2X thinking that is normally an 18/20. This wasn't even close! This might fit a size 12. It is a great material...very soft and a little stretchy.  It's a little shorter than I expected,  but that was ok. It's too bad I  can't get a bigger size."
2.0,Let me just say this watch band is beautiful for the price. Looks high end and really makes the watch stand out.<br /><br />Heres one problem... The clipping mechanism for this band isnt good. I put it on one morning..heard the click sound meaning it was locked in. Walked out my door and about half a block in... My watch falls out of my wrist and hits the ground face first. I knew instantly my screen was gone. Just received it back from MOTO after paying $110.<br /><br />Its a great looking band but I will not trust it on a $300 watch.... This band ended up costing me a fortune.
2.0,En la fotos se ven de mayor calidad
2.0,Why did these earrings come with a cheap rubber backing? The photo shows it's supposed to be a classic silver backing. Highly disappointed with that.
2.0,"Day 1 - A rhinestone fell off and jiggling around inside the face<br />Day 2 - Literally cannot get the buckle free! It was completely stuck, tried with several friends to get it off. Couldn't figure it out for a long time. Had to break it to get it off.<br /><br />It was cute while it barely lasted."
2.0,Love the color. The connectors fall off my watch so I had to use originals that came with watch. It doesn't hold up very well but so pretty
2.0,Not narrow enough in the hips.
2.0,Cheap material and too big. I ordered a medium and I wish I sized down
2.0,Not at all like image. Pants are more like capris. Way too small.
2.0,Very thin and weird material…kinda like a garbage bag🤦🏻‍♀️
2.0,Eh. Maybe it’s just me but I don’t really find they do much of anything.
2.0,"Glasses showed up on time, good packaging but they are the same as ones in the picture. In picture it shows them having little rubber pieces on the ends where they rest above your ears. Mine did not come with. Made of cheap flimsy plastic, we'll see how long they last"
2.0,I wish Amazon would stop buying so much for China. Their sizes are so much smaller than U.S.<br />Very cute & beautiful color....but have to return as usual.
2.0,"I was truly so excited to get these leggings, they are outrageously expensive in a boutique.  The sizing is WAYYYY off, extremely small.  I got the largest size (I'm a size 10/US) and my sister tried them on (size 6/US) and they were uncomfortably tight on her. Very disappointed!"
2.0,This dress is not high quality. The button on the back wasn’t even sewn on. The liner was so short it didn’t even come past my butt and I was so afraid all night my butt would show. I ordered a large just in case. I’m glad I did. I usually wear a medium. It was ok. Wasn’t spectacular but wasn’t awful either.
2.0,First off I did that like that the dress color did not match the description this dress is pink it is not quite the fit is excellent however the bodice on the front of this dress is not right there is something wrong with the chest area that makes your chest look weird
2.0,"If I had tried this on before purchase, I probably would not have bought it. I find the center hole to be large, meaning it sits rather low on my head. I think I will add some additional velcro to be able to adjust it further. It also holds its shape from being curled, which I don't like."
2.0,I hated these!!! They were okay until I realized the no seam on the booty is like the least flattering thing ever. I wanted to like them....but that was a total fail.
2.0,Cute shirt with vibrant colors. The cut was an hour glass shape and it runs small. The fabric was a cotton blend but it was thicker than I expected and would not do well in hot summer days. I had to return it.
2.0,Belt is listed as 1.5&#34; but the belt clips are bigger than that so it doesn't fit a single belt loop on either jeans or any brand BDU i have.  Thanks for wasting my money.
2.0,Color is pretty and material is fine. But it runs really big and it isnt flattering. I ordered a large.
2.0,Really bummed that you have to have a battery pack separate to purchase. I thought it came with everything to use right away but you have to buy a completely separate battery pack to even use it. Definitely a bummer.
2.0,I bought thus same brand and style in black and this fits completely different. The one I ordered was dark green in an XXL. I wear a size 12 US. Thus dress was so right you could see through it. The black on i ordered month ago fit like a dream. I'm very disappointed as I wanted more colors of this dress.
2.0,"Loved this belt at first -- until belt buckle snapped off (3 months after buying). Poor fabrication quality; unrepairable, and shouldn't need to for a 90-day old, gently used product"
2.0,It’s basically impossible to close after it’s in your ear. It doesn’t snap together. You have to bend it to get it in and out of the hole.
2.0,These pants have very thin material which makes them look cheap. Returned.
2.0,I ordered an x-large for my husband. Very small in size and the actual printing on the shop was poorly done. It's clear that there were parts of the screen missing when the shirt was mailed. Waste of money.
2.0,I didn't know the small clocks where only decorative and there is a small glass chip on the face. looks nice
2.0,"Like a previous comment, I received wristlet vs. cosmetic bag.  Dasein immediately responded to my comment via email.  The purse arrived damaged with huge dent in bottom which I attibute to shoddy shipping as the purse is definitely new.  It arrived in a tyvek envelope with no box or protection to keep ends from damage.  I was able to fix the damage without having to return the purse.  Overall, for the price, an okay item equal in material and quality to purses sold in Walmart/Target; just more unique."
2.0,"Cheap quality fabric. I was expecting a more denim like material as pictured, but this is thin, stretchy almost legging like material."
2.0,The pouches are pretty well made and seems like it'll hold up well but the material is definitely not microfiber and it does a pretty terrible job of cleaning glasses since it's not microfiber.
2.0,The (light & dark blue) dress is very thin and runs small.  Perhaps it could work as a swimsuit cover-up if you sized up but I think it’s too thin to wear as a dress (looks cheap).
2.0,"Unfortunately the scene split the second time I wore them. No they are not too small they were actually a bit loose. They are cute.  Also, they are not very soft."
2.0,"Very stiff fabric, did not soften with wash/drying"
2.0,i gave it away.  it was just too cheap for me but the person i gave it to really liked it.
2.0,Ran very small of an XXL when I normally take a medium. Great quality but fit was very off
2.0,"Nice looking product, and easy to get on a child's chubby foot - BUT the opening is LARGE so in rough surf the shoe falls off.  We were in Hawaii and had to purchase another pair after a few waves took these shoes right off our daughters feet."
2.0,wish I sized down. Not really compression leggings. Also theres a stain on the leg & hole in the crotch.
2.0,Horrible fit if you have dick earlobes.
2.0,"Watch was great while it lasted, but both of the straps have broken off after only a handful of wears (and NO, they can't just be popped back on, they don't stay...I tried)! My son is really disappointed that his watch is now useless!"
2.0,Not comfortable for my feet. I returned them!
2.0,The dress is super see through. I couldn’t wear it even with a slip under. The print is very cute.
2.0,"I was expecting a different color, just not what I expected."
2.0,Too small. Sleeves way too long.
2.0,I ordered a medium after reading the reviews and it’s still too big. I normally wear a 10-12 And this fits like an extra extra large. I wish I could make it work but I’m afraid I’ll have to return it. Not sure what to order now…
2.0,So sad that this is such poor quality.  I knew once I got it that it would have to be washed by hand or on a delicate cycle and hung to dry.  I have worn it 3 times and washed it carefully and hung it to dry.  It's already starting to pill.  Soon it will look too bad to wear out.  Bummer.
2.0,Not at all what we had expected. Had to return but they took care of it.
2.0,The short is nice but much larger than I expected for a small. I have been unable to return it as well because I can’t seem to get the address to return it in anything but Chinese.
2.0,"I love the neckless with Moldavite very pretty, but my neck turned black on me; its's qualities materials are low because if it were real and good qualities, it wouldn't have changed colors or stain my neck.  And I can't change the chain because it is not meant to change the neckless. Not happy with this purchase."
2.0,"The cranking mechanism is backwards and is always stuck. You have to pull on the actual frame to force it to work , and then it sounds like it’s going to pop. The pole does not align or connect well at all,  super sketchy at the connection! It is constantly turning with even the slightest breeze and repeatedly  hitting my fence. This is a very poorly made product, With a ton of major flaws. It looks great, but it is definitely not going to last the season much less into next year. Really disappointed....I would not recommend this particular version."
2.0,"A bit disappointed,  this hoodie is more lighter pink. Not neon at all. Disappointing because the neon yellow was perfect!!"
2.0,"The dress is a lot longer than I expected - it drags on the floor about 2-3 inches and my daughter is an average height 8 1/2 year old - but it fits her well every where else. It’s definitely made for very slender girls, which thankfully my daughter is. I can’t imagine that it would fit well on a heavier set or even a large boned girl. The top is also very see through and you definitely have to put something under it.<br />It is very pretty though and the color was true. My daughter loves it so we’ll probably have it hemmed to fit her. (Ignore the way the sash is in the picture- she wanted it wrapped around rather than tied! lol)"
2.0,"I bought the 0-3 for my 3 month old daughter. They were so big on her, they would not stay on. Even now at 8 months, they're still huge. Gave 2 stars since the quality is good."
2.0,"Cute bracelet, way too small for the recipient  😐"
2.0,The shorts under the skirt are much smaller than the skirt.
2.0,Didn’t like the black zipper on the front. Should have used a zipper of the color of the garment or white.
2.0,the sleeve linings won't stay put no way to tack them down i am returning this
2.0,"I am an 6'2"" 230 pound guy who typically wears an large in underwear or around 36-38"". I ordered the large as I expected and it was too tight for comfort. The pouch didn't have enough material and didn't have the room. Not sure about trying the XL. I rather try a different brand. The fabric is great and nothing rubs your skin into a rash like ultra cheap underwear. Just a shame these seem to be made for a size smaller or something."
2.0,"This is my first day wearing these socks, and they keep coming off my feet. I even sit most of the day at work, but they don't want to stay on and are even more annoying when I do walk. I can't return them either even though I received them yesterday."
2.0,They do not suck you in.
2.0,"Se cae el ojo, ni está bien puesto, me duró dos dias"
2.0,The inside fabric is very rough and itchy. I can't stand to wear it because it's uncomfortable.
2.0,They were ok. They fell out constantly and since they are clear it was really hard to find them again.
2.0,"Love these, but the elastic sucks! It's a wide elastic that flips over when you sit. I wore them twice and I spent most of my time trying to wrestle with the elastic going wonky. If it had different elastic in the waist they would be prefect. Nice material and lightweight."
2.0,Bought this jacket a few months ago. I was thrilled and excited about it. Til it tore a few months after I got it. I'd say the quality is very poor but sizing fit as expected.
2.0,Can I get new ones?  Had these only a month and a half. Run a little large.
2.0,"I didn't get what I ordered.  At all.<br /><br />I ordered the Charcoal version, but it was more of a sweatpants dull gray.  it fit well (which was awesome!) but it wasn't patterned well AT ALL.  The material was cut at the wrong angle; there were a TON of seams (I'm talking seams everywhere!); and, there was definitely no longer point in the front like it shows in the picture.<br /><br />It was cheap so I guess I can't complain too much, but I would have preferred it to be cheap cute instead of cheap and ugly."
2.0,"This is soooo small and so short. Luckily I’m not so tall, but this only reaches my shins."
2.0,"I wasn't thrilled with this set of earrings, they seemed larger than others I have purchased and had a very cheap plastic look to them. My expectations were not high, I knew I was paying very little but even with low expectations they missed the mark. I returned them. The transaction for both purchasing them and returning them was very smooth and easy."
2.0,"Although the shirt itself was actually large on me, the sleeve where is connects to the upper arm was so tight I couldn't wear the shirt, it left marks on my upper arm."
2.0,Bought it for my son. He loved the image on it (green is his favorite color). Bought it a size up so he could grow into it. Ended up being too small. Disappointed
2.0,"This is an ok costume corset, but not much else.  The boning IS metal,  I checked it with a magnet,  but I've felt stronger plastic boned corsets. This won't give you an hour glass shape if you don't already have one as it lacks any shape of its own and the boning is VERY weak. The laces are super short for a corset, allowing for only a 4 inch gap in the back when fully loosened, but that is easy enough to fix by replacing the laces. However  the modesty panel is pretty useless. It is only about 3 inches wide and it is shorter in length than the corset is by about an inch, so if you intend to use it then this is not the corset to get.  Overall if you are looking for a cheap corset for Halloween that will be comfortable for a couple hours then this is fine but that is about all it is good for."
2.0,It was all see threw
2.0,"Love it, the fit, the color, arrived here fast, it came sadly with a big hole in the armpit is my only issue"
2.0,"I wear XL in nike, adidas, and other underamour boxerjock type briefs.  These fit like whitey tidies.  Not happy with the money I spent on these...."
2.0,Product was much smaller than expected and was missing one of the tassels.
2.0,"i had rotator cuff surgery and the snaps on this shirt hit me exactly on my scars. great idea, but just did not work for me, so i am returning."
2.0,"Inferior to the Pakols I've bought in the past. Thin wool, too tight and strong smell of musty kerosene."
2.0,"Some one wasn’t paying attention. The collar was almost sewn shut.  I had alterations done, so I could wear it."
2.0,I do not like this at all. It only has a slight hint of pink. It's more clear than pink.
2.0,"As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. These earrings look very cheap and for my taste, are much too long!!"
2.0,So disappointed.  Very thin fleece like.  Way too small.  I ordered two sizes larger so it would be roomy.  It barely fits around. If you're  young or a small child this will work
2.0,"The dress is nice, lace is decent with some snags but I can fix those. The thing that bothered me the most was how dirty the dress is, maybe I would have received better quality if a new one was received but apparently this one is not, gonna have to dry clean which is actually scary in itself. But I plan to keep and use for my wedding. Very reasonable cost for something you wear once!"
2.0,"The captive bead is very difficult to put on, and is much smaller than appears in the picture. Not worth the money. I would return it if there wasn't a &#34;no return after opening&#34; policy. The circumference of the ring is far too big, It juts out."
2.0,Fit very awkwardly and so I returned it.
2.0,Stone is not fitted right and pongs aren't bent down correctly to hold the stone in place.....very pretty but not put together very well at all.
2.0,"It worked, but didn't fit my face right"
2.0,"Didn't give it a one star because at least they tried and it arrived sooner than expected..  It is VERY cheaply done patches have a leather simulation that don't really look or feel good, they fit REALLY tight even though I went up a size.  and now it's a hassle to return them they refuse to do it because it is a foreign (Asian) manufacture  I would really recommend a second thought before ordering"
2.0,"The first time I wore the socks they were very comfortable.  However, they have shrunk and I cannot get them on my foot.  I actually ripped a hole in the top of the sock trying to stretch it to fit.  Terrible sock."
2.0,"I was in high anticipation to purchase this because as a runner, I go through some low grassy terrain.  I washed my running shoes so they were very clean and dry, and then applied the protector per the direction. After two runs totaling 4 hours, my shoes had a good amount of grass and grime stains on them.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Not worth the purchase."
2.0,The buttons are held on with stretchy fabric making the front not close all they way and lays open
2.0,Its very plain not really shapely jus straight cut ehh yea i ddnt like it much
2.0,"When I ordered this wig for my daughter, I was expecting a close replica of Hannah Montana's wig. Instead, the wig is off in color and texture. It has an unattractive yellow/brassy color and no matter how much you brush it, it frizzes up. When my daughter tried it on, the fit was horrible and we could never get the bangs right. We ended up  purchasing a much better version of the wig from Claire's for $18.50. The Claire's version has great color and texture. When you compare the two side by side, the wig from Claire's is a better product -hands down."
2.0,"We typically love this brand, as the costumes we have gotten have been very reasonably priced and good quality, with an exception of this one. Within ten minutes of it being on it started falling apart. Even for an inexpensive price it should last longer than it did."
2.0,"One of my earrings, the fish inside is on the bottom and you can't tell it's a fish.  very disappointed.  Made poorly."
2.0,"Does not hold up long. First rip at seams within 3 months. Still using a year later (was a gift) but honestly don’t get this for someone. It is the hardest bag to get stuff in and out of since it lacks structure. If you have one, I think you’d understand."
2.0,Cheap price and cheap quality.  Nice color.  Would work for a costume and not much else.
2.0,The face of the watch is way too small. It is not the current style because of this issue.
2.0,Really good material but if you have any type of boob beware of side boob. I’m a 36 D and SO much side boob. I returned.
2.0,It doesn’t look anything like the picture. It was all one color and not the same shade pictured.
2.0,"I ordinarily wear a size 11 shoe.  I had to send the size 11.5 shoes back at my expense and include a $4.00 check for some reason to get a set of 12.5 shoes.  The 12.5 shoes do fit, and everything seems fine, but the expense of the shoes after the extra charge and the shipping back makes them unreasonable."
2.0,"the fabric began to tear and fall apart, so i requested a return.  i left the item in the appropriate package, with label at a UPS Access Point in Zip 45900.  There must have been a glitch with the return and the UPS Access Point.<br /><br />Service from the Company in receiving the product was just fine.<br /><br />Thanks"
2.0,"I used these for my wedding. On the outside looked like a basic sunglasses cute and well made, but once you put them on you could barely see out of them. Very few of them actually weren't blurred. I wouldn't recommend if you actually planned on being able to see out of. We also didn't notice until after we put them out so our guests were the ones to find out they were blurry."
2.0,"This dress is cotton, and it is definitely a midi length. However it fits me like a sad bathroom or nightgown. Not good for a bridal shower!"
2.0,Color is not as vibrant as photo. True color is very faded - it looks like its been washed a bunch of times or I've had it for a long time.
2.0,"Love the feel of the material. Surprised to see a “Mossimo Supply Co.” tag on it. (Target brand) It fits nicely at the hip, thighs and legs. The knee area is super tight for some reason. Length is right at ankles, may shrink sooner than later. Wish they had more length to them."
2.0,The picture wore off after about a month. I made sure not to put it in the dryer and it still peeled off.
2.0,would not fit had to give it away
2.0,"Again, the shirt was made in China!"
2.0,The tassels fell off when wearing the very first time.
2.0,Broke so fast
2.0,se oxida mu rapido
2.0,they were a little smaller than i expected
2.0,it was shorter than I expected
2.0,too big and fits awkwardly.
2.0,Fit weird. Left space in weird areas and was too tight in others.
2.0,"It was a little too small for me, but worked for the one time Halloween costume it was part of"
2.0,"It is a super cute bag and well made however the balls on the strap make the bag fall off your shoulder. It 100% will not stay on your shoulder- very annoying. Buyers beware. Also, the return process is impossible. It has me returning it to China at my own expense so I’m stuck with a non functioning bag now"
2.0,Es lindo pero correo muy grande usualmente soy mediano o small y el small me quedo flojo
2.0,The first time I wore this in the pool the colors (purple) faded and turned pink.
2.0,"not satisfied at ALL! poor quality of material, weird fit"
2.0,No beast charm
2.0,"The review from Frazzled Glispa is spot on...<br /><br />I wish I would have read the reviews prior to purchase, but I mean... it was underwear. What could go wrong? Exactly as the reviewer stated. These must be factory seconds. I have another pair, different model, of the same brand that I bought at a store and they are great quality. I thought these would be the same. One of the pairs I gave to my 6 year old son. Yes, the size was that off. On others the seams are turning to threads....<br /><br />Do not buy these! Complete waste of money. Lesson learned."
2.0,"I assumed that I would be able to see through the material but it is harder that trying to see through nylon. I was hoping to use it for Halloween but it was too difficult to see anything except if it was a bright sunny day, otherwise I can forget using these for anything. Thank goodness it wasn't an expensive purchase."
2.0,"The material was very lightweight, seams were crooked . poor quality. Paid way to much ."
2.0,"I should have known that real lapis lazuli would be much more expensive.  But I really liked the color of the stones in the picture.  They were beautiful in person,  but when I took them off after wearing them as a bracelet all day at work, some of the color had worn off on me! So after washing off my blue wrist with some disappointment I knew that I was probably not going to be able to wear them again.  Too bad."
2.0,It was larger (wider) than other 5T art & eden dresses we have.
2.0,Not bad ...
2.0,Very tight and bulgy. Not true to size. Way too small.
2.0,NOT Polarized 😡🤬. Not even close.  Not one little bit!!
2.0,Not a pure white
2.0,Depending on your body shape you may have to order up to 2 sizes bigger
2.0,Cute. Thin sweatshirt material. It was tight for a small and the sleeves were about 3 inches too short. So the model must be wearing a large or an XL bc she looks about the same size as me.
2.0,"Great necklace, but lost its color after a few days"
2.0,It was an odd fit on me and didn’t have enough elastic to be form fitting. I just use it as pajamas.
2.0,This XL is definitely an adult medium. There were strings hanging off everywhere. The quality was not great.
2.0,"Too short and the material is not one that I like, but the pants are wearable enough that I'll just keep them instead of returning."
2.0,This item worked out really well except the feather fell apart and turned my skin black.  The gloves the string was broken when I took it out of the package couldn't wear them either. I guess for the price it was a nice outfit.
2.0,The inside crotch stitching was EXTREMELY uncomfortable while running or cycling.  I like the look but I can't wear them to work out again.  They are shorter than they appear as well.
2.0,"It could just be one bad stitch, but one of the socks has a hole after one wear and one wash. The rest of them seem fine - though it's been a week and I still haven't worn every pair twice.<br />The colors... you're going to love them or hate them.  But they're soft and comfortable.  They're not as dry feeling/absorbent and wicking as https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JYAHELK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 - but they're also 5 pairs for the price of one of the Fox Rivers.<br />They're also not as soft as the Wigam Ironman either - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PZMAOW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1  but again - for the price, not bad.<br /><br />I wish that one didn't have a hole already.  They'd easily be a 4 star - or - considering the price, 5.  They are pretty thin, so don't expect them to be super warm. But they are comfortable, and do have a lower cut than the fox river or wigwams posted above.  But for a decent every day sock - assuming the one hole - at the seam in one of them - is a fluke, they're decent.  Especially if you're trying to add some color to your home life.  They shouldn't be visible while you're keeping your shoes on."
2.0,The model must be so small!
2.0,"In all fairness, this is a credit card holder, not a wallet.  Two slabs of carbon fiber with a relatively wide and strong rubber band on the outside keeping the contents supposedly secure.  It works, but with a few problems and design flaws.  The edges are sharp, the &#34;fanning&#34; simply does not work with more than maybe three or four credit cards at most, and it's difficult to remove a card.  The outer band is made to hold bills, but they must be folded in half and then folded again to properly fit.  The band isn't strong enough to hold anything more than ten bills and you risk the possibility of your cash falling out while you fumble to remove a card.  Comes in a little gift box with an extra band.  It is lightweight &#34;wallet&#34; but a real hassle.  Amazon sells a multitude of RFID front-pocket wallets.  Can't recommend this one unless you only want a very minimum credit card holder."
2.0,Didn't like the fact that I soon as I took the wings out the package feathers were falling off.
2.0,"Overall, it’s cute. But the fabric is scratchy even after a couple washes. And buyer beware, it’s see through. You would need a slip if you wear it as a dress and it’s short so that’s tough.<br /><br />I am 5’8” and no way could wear as a dress so maybe a petite woman can.<br /><br />It’s just ok. Be careful about blogger reviews."
2.0,They are dark even on a bright sunny day.
2.0,It is very see through
2.0,"In the 5 months I've had these shorts I have probably worn and washed them less than 10 times. I ordered a size too large, so they are not overly snug. Nonetheless, one of the seams next to the pocket has already torn and is unraveling."
2.0,colors are great but poor quality.  some have fallen apart already.
2.0,"I bought these just for the summer to work at the hospital. They only lasted the summer (3 mo). Some backings turned green and some broke. They did what I wanted them to, but I dont recommend if you’re looking for anything durable."
2.0,Beautiful shoe but the leather is just not durable enough for kids. It’s an unfinished raw type of leather that nicks and scratches very easily. If the leather were more finished then the shoe would get 5 stars otherwise
2.0,"These boots are too lightweight and thin for any heavy use.  They look great but they aren't holding up to everyday wear and tear.  The soles began peeling off after 6 weeks.  The leather looks and feels nice, but this is a fashion boot only.  Look for something else if you need solid everyday wear"
2.0,broke within hours of putting it on my key chain
2.0,Not leather cut small
2.0,"Works as shape wear if you can stand wearing it. Extremely uncomfortable, hooks dig in"
2.0,"Paint came fight off, holes weren’t accurate , cheaply made"
2.0,Tops were large for the size ordered. Material was not quality feel.
2.0,This is supposed to be pink but there is NO color to this jewelry. There’s nothing about it to draw the eye. The set is very bland and doesn’t complete the outfit. It’s just..... nothing.
2.0,"I ordered these for a prop, for my children’s Halloween costumes. They look great just like the picture, but my kids broke them within seconds of having them. These are very very cheap."
2.0,It's definitely not like the picture
2.0,Didnt work for me. Maybe I got a size that was too small. It constantly rode up. I got a Med and I'm size 8.
2.0,"Looks like the casting used was oval not round and there is not black inlaid paint to help distinguish the silver of the compass. I knows it only a $11 ring but come on, make it look like picture"
2.0,good but cant but wear thick socks with it cause it will attach to the sock then break
2.0,finger print magnet
2.0,"I ordered bike shorts from the same brand that are truly high waist and soft, buttery fabric. I was hoping the same for these. The blue/black camo print is cute. I really wanted to love these. But the fabric is different. Not a lot of stretch in them and the back gaped open a little. Was really hoping they would fit since I ordered an XXL and I love the print. I am a size 14/16, 5'9"" and 215. These still felt too tight."
2.0,I've ordered Vox in the past. These are cheaply made.
2.0,Good quality just to heavy of material
2.0,I was very disappointed to find it was more yellow than a cream color :( and to even put a photo in you would have to glue it 👎🏼👎🏼
2.0,"The dress is cute and a good fit, but mine arrived with a small hole in it and even after a few washes, it smells strongly of chemical preservatives."
2.0,Runs small through the shoulders and chest. Very large everywhere else.
2.0,"Tarnished within a week, I do not recommend it! it now looks coper in color not gold ;-("
2.0,"I like the way the sunglasses fit, however, the bi-focals aren't aligned properly - higher on one lens than the other.  Very hard to look through."
2.0,"It is not sturdy. chain broke on day one. also it hangs the wings & pearl to the underside of your arm, due to the weight I believe. the little clasp chain is what is visible to others!"
2.0,The arms are way to short.
2.0,"Everything was great about this dress but the zipper didn't work the min I got it. I didn't have a chance to change dresses before my son's graduation outside the state. I ended up having to replace the entire zipper on the dress, at least I know how to do that, otherwise: this would be a waste of money."
2.0,They are too small for a Septum piercing for me.
2.0,"Its not a phone case its more like a purse if its not what your looking for then don't buy it, theres other phone cases that actualy do go around the phone"
2.0,"These lights had alot of problems staying lit, and lighting up in the first place. Out of 40 about 5 of them didn't work. But the kids I bought them for LOVED them."
2.0,Doesn't fit true to size I got a large like I always do and it doesn't fit.  Now I have two shirts I can't wear.
2.0,"The seams are really not sewn well, they work fine for compression but they are very thin!"
2.0,"Very cheap, thin material. Never wore it."
2.0,"This hat is ok, but the quality is poorer than it looked in the picture. It's more of a hat you'd do gardening with, not the kind you'd take to the beach or a park."
2.0,Fit was fine on the dress. The quality was very poor. Dress looked like I was a stiff table cloth. Very cheap material to make this dress. Have found the same one but much better material.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this dress from the other purchaser's images, but this dress did not fit me well. I bought my normal size, but this dress was super form fitted and several inches shorter than I expected. I would recommend sizing up from your usual size if you'd like to give this dress a try."
2.0,I ordered the Rose Red and received the Pink instead. I purchased my normal size according to the sellers measurement chart not Amazon's and it fit great but the pink is a little sheer so I would have to wear a cami with it and then it would probably be too small. I didn't care for the material. It almost looks and feels like sleepwear from the 60's. I will be returning it.
2.0,"This is very short, and sit awkwardly for plus size women"
2.0,"I'm always a small, I ordered the 30W 30L and could barely get them on."
2.0,Corren pequeños
2.0,"After one month of wear, the bottom of the socks began tearing in between the seams. If you depend on compression socks for daily use, I would not recommend this brand.  The price is definitely appealing but the quality does not hold up."
2.0,I ordered two pair. One pair was broken. They are a little awkward when trying to put in the backs.
2.0,"Even with a French tuck, the small was way to big for my taste. A cute knot didn't work either because the arms were to baggy."
2.0,Sizes run small. Thin material too.
2.0,Color is of and cheap material
2.0,"I bought this product last year for my daughter. since she is getting taller, I just bought a bigger one for her from the same amazon link. quality of the old one, which was made in China, was very good, The new one, which is made in Guyana, has nothing to compare with the old one, very poor stitching and low quality material. The new one is a intermediate 6-8 and is only about 2cm longer than the old one, which is a size small 4-6. I hope I could find the old batch leotards and buy several of different size."
2.0,Way small so my teen daughter has worn over a dress twice and already it's coming apart at seams.  Not made well!
2.0,"Oh no, I don’t think anyone wants to wear this fabric. It looks straight out of the 1970’s and not in a cool retro way. Total return. Didn’t even try it on because it was just bad. However, it did appear to run true to size."
2.0,"Very cool robe made of soft plushy material. It was described as a men's robe but after trying it on, I could see it was clearly tailored for a woman. LG/XL size was way to small for my husband, who normally wears a large size."
2.0,I hadn't realized I bought high-rise panties. I'm way too short. They almost hit my bra. Lol
2.0,Bad quality it broke in less than 1 month
2.0,Really cute at the beginning but it turned black right away. Not worth it.
2.0,didnt fit my watch
2.0,It fell off at soccer field. The clip doesn't stay on well at all. The magnet is a little better but still not reliable. I wish I had not bought it.
2.0,"Lo vi muy bonito y lo compre pero perdí mi dinero es tan pequeño es para niña, deberían especificar el ancho"
2.0,Great looking glasses. Not polarized as described. All polarized glasses turn computer screen dark when rotated 90 degrees.
2.0,"it was very pretty but turned very fast,"
2.0,Kind of stupid looking.  My husband will not wear it.
2.0,returned this dress. fit was very awkward. I am 5'3 140 & it didn't fit me at all. the gathering below the bust hit me on my bellybutton.
2.0,"one word China . I bought two sizes s m, as you can see, they are the same . The blouse is cute, but synthetic and short, even for 5.1 fit"
2.0,"It's like wearing a burlap sack. Even after washing quite a few times, it still feels ridiculous abrasive."
2.0,"I purchased this bag through the little unicorn website. It's very clunky, and after about 5mo use, the magnet closures for the outside pockets separated from the bag. The straps started peeling and the entire bag eventually started to just collapse after everyday use. It has almost no shape vertically, anymore. But it's still shapely enough for me to run into people with it if I have it hanging on my shoulder.  Not a fan. Sad cause it's a cute bag"
2.0,My daughter is one of the tallest girls in her class and these pants fit around the waist but are about 4-5 inches to long. I don't know many kids built like this. Unfortunately she didn't try them on till it was past the return date.
2.0,They’re soooo cute BUT I’ve had them for a couple weeks and have already changed colors!  The “gold” faded.
2.0,"Has a tight/small snug fit. If you have a lot of hair or a bigger head, this isn't for you. Uncomfortably tight."
2.0,"Really cute shirt but ordering my size it was too tight across the chest and actually kind of short, too."
2.0,It is more of a brown than purple and it doesn't for my turbo 2
2.0,"Looks nice on but very cheaply made.  When it arrived, the blue plastic sapphire looking stone had come off in the packaging and had to glued back on."
2.0,I was not satisfied with the quality of this purse. I decide to purchase it due to the 5 stars reviews by previous buyers. From my point of view the purse feels heavy and stiff and does not resemble real leather at all. I have real leather purses and they do not feel and look like the leather of this purse. Regarding its size it is small for my usual women accessories and paperwork.
2.0,Too tight and I did not like fabric.
2.0,So sad! These were just delivered and I had them in for less than an hour and the post already broke off :(<br />2 stars because they're cute though ;)
2.0,I have a larger face theses glasses are just a little small
2.0,One sock came with a hole. I hope the other pairs survive the first wash. I was really hoping for better quality.
2.0,There is plenty of room in lower leg area. Too tight in hip area.
2.0,Really wanted to love this necklace because it's so feminine but alas the quality was cheap and it kept getting tangled. Wore it for about two weeks before it finally broke.
2.0,Very pretty but broke within a month of purchase. wish they made it a bit more durable.
2.0,Super thin and uncomfortable.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this shirt but beware this is one of those dreaded ill fitting t-shirts. It is not cut well for women. It is loose around the chest and tight around the hips and tummy, to make you feel like an overpacked sausage. The material seems nice, the red was a nice red and the design was so cute! But the fit left a lot to be desired. As reference I am 5'8"" about 165 and have a mom bod (larger chest/momma tummy) and had a large."
2.0,This top had such a cute style but the shoulders were enormous. Perhaps it would fit a fuller figured woman better.
2.0,"I should have read more reviews and ordered a size larger.  But my biggest complaint is that I ordered Lavender and what I received is like a dusty plum.  Not what I was going for.  They say that the color may be different on your monitor but this was way off.  However, for the price it seems like a nice sweater.  I returned it but may consider ordering from a different vendor."
2.0,"Shipping was fast, but the hat is cheaply made for the price, it appears it was crushed before packed, has a bad crease top of hat,  if you have a larger head same will fit, but for price I would not recommend."
2.0,The print and the material is very pretty but there’s a distinct smell on the mask itself like the smell of a newly printed newspaper.  The smell dispersed after a while though.
2.0,"Return de product, it is too big and heavy"
2.0,I bought a XL and in the torso area was way too short!!!  I could not understand why it was so small. I thought it first maybe the straps were twisted in some sort of way but it was not. Nice design bathing suit however the size is not accurate. I almost couldn’t even get it over my shoulders.
2.0,"la bolita plateada es la que debería desenroscarse, pero no, es la bolita con diseño la que desenrosca. no vuelvo a comprarlos"
2.0,"For the sizes listed of small, medium and large it would be better to put an actual size of what the small medium and large really are. Also I thought I'd get a pack of 4 different bright colors. Black and grey aren't bright."
2.0,"This is a perfect Motorcycle leather, it's excellent quality. It is heavy and how it should be for proper protection. The problem is it runs way too small and the sleeves are excessively too long, as if made for an ape. I am a Large and had to return it for 2XL. If you ride in cold weather you may need to go up 3 sizes for extra layers. I originally ordered a Large and couldn't get it zipped, so I went up 2 sizes since it was so small, glad I did."
2.0,Cute cut small bought xlg
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:74f37640c4c8d65fbff60850d5f10984]] Let me start out by saying I am a corset veteran. I buy and wear a variety of corsets to compliment my Renaissance fair costumes. I usually do not buy corsets off of Amazon, but I decided to take a chance because I was offered this corset at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I am giving it two stars because there are a couple positives about this product:<br />- First of all, the price. Around $25 is very cheap for a corset.<br />- The design is beautiful. The fabric is gorgeous and the buckles and straps look really cool.<br /><br />Now for the negatives:<br />- The sizing seems to be way off. I went off of their sizing chart and found a size that was supposed to fit me, but even with the laces pulled out all the way there was no way I could get this on. I do not think they should offer plus sized corsets (XX large) if they do not fit plus sized women.<br />- On closer inspection it seems that they used super long shoe laces for the lacing on the back of the corset. Something I have not seen before. (Seen in video)<br />- Right out of the package there were loose threads poking out of the seams. (Seen in video)<br />- The boning on the corset is flimsy. It is too easy to manipulate, which causes it to not keep its shape and support."
2.0,The dress isn't floor length as the photo portrays. More of a tea length dress. The bodice is tshirt material. My girls wear them for dress up play since they were too short
2.0,"I love the material, BUT... the torso was abnormally​ long and one sleeve was wider than the other. So disappointed."
2.0,"The skirt part is very cute, but the bodice part is made from dullish jersey material which doesnt match the fanciness of the skirt. Also, the bodice fits small and doesnt lay correctly"
2.0,Returned it immediately.
2.0,"These are cheap, and they should be because they aren't worth much.  I found myself constantly tugging the waistband up because it would not stay up and noticed the elastic inside is twisted. I can't smooth it because it was sewn twisted.  Adding to the tendency to pull down is the fact that they are too small in the legs.  I had a lot of trouble pulling them over my calves."
2.0,This is a completely different dress then what is pictured on here. And it has a weird slit in the middle. I don’t know how to feel about it to be honest. I’m pretty sure I’ll be returning this.
2.0,I got this for my daughter's 7th birthday and it finally got here with a knot in the chain that I CAN'T get out. Pretty disappointed 🥺<br />The A is super cute and I was so excited for it.
2.0,Peeling
2.0,Not great if you have a large chest. Buttons line up weird across the chest.
2.0,"I've bought many watches on Amazon and they all arrived in perfect condition from the way it's packaged, delivery time, and the watch itself. Poor packaging is very rare from my experience shopping on Amazon. I had a problem with the poor packaging (invoice wrinkled up, watch case damaged..etc.) by the seller but Amazon took care of it 100% and I'm happy with the result. I appreciate the professionalism of Amazon despite the problem that happened. It shows the buyer that things like this can happen and Amazon will always have a solution to it. Thanks to Kelly from Amazon who took care of the problem! I know the review should not be about problems with the seller but I think future buyers who are not confident about buying watches online can benefit from my experience.<br /><br />Anyways, this review should be about the watch. The watch looks great for business and casual attire. If you want a clean looking watch, this is it! I love the design and this is exactly what I've been looking for if only the quality lived up to the brand name...... The bracelet is ok....If someone asks you if they can put the watch on their wrist, they would be surprised by the low quality stainless steel.. They will most likely ask you if your watch is genuine or not. It's not something you would expect from a $200 watch and from Armani...I own a different Armani on leather band and I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />09/26/11<br />Update: I returned this because the chronograph was a little crooked...It didn't line with dial marks....If it was a 50 dollar watch I wouldn't have cared but I paid over $200 so I had to return it."
2.0,This dress could've been so cute if executed properly. It was sewn really lopsided and the string for tying it is super cheap and ugly.
2.0,"I am 5”2 and weigh 145 lbs. I usually wear a medium in everything so I bought this in a medium (army green color). I truly love the color (looks like the image) but the fit isn’t what the image portrays. This shirt is not flowy. I bought it to cover my bottom and it doesn’t cover it totally. Also, the shirt is pretty tight. The good thing about the shirt is that it is a soft and comfortable material. Regardless, this fit is not something I would want to work out in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this came with white marks in the front of the shirt and some in the back. Also came extremely wrinkly."
2.0,It looks good but is not 100% cotton as advertised. It is 100% polyester.
2.0,"The necklace is cheaper looking when I got than how it looked online. I thought it would be better quality, but still a nice necklace anyway."
2.0,"I had to order this item 3 times before they actually sent me the right size, but regardless of which size they sent the band that goes around the ribcage was RIDICULOUSLY big!  It is slightly adjustable, but not enough.  The medium bottoms fit well enough (I'm a size 6-8) but the top just hung there not even touching my body.  The cup size was smaller in the medium vs the large but not the other part.  I'm a 34C, so I'm not unusually small in the ribs.  Medium tops usually fit me.  That said, the suit did seem like good quality and I love the cut and colors.  I returned it but would have totally kept it were it not for the strange sized top."
2.0,"I’m really hoping I got a dud product.<br />I have never given a one star review before. I’m usually not very critical.<br />For reference, I’m 5’7, 115lbs, 32A, 27”Waist and have a Small. It fits me like a VERY tight XS. (Sorry, I will update model pics later). The 100% super organic fabric is extremely rough and the fit is certainly not relaxed, just boxy and restricting. The neck alone was so tight and constricting. Also the bottom hem hits very high. The white panels of fabric are completely transparent (not cool for a piece at this price point).<br /><br />The worst part is the smell. For something so toxin-free and organic, it arrived smelling like it just came out of a chemical bath. I know things can happen during packaging and shipping by other parties, but this chemical stench was embedded in the fabric. I washed it three times and it didn’t fade at all. It was folded on top of another one of my shirts and within two hours THAT shirt stunk like crazy too.<br /><br />The description states it is made in the USA, but the tag says “Made in India,” and “Designed in NY.” That doesn’t count and is a straight lie to consumers.<br />They really push how organic it is (so many tags), which is great, but are they trying to guilt me into paying almost $80 for a super uncomfortable overpriced undersized random stink top?<br /><br />What I DO like is the quality of craftsmanship (despite the see-through fabric), the colors/color-block design, and the ribbed texture on the underarms/sides/hems is a nice contrast. Not worth much though.<br /><br />Honestly, I had no idea what this was made with in mind -maybe some type of activewear? But because of the constricting fabric and tight fit, it is not easy to move around in. Definitely not meant to be “loungewear” of any kind. If you go up two sizes it may be bearable.<br />As you can see, I do not recommend this. MAYBE - if you really dig the design, order up two sizes, you can enjoy a very expensive and uncomfortable pullover.<br /><br />If you’ve made it this far, Thank you for reading. I will be back to update."
2.0,The struggle to get the head hole over my hips and ass was annoying ! The material gives a lot once you get it over ur lady lumps but the crotch fits weird can’t pull it all the way up
2.0,Tight fit around things and little room at knee.  These won’t do for hiking. Also these can only be air dried according to care tag. That’s gross. Hiking pants soaked in sweat and then not dried with heat of clothes dryer will become a science experiment. Disappointing purchase.
2.0,Fits in the chest.  The blouse appears longer in length in the picture than it is. I would not have chosen it
2.0,These were fine while they lasted. My daughter is 3 and I wouldn't say particularly that she doesn't know how to handle the sunglasses but they broke right at the top  along one of the lenses. I tried to glue but not sure that is really a permanent fix. Will be getting something more rubbery and durable the next time. They were cute!
2.0,Compass does not work .Otherwise it's okay.
2.0,"The quality & actual fit of the dress were great. Sadly, the pockets wouldn’t lay flat. They seem misplaced?"
2.0,"I have a 30-31 waist and am fairly athletic built, so I ordered the medium (32-34) size. The underwear did not properly accommodate my man parts, as they did not have much of a pouch. I returned them."
2.0,"I got these for my wife. She is normally an x-small and got a small. They were still snug and uncomfortable. Opening the package, my wife said they had an unpleasant smell. Overall, she was disappointed and does not think they are worth the price."
2.0,"These are not just inexpensive but they are cheap. Cheap quality, cheap fabric, cheap construction. I've washed these once and there is a hole and run in the fabric."
2.0,I really like these socks when I first got them they fit great stayed up great. But after 20-30 times of wearing them the bottom heel part wore out. So good socks for a short time
2.0,"Honestly, I am not a big fan of this purse.  It just looks kind of like something ""Peggy Bundy"" would carry on Married With Children.  I hate to say it but it looks sort of cheap and gawdy.  If you do like the leopard print look you might like this bag.  The bag portion is completely clear.....the trim is leopard print.  The material appears to be a thicker plastic and it seems as if it will hold up well with normal, every day use......."
2.0,It constantly comes undone
2.0,These pants are very comfy and lightweight. But the elastic broke in the ankle of the right leg the first day I wore them. It's a shame because I really liked them.
2.0,Fit perfect and worked well until one of the straps broke two weeks later. Sent back. Hoping to receive refund soon. Would not recommend.
2.0,This one kind of fits a little awkward and cheaply made. I wish I could return but it took me a while to get around to trying it on and has passed the return date. I’m making this review in hopes of helping someone not make my mistake. I’m 5”6” and I weigh 200Ibs give or take I ordered a large. The outfit fits it’s just not very flattering. The waist band doesn’t come up quite enough to stop my love handles from spilling over the sides. And some of the thread down the center is unraveling and I haven’t worn them once. The bra fits nice and snug but again the material is a bit cheap. I’ll try to take a picture once I get home so y’all can see what I’m talking about.
2.0,These do not look like the picture. They have an odd fit due to the non-slip nose piece. They come up so high that the bifocal is high. It makes it difficult to see. The cases are wonderful but I wish they would have put the money into the glasses rather than providing a case. I will be returning them.
2.0,Beautiful dress but not true to size
2.0,They are great if you have a big head
2.0,Very lightweight fabric with no firm control at all. I guess the polka dots are just supposed to make you look smaller because the fabric does absolutely nothing.
2.0,These were HUGE! I returned them.
2.0,"The necklace looked nice on and was great quality, but due to the design, the opening at the bottom of the charm got snagged on some clothing and broke the loop that held the charm to the necklace."
2.0,The waist was fine.  But want cut for anyone that might even have a slight bust line.
2.0,Very durable and the handle is awesome but it smells very strongly of chemicals and it’s overwhelming. Got here faster than it said which was amazing but the chemical smell ruined all the good points of the case.
2.0,i LOVE this bag! it is the perfect size and the outside material is durable and stylish. HOWEVER the inside completely tore and ripped within 2 weeks. I looked to re order another one and the price is now TRIPPLE what I paid.  So disappointed with the quality and di heartand that I cant just order another and return the ripped one for the same price i paid.  If vendor reads this and can help please reply.  I am still within my return window.  i just want a replacement bag. TYSM
2.0,While this is absolutely beautiful I spent over an hour trying to get it on my galaxy watch only to realize there's an extra piece on the end that did not allow the pins to line up and I have to shave it off with a knife to even get it latched on and the clasp to tighten it is a nightmare
2.0,"Well made and stylish but made for very thin ladies, not your average woman"
2.0,"Although its a pretty bra, its not what I expected at all. They run a bit small. Then on the boob part the edge was pointing outward. So when I had any blouse on, you can see the edge of the bra in the middle of my chest. Not at all what I'd like in a bra."
2.0,Not at all what i expected. Does not work as well as described. Extremely disappointed.
2.0,Size chart was not accurate-Way to big!
2.0,This swim suit was not made for anyone size lg. with any sort of breast.  The picture is very deceiving.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:f7fb6a854edcc4718c8dc8736573d0a9]] You don’t receive what’s pictured. The whole shape and crystals are completely different. You shouldn’t really expect much for $3 I mean the price may be the only accurate thing, if that even. Not worth the wait :/"
2.0,Cute hoodie but not great quality. It’s all pilled up after only one wash. Also not very soft.
2.0,Didn't worth the money.
2.0,Top of one of the belly rings already broke in half. Waste of money.
2.0,"The material on the collar and sleeves is a bit flimsy, it didn’t sit on my shoulders the way it appears online. Overall the fit was good, but the details of the dress which I loved in the pictures, turned out to be a let down."
2.0,Love the colors but not very well made.
2.0,"Returned mine too.  I normally order a medium or a large in sports bras.  Like the other reviewer, I could not even get it over my shoulders. I don't know what large this was, but it didn't fit at all.  I'm returning it.  It was so small I don't think reordering the XL would even work.  Other than that it was cute, decent material.  It's a shame it wouldn't fit."
2.0,Dress material feels very cheap and looks like I’m wearing a plastic bag
2.0,"Quality is really bad, different from the picture"
2.0,Returned the PJs.
2.0,Fabric is cheap.  Color is odd.  Super shiny.  Can't expect too much for such a cheap price.
2.0,It’s a good product but I only got 2 & missing the one with the EKG design on it. I gave 2 stars since I only got 2 out of 3 hats. I should give it 1 star for them not responding to my emails.
2.0,"I am 5'5 I wear a size large shirt sometimes a medium depending on brand and I wear size 5 pants. I don't think I'm large but average. I ordered this really adorable bathing suit in xxl.  It did fit around me with no problems but it's like the torso was made too short, the cups wouldn't make it to my chest without giving me a huge wedgie. So I contacted customer service which was a great experience with that. They were very helpful and they sent me the next size up, which is a xxxl the largest size that they offer. When I revceived it, it was still adorable. This time it did make it to my chest and I was able to tie it without a wedgie but still didn't fit right on my chest, it seems like the larger size has a smaller cup size.  One of the metal rings didn't have a back to keep it on so it feel off and of course wouldn't stay on. For a very small girl this would like nice on. Unfortunately it was not for me or my size. The bathing suit had no weird smell and besides the metal ring issue the rest of the material was well made and sewn.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review of it. I do not let a discounted price of any product  influence  my opinion or views of a product. I was not offered any sort of discount or compensation for a better review. I am not in  any way affiliated with this company or Amazon. All of the above opinions are honest and my own."
2.0,very flimsy and my cards fall out.
2.0,So the waistband is true to size.  The leg holes are WAY to big.  I had to return.
2.0,"My 14 year old daughter purchased this bra. She wore it yesterday under a blouse. Unless you wear something super thick, the lace will be seen. The bra itself does not offer support. It's strictly for appearance. This is not an issue with her too much...yet but it's something I always notice since I have a large chest (34G) and she isn't exactly flat chested (32D). I would not recommend this bra for anyone who requires a supportive bra."
2.0,"Maybe it would look better on someone with really dainty hands. The settings are not secure either. I like the look of this ring, but the stones were loose when it arrived. So yeah."
2.0,"I so wanted to love these! The colors are amazing and they fit pretty well. My  issues are that these show ALL of your pus print and gives camel toe no matter how you try and adjust. The high waist also rolls down and IMO the waist should have more “tummy control”. Like I said, they fit good and great colors but the camel toe print was a deal breaker for me. Sadly, they will be returned."
2.0,"Cute, but the trucks are mislabeled."
2.0,"This was to be a birthday gift. It will be going back. There are about 0 loose threads that will come loose if I touch them, there are 2 areas (one at collar and one where 2 layers of skirt that meets bodice that aren't sewn together at all. Understanding it will be a lesser quality fabric but there are holes. Very disappointing."
2.0,I thought this dress would flow a little but it was skin tight :(
2.0,The Velcro on these isn’t very strong. The shoes came loose when I was walking. They are comfortable but I need them to stay on especially while I’m working.
2.0,"They are very cheap looking, they do not stay on your ear as a climber, they hang down.  I also did not get the prime price &amp; tried to cancel &amp; correct within 30 minutes of ordering &amp; could not cancel-  I am going to return- not worth the money."
2.0,"as everyone else said, waaaaay too large in the chest area (5'5&#34; 140lbs 34D cup) and if you don't have a safety pin to keep everything together, wear at your own risk. when trying it on, I noticed a slight color difference on the thigh, like a chemical stain? it was also wrinkled beyond recognition. because the material is soft and comfortable I would probably try or order again and hope for a better pair."
2.0,Wahed before wearing and good sized hole in middle front haven't even worn yet.  Disappointed
2.0,Way to sheer!!
2.0,If you usually wear XS or small then you’d need to buy a large. Otherwise look elsewhere.
2.0,"Very cute bracelet to pair up with others, the clasp popped off the end making it unwearable, I returned the item and was refunded."
2.0,We got the dress today and opened up the package and it does not contain enough material to have any of the fullness that the online photo has.  It seems like the marketing on the Amazon store front is a bit deceptive.
2.0,"So, I ordered two different swimsuits and this one I opened one a month later after ordering it (my mistake), and I just noticed that the back strap it's all ripped off and that it has a scratch on the mesh part in the front of the swimsuit. I already lost the return window and now I'm stucked with a new but damage swimsuit. Fit me ok but a bit big as well."
2.0,This dress was made horriblebly
2.0,"Be aware the blue color is not as shown: it's very, very dark and almost black (at least the one I received was). Quality wise I'd also say that this bag is way overpriced as the material, padding, zippers, etc., feel pretty cheap which was quite a surprise. The shoulder pad and strap is probably the worst part and feels like something off of a free trade-show hand-out bag. The side-loading style was also somewhat clumsy as the zipper doesn't really open up enough to get my smaller ILC mirrorless camera in and out easily, and the insert only installs in the one direction so you cannot turn it to place the camera in from the top if using a larger lens. Also be aware that it's not Prime so return postage/shipping will cost you a bit due to the size of the box.<br /><br />Overall, not happy. Expected a much higher quality product based on the marketing and price. First bad purchase experience in quite awhile. :("
2.0,"Fits as expected. But the quality is not worth the price. The material is so thin, I got the black one and it’s kinda of seethrough of how thin it is.<br />UPDATE: after first wash the black blouse is not so faded"
2.0,"It is a well built vest, lots of pockets, pretty much just exactly what I needed, except for one thing, THE ZIPPER WAS, IS ON THE WRONG SIDE. That makes it a little awkward. My need out weighed the awkwardness, and the fact that some folks may consider I am wearing feminine apparel. It definitely is not female garb. the zipper thing is a mistake. I am wondering if it isn't factory seconds that are being sold for top prices..? Anyway two stars is all it gets."
2.0,a large is really a medium
2.0,"THOMAS HELMET: Material is sound, but this isn't something you'd want to wear straight out if the box. Box was almost too small for the helmet, so when I received it, the helmet was misaligned and the visor was starting to pop off where it was glued.<br /><br />The LEDs on the visor work, but there's only two real outputs for when it picks up sound, so it's more like a bunch of flashing lights blinking at the same exact time.<br /><br />It works, but I wouldn't buy this for anything more than one party.<br /><br />Also, this helmet is pretty small. I have an average sized head, but even after I corrected the defects, it was still a pain to put on and take off.<br /><br />GUY MANUEL HELMET: The helmet itself was straight but the amount of glue they used to &#34;try&#34; and put the visor on was disgusting, and the visor wasn't even attached. This looked like a horrible case of just shooting glue all over the place, slapping the visor on, and sending it off. This, as well, will take a weekend to fix. This issue is even more surprising considering the price point, where you expect the manufacturer to make sure crap looks okay before shipping.<br />Not worth it at this cost."
2.0,Me mandaron una talla equivocada
2.0,Its way smaller then described and color is more redish. Don't like it at all.<br />The fabric though seems sturdy.
2.0,"This watch has a black stripe on the top and bottom of the green face.  Had I known this, I would not have ordered it.  I thought it faded to a darker green.  At this point I will keep it, but probably won't order from this company again. Otherwise it looks nice and appears to function appropriately."
2.0,"I ordered an XL and it was tight, definitely order a few sizes larger. I&#34;m giving mine to my daughter otherwise I would return."
2.0,The shirt is scratchy on the inside
2.0,Incredibly cute outfit but Its way too big!! I bought 0-3 month and it is definitely going to swallow my kiddo. I am super disappointed.
2.0,The posts bent when I tried to put them on- very weak post
2.0,"PROS: (A.) Overall concept (B.) The color (C.) Different parts of the jacket reflect differently depend on the light setting. No 2 people are going to see it exactly the same. (D.) Crazy obsessed w/ the broach. Simple, but effective.<br /><br />CONS: (A.) Sleeves are Extremely Loose. Definitely would require tailoring. (B.) The Top half made me look bigger then what I am. (C.) Construction. Construction. Construction. It’s poorly sewn. (D.) The faux pockets (or if unsewn for actual pockets) are an eye sore. Would look much sharper without them. If you’re buying this, you’re getting it to look stylish. So while pockets create functionality, they take away from the stylish holographic part of this look. (E.) The button look so cheap, especially when contrasted against the color which looks more Laux. (F.) One Button.... if this button down the rest of the way, it would give the appearance of a smaller waist. BUT it doesn’t. A missed opportunity design wise.<br /><br />OVERALL: Idea, color, broach accessory+++, but poor design, construction & fit make this both frustrating & disappointing at the same time."
2.0,well my daughter was playing in a school gym and the leg of it kinda got a hole in it
2.0,The bathing suit is cute but the bottoms were  big and the bow kept falling out/off. The tags are on the outside and for some reason mine came with pen mark on the top.
2.0,"The Town Timw 22mm Leather Black Watch Band arrived in large box with no cushioning, peanuts or foam.  The watch band does not appear to be leather as advertised in the product description, nor is it particularly well constructed or of high quality materials. One of the pins is broken so I cannot attach both pieces to the watch. That said, when the seller sends a replacement pin,  it should serve its purpose as a very, very inexpensive and functional secondary watch band."
2.0,Not as pretty as pictured PLUS one earring came apart just removing it from the package.
2.0,"I purchased a pair for boyfriend, which he absolutely loved. After wearing them one time, the screws started come out. So disappointing."
2.0,Cheaply made I can barely see the capy it’s not as dark as the picture at all !! It’s a gift so if the person doesn’t like it either I’ll be returning it!
2.0,"Found a hole as soon as I unpacked them. Disappointed, as they are a nice medium weight to wear inside boots, and can be pulled up to the knees for more warmth with leggings."
2.0,"IF you get this, order at least 2 sizes up!!!! I got my usual size and it is fine when standing up, but the minute you sit down the buttons are holding on for dear life , especially on the waist and legs! I've got an hourglass shape, not heavy (5'9"", 175 lbs for reference), so I was not expecting that. I feel like the wrong move when sitting will send one of these buttons into outer space. also, the fabric in-between separates, so HELLOOOOOO legs, belly, underwear. I'm all on display. If I didn't have a long jacket over it today I'd have to go home from work just to change. The buttons also don't like to stay buttoned....so that's fun.<br />really sad because it was so cute standing up."
2.0,"This scarf is soft, but the thread gets easily caught (especially on velcro) & pulls out of the fabric.  Already ruined after a few short uses."
2.0,"This looks super cute, but it broke off the chain the first day and we had to rig it to make it work.  Also, it is really hard to get a picture in it because there is not an opening, so you you just have to smash a picture in the middle.  The pics kept falling out."
2.0,This is a awkward fitting dress it is very modest just very awkward fitting I would not recommend
2.0,The button for one of the pockets broken completely off the shorts after the first use
2.0,"The stride is ridiculously long… I could pull them under my arms. However the Jean wash, & quality is great. But a strange fit at best."
2.0,"The wire on this bra makes it difficult to get this on and off, it does not have much support or give.  It is rough and scratchy."
2.0,The dress itself was beautiful. The neck was extremely distorted.
2.0,"Feels soft, but size don’t fit. The elasticity is not strong enough too."
2.0,The dress looks like pajamas. The material is very thin and not good quality
2.0,Significantly smaller that an America XL. Shipped from Pakistan quickly which was a plus. Tanning smell is overwhelming.
2.0,"Cute suit, but it's too short! I have a short torso as it is, but this suit didn't cover my chest at all - I had to pull the suit up (which made it incredibly unfortable in other parts)."
2.0,Pros: They are nice warm gloves that  have a quality feel.<br /><br />Con: They are NOT touch screen and do fit a little small.<br />Do not order if your looking for touch screen
2.0,This hoodie is not comfortable nor does it keep you warm
2.0,I gave it two stars because I really like it and think it's cute but I can't dry it because it frays really bad.  Even when I take it out of the washer (I've only worn/washed it twice) the amount of strings I have to cut off is ridiculous.  Not sure how many more wears I'll get out of it before it completely disintegrates into a piece of cloth.
2.0,"Photos on site made hat appear to be much larger in size. It fits. For the price good deal, so I will keep it."
2.0,Not a cotton t shirt. Spandex clingy fabric. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,"I ordered the pink and mint green, and the colors were way off.<br />Pink looked salmon-y with dull/ dark tones rather than a light baby pink shown in the photo.<br />The ""mint green"" was a dull lightish blue, don't know how else to describe it both shirts look like different colors than the photos .<br />The sizing runs a tad small, so I would buy your regular size or one up (32 in chest, 26 in waist and the small was tight).<br />Only 2 stars because the material and fit were okay, but it's like a totally different color than they show ... deceptive"
2.0,"I have several of the short sleeve Popypung dresses and I love them. This is a different animal. First of all, the sleeves are at least 4 inches too long for me. (I do have short arms). Also it just looked terrible on my apple shaped body. Still love the short sleeved dresses though."
2.0,"Not what i thought, super big tank tops and i got mediums. Im 180lbs so a medium should be tighter not loose. Material was super cheap and spandexy."
2.0,Can't read the writing
2.0,"These pjs are very comfortable but after just 2 months, they already have 2 holes and have not even been worn very often. There fabric separated at the neck part of the top and a seam has come apart on the pants. The pjs are really cute but the fabric is definitely not sturdy."
2.0,"This is not the pant described. I've purchased at least 6 other pairs of Satinato pants and loved them all—all of them had this same description, and the style is as pictured. The pants I actually received this time are much longer, not cropped at the ankle at all, and not particularly tapered, either. They look terrible on me because the fit is completely different than this listing. Waste of money."
2.0,"This watch winder has a very distinguished look and feel.  Unfortunately, it's not so reliable.  Within weeks of purchase, one of the four winders stopped rotating.  Now, a second has stopped.  Admittedly, I purchased this item almost 2 years ago.  So 3 of the 4 winders did work for almost 2 years.  I guess my primary disappointment stems from the fact that I was expecting more from a Brookstone product.  To me, the name 'Brookstone' has always been associated with creative products built for solid and and sustained performance.  While $200 is not an exorbitant price, by any means, for a watch winder, I am pretty disappointed."
2.0,"Poor design - they break when you need them. Had them on me and my sons while skiing. Pull on them too hard and they break. Would return them but the Amazon return window is closed. Recommendation, look for another manufacturer and seller."
2.0,It fit kind of small I don't this was intended for a adult head
2.0,"Looks just like the pic, didn't turn my finger green however it broke the 2nd time i wore it and not because i was doing anything crazy"
2.0,I should have trusted the reviews that it is nearly impossible to take the links out. The watch is gorgeous and I was looking forward to wearing it but sadly I will not be able to 😞
2.0,"The fabric here is nice - although 100% polyester, it is weighty and feels good.  Sizing is the problem for these.  I am 5-7, 160lbs, 38-39 inch chest.  Most smalls fit me a bit snug in the chest but not tight down my torso.  These hung off of me more like a large than a small.  I returned them immediately."
2.0,Sorry to the size did not work for me..
2.0,La tela es espantosa
2.0,"appear cheap, the strap is way too large and makes it uncomfortable, was going to return, but they charge a 20% restocking fee and the you pay to mail."
2.0,"Leather is nice, however snaps are very weak. I ended up flinging the buckle off everytime I remove the belt. Im attempting to glue it together now to see of that helps"
2.0,"The arms of this were really clingy. They felt fine, as the fabric has stretch, but my arms looked like sausages. If you've got thin or toned arms, it may look great though! As a woman with a larger chest, I also thought this wasn't flattering. The front can be pulled forward (as depicted in the product image), but it really emphasized my chest in a not so flattering way. Material was a bit cheaper than I was expecting."
2.0,I loved them but after a month one of the deer fell off and I dont know how to fix it since I can't find the deer....
2.0,Was great for 8 months but then it stopped working☹️ Instead of just vibrating it always beeps.
2.0,"Way too small, gave it to our child"
2.0,The one handed clip is convenient but the design leaves too large a gap between my glasses lens and the sunshade lens which creates a reflective glare and interferes with my vision.  The kind with the perimeter grips hugs the lenses better and doesn't cause the glare.
2.0,Too big for my tragus piercing but will be good when I get my cartilage pierced!
2.0,"I had these rush ordered for a wedding and I only wore them for four hours, and one of them just fell off! I didn’t dance and I don’t have long hair so it’s not like it got stuck on something or I somehow knocked it off, it just fell off!!! Such a shame. Purely poor craftsmanship. The stones are beautiful and so is the tree design but I can’t believe that I only wore them for four hours and one just fell apart! This company needs to either send me a replacement or an entire new pair, that is ridiculous! If they have proper customer service and replace them I will be a happy customer but until then I would not suggest buying these. I was planning on ordering more things but not until this is taken care of, if they bother too, I hope they do!"
2.0,I ordered size 8-9 and it's more like a 10-11.
2.0,Fits nice and good weight but fell apart not as durable.
2.0,It looked really cute in the picture but the material was really thin and it was really tight.Wasn't comfortable!
2.0,"Looks nice and all that. Went to put the battery in it but there was already a battery in it and could not get the back of it on again. Once accomplished, the watch did still not work."
2.0,Did not like the way it fit and it was short in the front and u have to wear something under or u can see ur breast on side. It is cute just not for me
2.0,received the set but one of them was broken if it wasnt broken i would have given 5 stars because it is cute
2.0,"Very uncomfortable wearing it. And the material is super thin. I originally thought it has pads inside, but it didn’t. The material is soft but not soft enough for skin maybe adding pads inside would help. After a few minutes it actually hurt due to constant rubbing of skin (2 points) and the sport bra."
2.0,Made of very cheap material but you get what you pay for. I ordered according to the size guide but it was not loose fitting. For under $10 it was worth it
2.0,It unraveled on first use.  It’s cute and I am going to try and see it.
2.0,"Cute and comfortable, but has a small hole near the shoulder. Of course already threw away the packaging so can’t return it now.<br />I don’t think lack of quality is worth this price."
2.0,"The black bag is fine. I lit supplies in it , however grey one<br />...label was missing so a. I wonder if this bag is new b. There was a scent which I had to clean /air out c. Threads coming off.<br /><br />Again black bag is great.<br /><br />This one.<br /><br />Not quite. Also one design flaw. The top handle is set up very strangely--across not from the two sides like normal bags and the clasps are flimsy (all of them). I had cheap and more expensive duffel.bags and while some of this bag is great such as pockets but the clasps and top handle need redesigning"
2.0,"UPDATE : Customer service was super nice , offered a refund and a new swimming suit that would fit ! Got my new one I picked a different style and size up && I absolutely love it!"
2.0,Would not stay together. They kept coming apart and the kids couldn't wear them for more then a few min.
2.0,"Not as alluring as the necklace very dainty looking.to small for my liking,but the necklace is really chunky and an appropriate size."
2.0,"Not true to size, extremely short and I'm only 5'5.  It's on its way back."
2.0,The color on the band started to peel away.  Not well made.
2.0,This was a cheaply made suit that lost a tassel the first time I tried it one. Disappointed in the looks of it. Returned without wearing it.
2.0,I was suppose to get A bracelet with it and I never did.
2.0,"These seem like nice enough boxer briefers however it may be a few years before my son will actually fit in them! He is 5 next month and his waist measures 21&#34; so I ordered a small using their chart. They are a few inches too big and immediately fall to the floor, I'm going to wash them but they aren't going to shrink that much! Disappointed."
2.0,Too small in some areas and too big other.  Not much stretch to fit.
2.0,"The shoe is ok, but definitely not oil or slip resistant!!"
2.0,"These are cute and my husband loved them. Unfortunately, he waited for too long to try them on. He is 6'1&#34; and wears a large in underwear. I bought these in XL to allow some extra room to move around. They are way too small and it's too late to return. Guess I have a new pair of pj pants."
2.0,"The imprint is screened poorly.  Also, the imprint is over the stitching in the hat.  It creates a blank space. Amazon arranged for a refund.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon."
2.0,Very thin fabric that shows every bump and panty line.  Then it stretches after a few hours and begins to slide off...while still showing every bump.  I wear it after my shower before I decide what to wear for the day on weekends.
2.0,I wore it once and lost a stone
2.0,Fabric is not a very good quality.  To thin for a winter robe
2.0,The Pendant is really beautiful but the smaller and golden heart is marked with &#34;MDN&#34; despite of it was not shown in pictures. The chain is too short. It would be very covenient the supplier exhibit all specs.
2.0,Fit strange Not flattering if you have a butt
2.0,"I'm a tall, shapely gal, these are high water. If you are tall and stick thin with no curve to your body whatsoever, maybe. Doubtful. I'm 5'9"" with a booty. Hard pass."
2.0,Nice product not the real offoos but will work nicely at the pool
2.0,Did not realize that it didn't lock when you pull it out.
2.0,"Little color stone not as seen in picture.  But, it is nice."
2.0,If imma pay 20$ for a face mask imma need it to look like the damn picture. 😒 why dose it have they eyes? its so awkward 😒
2.0,This had such potential. It came broken on one side with 3 of the 4 pearls inside the bag. I just fixed it since it’s just for Halloween but just not pleased. It also barely fits my phone. I have to put it in at a weird angle and it’s hard to get in and out.
2.0,fragile.... went to use one and it came apart within a few minutes.  Couldn't fix it because the metal attached to string feel off. Hoping the second one will try to last throughout the day.
2.0,This was way too small for my ears. I have average sized ears... :(
2.0,"These remind me of the spandex that I used to wear to drill team in high school. Not at all something I would wear to work. I would not categorize these as dress pants. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because though they were disappointing, from what I could tell without trying on they seemed to be pretty decent quality."
2.0,Hard not comfortable
2.0,I’m 5’7” 230 pounds and I wear 18 in jeans. I ordered XXL and they were about 3 sizes too small. Cute jeans though
2.0,"I am accustomed to sheath dresses not fitting me, but this one was laughable - the waist was much larger than the hips on the one I received. Not sure who they are cutting these for, but I returned it. The material was nice, crepey, but with no stretch at all. Might look good on someone who has minimal curves. For reference, my measurements are 36-26-39, and both the medium and small were way to small in the seat and way too large in the waist."
2.0,Asian size and it's  scratchy on me real cute but I'm returning
2.0,Ordered size medium to big needed small
2.0,"The size is smaller tan the picture of the hand with it. The chain is very poor and bad quality, and it is rusted."
2.0,Too long.  Color didn’t look like the picture more blue than black.  They were very inexpensive to purchase 🤷‍♀️
2.0,I wear this but won't buy another one because the skin has to be completely dry to put it on (can't out it on after taking<br />a shower) and the colors run and don't wash out.  Too expensive for color run.
2.0,"This watch “looks” really good but that is about all it has going for it. When you open the box you will be happy to see a beautiful looking watch, and soon as you touch it that happiness fades to disappointment with featherweight feeling of a cheap hallow band.<br /><br />The tool provided to remove links was an awesome thought, but it is useless. I was only able to get o e link out and the.plastic bent and broke trying to push the pins out of the next link.<br /><br />Lesson learned. I if you want a nice watch you have to spend $100-200"
2.0,So cute but CAME with holes in gloves.
2.0,Cute and vibrant colors with beautiful metallics. But I ordered a size 4 and it fits like 12-18m after a wash and dry. I’ll just give it to someone I know with a baby.
2.0,Very flimsy and vision is blurry looking through them. I would not recommend. I bought cheaper ones that were more well-made.
2.0,undersized
2.0,"the button on the side to adjust date and time is loose, on the first day I wore the watch at work, any minimal bump turned the dial button, so i had the wrong date and time all day and had to repeteadly adjust it"
2.0,This was too small for my petite frame!!
2.0,"This necklace is very large and heavy. And unfortunately, it looks cheap few stones came off. I really wanted to love it, but can't wear it anymore."
2.0,"I bought this for a hiking trip that I luckily didn't go on, because these fit so uncomfortably.  I tested them out while walking my dogs and they did not align with the arches of my feet at all.  Because I tested them outside, I didn't try to return them.  I'm hoping that getting some insoles will fix the issue, or else I wasted 50 bucks."
2.0,"Tight top, waist hit a odd place."
2.0,I loved the design of the nose ring but the ball kept falling off
2.0,Much smaller than expected but I can still wear it.
2.0,I returned this. It was too big on my wrist and I didn't like the gold clasp.
2.0,Cheap looking gabe it to someone that wanted it
2.0,"No yellow around the eye pattern, very cheap representation of what was advertised. It does the job of looking like a butterfly, but doesn't look like the pictures. I'm not happy with it."
2.0,Had to return it. I put it on and it was the first dress my husband looked at me in and said no. It is a beautiful picture online but if you are tall fair warning that it will make you look like a childlike porcelain doll. Unless you have a short and I mean smaller than 5'3 skinny body I would not recommend this dress. Something in the style makes you look like a little school girl. I ordered two sizes and both had the same issue.
2.0,"These boots look great & are well made. However, they are super slick on wet surfaces  - I bought them for our rainy Spring season & they are advertised as “rain boots”.  Also, be sure to wear the right socks because there is some ankle chaffing."
2.0,Expected an adjustable or a velcro strap. Not having to tie a knot with the strap to adjust!. And this was the luxury mask for the extra cost?
2.0,Arm length is great In XL but the quality is absolutely laughable. It arrived with three pom-poms loose in the bag. And I keep on losing pom poms as I shake it. Cheap. Beware!<br /><br />It’s very oversized but I ordered an xl
2.0,I bought these for my son . He is 10 years old they are a little to small but he will wear them just not his favorite
2.0,Sizing is very large the material also pills up and looks dingy. I may have work this a total of 3 times and it looks as though I have had it years
2.0,"Looked good, but my badge feel apart after 3 weeks..."
2.0,It feels like the area of focus from side to side is very narrow. For instance when looking at my computer screen I can not simply move my eye from one end of a line to the other I need to move my head and to look for the optimum focus point. It also seems like a small head movement makes it hard to find where I was looking before. For instance looking at a line on a screen then referencing a book on my desk takes longer than flipping a clip on pair down and has that out-of-focus queasy feeling.<br /><br />This may be normal in these kinds of glasses as I've never tried this type before. I also did not wait for the 1-week adjustment period. It seems like it would be too much trouble for what the glasses provide over changing pairs.
2.0,The picture is not the same product… the buckle is completely different when it arrived. It’s not a unisex belt either.
2.0,"This looked to be a great item - until I carried it for a couple of days.  The ring around the plunger just fell off!  It was there at the beginning of the day, and gone that night.  I didn't drop it, whack it, or hit it in any way.  I guess it just unscrewed.  Too bad.  It would have been a nice vial, if it didn't just fall apart..."
2.0,"Pretty earrings, and well made, however much larger in scale than I thought they would be based on photos. Too big for my typical style, so I’ll be returning."
2.0,"I really like the look of these glasses and got many compliments on them but they broke rather quickly.  Just a note, I am VERY careful with my sunglasses and have many pairs that are over 10 years old so I don't mishandle them."
2.0,Poorly made. Loose strings and knit so they will stretch out easily. Returned them.
2.0,the concept is great and I had been wanting this for a long time before I purchased it.. it does make putting charms on much easier but it is metal and when it slipped across my charm it scratched it... good idea but be careful; it can cause damage
2.0,"As others mentioned, sizing is way off. What should have been a size 5 for my middle finger fit more like a size 4. I could barely get it on, with the help of lotion. My bad because then I struggled to get it off, so painful. The sizing is inaccurate and it’s way too chunky for my liking. I’ll be returning it. Bummer because the actual design on the ring is really nice."
2.0,"Too small the color was not as pictured.  Normally a size 14/16 this XL fits like a 12 on me. I have wide hips but, I'm not &#34;heavy&#34;"
2.0,"The appearance of the shirt's screen shot looks so different fom the shirt I received.  I wanted a white shirt, but the shirt I received has dark-colored strips.  This is my first time buying shirts online, and will probably be my last.<br />Update:  The strpes on this shirt are very pronounced and<br />ugly.  Amazon needs to step up and send me the white shirt<br />I ordered."
2.0,Faded within a week of wearing them. I did not wear them in the shower or anything.
2.0,These are nice sunglasses but I have very high cheekbones and they did not fit me well so I had to return them.
2.0,Very cute but not true to size way to small for my son .
2.0,"The shirt design is cute; however it is very short and the material is that of a swimsuit...very odd. I have purchased a few other Allegra K items and have always been impressed, but this one was sadly just not up to par."
2.0,"These are super cute boots, but I did not find them comfortable.  The 3 inch heel with the hard sole was not wearable for me.  They also have slick bottoms, i.e. no treads.  I returned them because I knew I would rarely wear them due to comfort."
2.0,"What I got in the mail dose not look like the photo at all , it came with a small hole as well, the photo give you the idea it's a sweater dress and what's got in the mail is a stretchy thin woven shirt ..I'm mad."
2.0,I brought a 3x and it was extremely small
2.0,I was disappointed in this cardigan.  The colors were off and it had way more of a southwest look then I expected.  It was also shorter then it shows as well as ran small.
2.0,Salió muy pequeño el size
2.0,"I am not a big person at all, but these were clearly made for teeny tiny women or kids."
2.0,"This item looks good in the picture, but pictures can be deceiving.  Poor quality and dull color. I bought this for my husband.  He is average build.  So, be apprised, Gentlemen:  this barely fits my Lady Wrist. Most men would not be able to wear this and it's too crude for me to wear. Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,"The material is not what i expected, it seemed cheaply made. I returned it."
2.0,"It fits like a tight tank top, but I really don't feel any compression in th garment. I got this because I gained 40lbls over the last 6-7 months a due to medications.<br />I guess I was expecting the material to be similar to a tank top on top, but not just spandex on my stomache and waist.<br />This did nothing to help in me look better in my clothes or making my pants fit better.<br />I feel like if I lose about 10 more lbs on my diet, I'll throw them away."
2.0,This dress is good but chest is too large ....I wear 36c bra. but Soo it's too loose for me around that area. Feels like it fits good for Bra size 44/46 . And it's not a tight dress. Shape of the dress is straight fit not curve design.maybe that's it's 9$.
2.0,"Wanted a comfy sweatshirt…. This was NOT it. The description says “ Sweatshirt Material:Cotton Blend,Super Soft Comfy Breathable Fabric Halloween Sweatshirt.” NOT SOFT! NOT COMFY!!! It’s some weird material.  It’s thin and a little scratchy. I ordered an extra large but it fit like a med.  I really like the design on it but that’s about it."
2.0,The wrap didn't fit and I have smaller wrists.. The other two fit though. Good quality if I could wear it.
2.0,Glad I purchased these on sale as they were quite a disappointment.  Stones were loose in the settings making rattling sound; no light reflection whatsoever.  Waste of money.
2.0,"Returned. Nice plugs, but the edges are sharp and stab your ears when lying down on your sides."
2.0,Too thin and light.
2.0,"I expected less quality than the usual name brands but these were cheaper than the price.  The aviator lens is very thin and you can see, along the edge, where they applied the tinting.  These glasses are also surprisingly large.  If you have a small face, they don't work.  They are definitely lightweight and the frame is flexible."
2.0,i purchased these to have a fun pair of shades for the summer took them to the beach and upon leave the first day i noticed that the lenses were scratched. Now this could be because of the sand but if they scratch that easily that should be on the page when purchasing them. I have a pair of heart shaped glasses that look blurry because of the scratch. THANKS!
2.0,I was going to use these as septum rings but they are way to small and are abt the size of my pinky nail but they do look just like the picture
2.0,"way too small, cups are undersized."
2.0,"The earrings do not look the same as in the phone. Instead of a bright gold tone, they have an antique brass finish."
2.0,"It was just the wrong size, may have been fine...just not for me"
2.0,"contrary to other reviews : yes ! they look fantastic and people ask me : how much did you spend ?<br />Its nice attention, however ? The lenses rub clean very easily as well as the mirrored reflective coating they come with<br />they look great for a while however they are what they are, $10.00 sunglasses."
2.0,This one was even worse.  the black print is faded so bad.  There is no quality to these two bracelets I purchased from ChubbyChicoCharms.  I should have returned them both but of course that is an expense to me the consumer.  I would recommend not purchasing this one for sure.
2.0,My daughter wore the boots just three times before one of the pull-on handles tore right off. I messaged the seller and they told me Amazon would have to deal with it. There are no options to message Amazon.
2.0,The shorts are very light weight and comfy but the zippered pockets are ridiculous. Can’t even get my hand in them! If you plan on carrying your keys or phone don’t buy these.
2.0,battery did not work
2.0,Not nearly as cute as the picture. Kind of frumpy.
2.0,"It's beautiful from any angle but the bracelet is impossible to open,  the chain is very cheese you. Not a great purchase."
2.0,"Very sparkly but slides right off your head, the material is too silky.. I did wear it as a belt though but that's all I could do with it!"
2.0,"I wish I had returned these. The thumb holes are small, the furry bits at the top are too tight, the fur is *really* cheap and gross. For some reason I lost track of this package and didn’t find it again until after the return period had passed. So frustrating, these will never be worn and are just junk."
2.0,"Peeling off already out the package & most importantly, not symmetrical at all. Eyes are off, tusks are off, ears are off.. shown in 2nd picture"
2.0,The waist was tight and the shoulders too large.  Made in China-says it all.  Very disappointed!
2.0,Cute but disappointed because the larger open heart has a bubble in it.
2.0,Yellow short sleeve that looks more of a brown/gold is actually a Dijon mustard yellow. Not like the picture.
2.0,I just opened the camo mask and the strap is broken.  Can't  recommend the masks for quality. The only thing is there light weight.
2.0,I gave it to my daughter. She loved it!
2.0,"Fits perfect. However the material is very cheap. One of the belt loops tore right off that I had to sew it back on, just by putting my hand into my pocket a little too quick to yank out a phone. I feel like cargo shorts should be a little more durable than that."
2.0,I like the style of this case and the the leather quality but the zipper broke after one use.
2.0,This is not a traditional dolman top with a band at the bottom. It has ruching at the sides like a maternity top. Will be returning
2.0,"I wanted so badly to love this hoodie.<br />But, even sizing up it was too tight. And super long!<br />I purchased an xxl which fits more like a large.<br />It also went all the way down to my knees and the zipper on the sleeves is odd and uncomfortable.<br />The graphics are amazing though.<br />If you order and are tall and curvy, order at least 3 sizes larger."
2.0,Clasp broken when arrives
2.0,Its ok for a very young guy to wear. The bracelet runs  very small.
2.0,It is for small people you have to be about 95 lb in order to fit behind the blanket it's not designed for anybody normal or big
2.0,"The material feels cheap. The neckline is really high. In the photo, it appears to have a sweetheart neckline, but it’s not."
2.0,It’s a good hat and protects my child from the sun but it started to fray after one use!
2.0,"I ordered a 4, which is what my daughter usually wears, but these were huge. They also don't look and feel like a classic ballet slipper."
2.0,Too large and baggy
2.0,Disappointing craftsmanship. Corners not gracefully turned/looks a bit cheap.  Not bothering to return it...too busy; too much trouble; will no longer buy jewelry online.
2.0,The Ace 2 is specifically for younger children<br /><br />Bought this for my 6 year old who's original ace 2 band broke after a year. I like the extra loop on the band to keep it on but the actual holder for the fitbit itself came loose withing 2 days and the fitbit keeps falling out. Not great.
2.0,Quality not as good as I expected
2.0,Nice socks - but way too thin for my liking.  I prefer the regular thickness of the Darn Tough brand.  More material between me and the road.  I returned these and ordered the merino version.
2.0,"Product is different from visual and description. The shirt I received is a very shiny silky material and big.<br />The order took 2 weeks to get to me, and was shipped from China. Not even sure how I would return it, nor worth the headache of finding out for $9."
2.0,I would suggest buying one size up from what the sizing chart claims. I had to send them back because they were too small for my son even though I measured his foot according to the size chart directions.
2.0,Purchased the item for my wife but it was so small I had to give it to my 11-year-old daughter
2.0,"These socks are very soft, comfortable, and breathable. The quality is very poor. I wore them one time. Sent them through the wash and when they came out of the dryer the heel of the socks was falling a part on all 3 pairs."
2.0,"I ordered this necklace twice because I liked the picture so much. Both times it had white, green, and pink in the middle with different side markings. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I guess mine were defective but the silver things pointed at 45 degree angles and I coupsnt get them to pin straight down, so the the looked stupid and I wouldn’t wear them. If pointed straight down then they would have been great for the price. I got a refund."
2.0,The material is kinda nice. It doesn't look exactly like the picture but pretty close. I thought it was super cute. I was excited to try it on. The bottoms were really big and loose. The top has a tiny bit of push up but not enough. The top like fit weird and was kind of big as well but not as big as the bottoms. I don't have very big boobs or a very big butt so that's probably why. Overall the fit is big. I ordered a size small. I'm around the 5-5&#34;5 foot range and 100-110 pound range. I'm disappointed. I really liked it too. I most likely will be returning this.
2.0,The dress is nice and light but the sewing of the string that holds the dress comes off. The rubber string that is on the top part ripes off easily.
2.0,Within a week it start to change. Hate it.
2.0,Disappointed material is cheap and it came incredibly wrinkled I don’t like it at all. I should have returned it and never wore it
2.0,Great shirt color but it's already falling apart after 2 uses. It's already lost its shape and I followed the washing directions.
2.0,The charms are super huge and mine fell apart
2.0,Cute slippers and my son thought they were comfortable. He wore them in his pre-school classroom daily. They only lasted four months though before the sole started to peel away from the show.
2.0,"Had to return.  Basic shoe stretcher however when widening, the mechanism got off its track easily.  Not such a big problem but the reason I returned them was because they left dimples in the shoe at the ball of the foot.  Worth spending a bit more for better quality stretchers."
2.0,Loved the pendants but the chain was gaudy
2.0,Followed the size chart and it was still a size too small
2.0,May want to go two sizes up dress looks better in picture. This is a stretchy polyester type of material that did not fit.
2.0,Bought the biggest size to small definitely a junior and not senior size
2.0,Smaller then expected. ..No flow
2.0,Wayyyyy toooooo smalllll
2.0,The description is inaccurate... it clearly says that it should come in a bamboo tube mine came in a black nylon bag.
2.0,Their clothes run small (think Chinese size) and they charge for returns.
2.0,"Crystal is nice, but the dolphin really doesn't show up like it does in the picture.  Since you just get the look of the crystal, it wasn't to my taste so I am going to see if I can return it."
2.0,My daughter is 4 they were too large for her face I think they fit my face very disappointed she loves my little pony but didn’t like the mask were too big. I washed and dried them still oversized for a child a mask should fit snug for protection
2.0,The shorts are comfortable but they're like a window to my butt
2.0,This broke on the second wear. I would only buy this is you need it for one occasion.
2.0,"They are pretty looking but super big, didn’t fit my baby’s head"
2.0,"Nice style of apron with soft fabric.  However, I ordered the grey and under lighting it looks like a drab olive green.  Very disappointed in the color."
2.0,No me gusto muy pequeño
2.0,They didn't fit perfectly. ..but looks exactly as shown. They came before the delivery date specified. After trying on one it broke when trying to adjust the ring to fit my fingers
2.0,i followed the chart and were way too small. i didnt end up swapping for the next size up because i also thought they were not good enough quality to buy again. i returned for a refund.
2.0,shorts slide up when sitting
2.0,it doesn't hang well. the round moon falls behind the cresent as if you were wearing two necklaces on one chain.  the moon only truly glows under a black light.
2.0,"Didn't care for it to much, it was fleet then will, i send it back thanks any way"
2.0,"It’s a cute idea, but the clips are too small to properly fit on the window. This makes it difficult for the antlers to stay in place when you need to roll the window up and down for whatever reason. Plan on keeping your window shut for the entire season.<br /><br />The nose came with a giant gap in the seam, I had to sew it back together.<br /><br />One of the antlers snapped in half from the first drive after installation :(<br /><br />Overall, I’m pretty disappointed."
2.0,This cute necklace came and the bee looked scary and not what was expected
2.0,a cheap price produces a cheap product
2.0,hat too big i wear a 6 7/8 need to return
2.0,These are not multi-dimensional molded plastic. They are thin recyclable material that is a flat donut with a picture of frosting and sprinkles glued on the top of the donut. Cheap!
2.0,"I love how it looks, but it keeps pretty terrible time. I wore it all day for a week and was constantly losing minutes. I'm not a very sedentary person, and I've worn an automatic watch before, so I know how to work them. Overall, I'm disappointed, because I really liked how this one looked."
2.0,"Ok design, but I thought it was smaller. Also, product too heavy when you wear it."
2.0,These arrived slightly bent and very dull looking. Very disappointed.
2.0,Too small for pregnant women!
2.0,Will have to return this item as actual size is definitely smaller than shown via size chart. Don't think trying largest size will work. Color was also very different shade than requested. Material crinkles easily.
2.0,Not at all what I was thinking it was and it took forever to get this Hawaiian shirt ....
2.0,They are long and very itchy to me.
2.0,"Cute design, average price, but the sizing runs at least one if not two sizes too small! I'll probably end up giving it away because I can't wear it. Ordered an XL because I wear a L or XL in other tees and tops without issues."
2.0,I expected from the style for it to be a little more of a fitted stretch material. All in all the shirt is well made just not what I expected and isn’t as flattering as I had hoped. It’s a cross between a standard T-shirt and a girls baby doll tee if that makes sense. Wasn’t very thrilled with the style sending back. If your a fan of a standard T-shirt and don’t want shape it’s for you.
2.0,this watch is not rose colored....it is gold....I LOVED the face though
2.0,Nice hat but is a big fit.
2.0,"While its a very cute belt, the buckle does not work all the time. I was a little disappointed."
2.0,They look nice but the straps are very tight so that makes them uncomfortable 😔
2.0,"I got this for my daughters Halloween costume and they are really cute in person and fit her great but they wore out really quick.  The shiny part started to wear out during our trick or treating and spots started to show where the shine was coming off.  Also, after a little while of wearing these my daughter got really really hot.  Of course this Halloween wasn't as cold as it normally is otherwise I don't think she woulda been as hot.  Now she refuses to wear them because she was sweating so badly in them."
2.0,"Decent, I guess."
2.0,"It does look like the picture, but it is sooo tiny, I cannot get the drawstring waist over my boobs -<br />the waist is fixed and tiny<br />I read the too small comment and ordered the 3x - it is barely a size 10 if that in normal sizes,,,,"
2.0,I am a 0-2 and ordered a medium and the bottoms are SO tight.
2.0,This does not hold a rubber band to save my life. Shortly after it went in the trash - it will hold a rubber band and then as soon as you start moving your arm it flicks off. So unless you're going to stand like a manikin all day - I wouldn't recommend this product.
2.0,"Good backpack, but the straps are the way the backpack closes. Once the straps are pulled out to a certain link, it is impossible to make them stay shorter for get long."
2.0,doesnt look like picture
2.0,Cheap material. Did not fit as expected.
2.0,Cute but balls don’t stay on the end. Perfect for something that won’t stretch or if you can glue on ball.
2.0,Normally I love this jewelry but 2 days after getting this the sprint or what it is that holds the latch on the neckless closed came out so now I am scared to wear it fear I might lose it.
2.0,"I initially ordered this lovely chain in the 16&#34; length. I was sent a 14 inch version that happened to be 13 inches long. I measured it against a ruler so not only was it too small it was literally a choker. I have 16&#34; chains here at home and it was over 3 inches short, so I sent it back. I am ordering it double and triple verified as a 16 inch again since it is the light and delicate chain I want but I am extremely concerned that if I do I'll get a 13 &#34; or a 25 or a 17&#34; length instead. My hope is that I can get an accurate length and not some random length.Again, the chain is lovely, shining and delicate so if AMAZON can get the length correct to me I should be OK....."
2.0,"I thought they were cute, but a wee-bit overpriced and smaller then they look.  The hooks are different, and more of a copper look then what is shown in the picture."
2.0,I really like the height and the design of the shoe but unfortunately after about 10 wears it's already breaking and when the shoe came it was about a half of a size too big. For this much money I should have gotten more than 10 wears. I didn't buy these thinking they were disposable but that's pretty much what's happening right now. Not real happy about it.
2.0,"Can't predict how good the product line is, as the LOL fit seems to vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Comments from purchasers are truly necessary."
2.0,The quality is very nice. The picture however is very misleading. Mine are extremely dark. Have a chip in mine and I didn't drop them. Its nice for the pricing. But the color is very dark.
2.0,Cute top but did not like the fit
2.0,"Not at all as pictured, the hoodie is just a glildan hoodie, the iron on is very faded and looks very worn. I contacted the seller and I must say, they were extremely nice and apologetic. Very disappointed in the hoodie but have to give the customer service 5 stars!"
2.0,"These are way too small, unless they're expected to stretch really tightly, which would not be comfortable. They are also not breathable and feel almost... sweaty?... to wear. The return window closed the day I had my baby, so I didn't have the chance to realize they weren't comfortable and return on time. I would NOT recommend these to any nursing mother. Stick with a cotton blend!"
2.0,"After just a couple of weeks of wear, the band is losing the red coloring."
2.0,Got the grey/beige and it is definitely yellow and grey.  Not pretty at all and feels cheap. I regret ordering it....
2.0,Loved these bracelets the first time.- they were a good 1/2 inch longer this thin and unwearable! Too bad... they made cute little gifts!
2.0,This jacket runs at least 2 sizes too small. Very frustrating.
2.0,Not true to size at all! Runs extremely small!
2.0,"Somewhat snug fitting, but my main complaint was that they left black marks on my hardwood floor everywhere.  Had to return them."
2.0,They were too big... did not feel like a good fit.  Wrote to seller several days ago.  Still no response.
2.0,"Not supportive at all if you are larger chested. I am 36ddd (ordered) XL. It fits,  but cant do anything in them except lounge. No support, not high impact at all."
2.0,"Bottoms of slippers are very slick when used to walk on hardwood floors.  They also run large, so order one size smaller than you normally wear.<br /><br />No problem walking on carpet"
2.0,"As much as I LOVE the statement this handbag makes and the compliments I get when I have it draped around me in the local grocery store, it’s not durable.  The interior pockets come apart.  I actually took scissors to all of it because it was a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I love the look of the purse, but it’s far from sturdy.  I can’t believe I spend so much money on it.  Ducti needs to get their act together."
2.0,Very tight on child's head and no way to adjust that tightness.
2.0,it does not fit the way it should.
2.0,I am a girl - I ordered an XLarge.  I have an old Russell - just about falling apart - loved it.  Wore it for years.  It was an XL but not extra tall.  The new one came with a tag saying XL-XT.  I am so mad - now I have to return it and get another one.  Maybe Large or Medium.  I don't want one that goes down to my thigh and sleeve that is too long.  Why Amazon does talk about that in their description of Russell Sweatshirts is beyond me!  Not nice - not fair - not true!!!
2.0,Not made well used once and it's already falling apart
2.0,Too snug of a fit.  Not the best quality.
2.0,Love the watch but it came with some markings on it already.  It's on the clasp and that's usually the first place that a watch shows wear. It's a gift for my husband so I will see what he thinks of it. Nicole D.
2.0,"I've had earrings like this before, I prefer the look of this type of hoop in my second piercings. I wasn't impressed with these at all. The metal bent far too easily and was nearly impossible to get back into the right shape so that they would clasp. I wore them for a while but since taking them off the first time, I haven't wanted to hassle with putting them back on."
2.0,"Very disappointed in the quality of this necklace.  It looks great, but once my daughter (4 y/o) had it, it broke and the design quickly faded.  Returned it.  If your child plans to not touch the &#34;gem&#34; and be very careful with it, it will do."
2.0,Too Long and tends to pill after a few washes.
2.0,Beautiful watch but with in 2 weeks it started running super slow.. and did not have enought time to return.
2.0,Nice coat after getting the right size. Wasn't happy with there cancellation after my first attempt to purchase. Wasn't happy with return policy.<br /> The review show's extra large. I received a medium.
2.0,I think it's time our friends across the ocean educate themselves on REAL AMERICAN SIZES!!!  I'm so upset I can't wear these...:(
2.0,Too tight/too small for Bigger busted ladies.
2.0,"Too tight, size up! Cute though!"
2.0,Small but good quality
2.0,Wasn’t like the picture. Weird fit. Nice material though.
2.0,Having a replaceable filter was a great option unfortunately there is no pocket to hold the filter in the mask it just rests between your face and the mask. Mask seems well made but I would not have made the purchase knowing there was no way to secure the filter In the mask.
2.0,"Super thin material, looks & feels very cheap, not sweatshirt material at all"
2.0,Should have went to Halloween store and bought same for $5 broke before Trick or Treating
2.0,"Very skimpy, crop shirt tight at chest and shows Alot of cleavage. Better for thin small chested women. It is a cute shirt, wish it was longer on top and bottom. For reference I'm a size LG shirt and C cup."
2.0,Beautiful ring but the same one is on Wish.com which I ordered and it turned my finger green after wearing it about a week. Disappointment. Never getting any that says &#34;plated&#34; again. Wish I could find this style in a sterling silver or stainless steel but haven't yet.
2.0,Update.(6-26-17)..lasted almost a month then one of pieces came off the arm. When i tried to put it back on a small part of it broke off and now it keeps popping off every time I put the glasses on . (Note i have only worn these about a dozen times since purchase)<br /><br />I am usually very picky about my sunglasses but I bought these on a wim because I liked the lenses. I only wear these now.
2.0,Slips around on my foot too much to be useful for yoga
2.0,H U G E!! Way too big
2.0,"Only one of the septum rings fit well, the plain silver hoop and the hoop with 3 gems on it did not fit they were to small and to tight on my nose I had issues getting it out."
2.0,I regret buying this.. its thin and faded. probably use for a dust cloth. very disappointed.. pic not the same in person. I usally am very satisfied with product sold here but not this time.
2.0,Very beautiful and nice. Was a little smaller then expected but still nice. It is a bit loose and moves around on my wrist even on the smallest setting. The energy of this piece feels quite nice.<br /><br />Update: after wearing fit a few months on and off the copper color faded and looks terrible and shortly after that the entire thing cane apart super disappointing.<br /><br />Tried to contact seller a few times but never heard back
2.0,arrived with one of the gold ends broken and a hole in the fabric
2.0,Bigger than expected. It's like an amulet around your neck. Considering return.
2.0,"This ring looks dainty and small in the picture but in reality is HUGE and clunky. Just thought you might like to know. If you want a small, delicate, sweet ring this is not that."
2.0,Poor fit despite adjusting order with the size chart. Obviously designed for short thin body types. Quite disappointed.
2.0,Shirt didn't fit evenly. Top smaller than bottom
2.0,"The socks themselves are attractive and comfortable as long as I’m sitting down or using my feet for ambulatory activities. However, once I’m up on my feet and moving four or five steps into my day, these demonic socks slither hellwards and bunch up under the arches. I live in a country that has a dearth of park benches or other objects upon which to place my feet, right, then left, to fish my socks out of my shoes as is necessary every 10 meters. No, I would not buy these again, and I’m sad that I did the first time, but I wear size 15 shoes and have never had colorful socks in all my adult life. If this is how things are, I don’t believe I’ve missed out on much."
2.0,"Cute, but the seams are itchy and it's smelly."
2.0,Dress was waaaaay too small
2.0,Nice dress but I'm short and the waist line of the skirt somehow was right under my bust making them look bigger and making me look out of proportion.
2.0,"The clasps were so tight I broke my fingernail trying to open.  Also, came from overseas I would prefer to buy in USA."
2.0,Too small<br />Looks better on photo
2.0,Didn’t really like the product.
2.0,One of the lenses were cracked where the screw attaches and i don't know if I got a defective pair or if it's the color I chose (smoke lens) but they distort my vision.
2.0,"Hi there, I know it's, me aging the customer,<br /># positive really fast shipping didn't pay for!!<br />But it came with a cost. An it's a big one. Yes I know there a cute badge. But I ordered them expected too be a 100 percent. On point. I need them for my wedding this week coming up. An for our photographer, so in all you get what you pay for.<br /><br />P.s. be handy with the glue gun."
2.0,Ordered 2 and gems fell out of both.
2.0,Too big.. also painted metal- not at all elegant - paint gives a plastic feel. Not even worth the $4 paid
2.0,Not by low quality
2.0,"Fits as expected, the colors shown on the amazon site are not what you’ll receive... I actually returned the shirt because of this. I needed those colors to pop with a Halloween costume. And they don’t at all."
2.0,"I bought a brand-new Fitbit so I decided to buy a band to go with it. I did my research and I thought this band was the most beautiful and had appeared to be sturdy. When it came I was very pleased. Install was very easy. Adjustment to a smaller size was easy. Once that was done, the links continued to open and the bracelet would fall off. The third time it happened with just movement of slamming a door…it did not catch on anything. The next time it happened I was not even aware the clasp opened and the watch fell off until I found it on the ground in front of my car. Again upon inspection one of the links opened up. What I did was change the link as they are adjustable. In the end it was not enough and it came apart again and this time it was lost. I cannot in good faith recommend this band to anybody. As beautiful as it is, it’s useless if it gets to the point where you have to keep looking to make sure The clasp stays closed and it stays on"
2.0,"I do not like the fit of these leggings. I thought they were similar to another pair of RBX leggings I currently own but they aren't. For me, this pairs tummy flattening panel hits too high and is uncomfortable. I would return them but I already trashed the tags."
2.0,"Very cute but very thin fabric and runs VERY small! I ordered a size 5 for my 2 year old niece and it will just fit her. Also, shipped from China and took almost a month to get it so I had to give it significantly late for her birthday."
2.0,""". . .SIZE 2 and SIZE 3 is smaller ,pls select one size bigger as usual!"" ~quote from the description.<br />Yes, a good part of the blame is on me because I didn't fully read the description. This also shouldn't be lumped in with how pretty the shoes are. Since my daughter is a size 2 I felt this deserved it's own bullet point. I also don't buy one size larger as usual, BECAUSE I WANT THE SHOES TO FIT HER."
2.0,"Disappointed, this supposed to be 70% cotton but when arrived you can see the material clearly is not. Cheap stretchy material."
2.0,"I got the small blue space dye (full length) leggings. The material (space dye) doesn't have the stretch ability of the plain material does.  These leggings were very tight at the calf/leg opening and I couldn't really get this up on the thighs and butt because the just wouldn't stretch. I bought two other plain pair (one Capri length and one full length) that each have great stretch and fit very well. All of these were the same ""small"" size. Returned the space dyed pair for refund."
2.0,"I ordered 2T-3T. This is larger than all of the 2 and 3 I have in my house! This thing is ridiculous. I gave it two stars because it's adorable, I'm ordering the lower size if they have it, but holy heck this is huge. Update: I just received the 0 to 6 months in the mail today as well and it in no way would fit a newborn. It literally snugly fits my toddler. I'm keeping it two stars because it's absolutely adorable and it's such a shame that I can't use it but it's just way unbelievably huge"
2.0,"If you get a cotton, nail stick and remover, this will be the same or better. Waste or money!"
2.0,A cheap zipper used twice the zipper broke
2.0,"Too small, not the best fabric, clingy.<br />."
2.0,The material feels weird and the feet are huge.
2.0,"It is vinyl, not gel like I thought it was"
2.0,Flimsy chain broke shortly after I placed it around my wife's neck.
2.0,It has think straps which are hard to undue. It feels flumpy when wearing and being a small framed person with a chest the fabric digs into my armpits. It just isnt comfortable.
2.0,"Got this as a gift. Niece really like it, except for the fact that the chain broke the very first day."
2.0,Fell apart. Try gorilla glue to make your earrings; you'll have better luck keeping the backs on.
2.0,"After going through the reviews, I decided to buy this dress for a summer wedding I’ll be attending.<br />I received it today and it is very much see through. The quality looks like a beach swimming suit cover up. Very cheap looking! Also came very wrinkled!"
2.0,I thought the waffle would be a textured piece of yellow plastic. It is only a picture of a waffle placed under a cheap clear film. It is very hard to see and does not look like a waffle.
2.0,"While the watch looks pretty, it is so heavy, it actually digs into my wrist. Very little “ wood” on this watch, metal and as mentioned, uncomfortable. I waited to long to return it. I own many interesting wood watches, this one is a great paperweight, and can double as a small anchor for a boat."
2.0,The ones I thought I  I were getting were the punk ones in the picture.  But they needed having unicorns all over them.
2.0,"If you want to wear this as a mask, that material is way too thin. If you're talking & you breath in, the material will go into your mouth (awkward!)."
2.0,Daughter loved this but me not so much. You get what you pay for. While my daughter thought it was soft and comfortable it was not durable. Oddly shaped and fell apart after 3 washes. Granted it was cheap but I had higher expectations of lasting more than 3 washes.
2.0,"I like the color. The front is too wide, back is too narrow. Not what I expected. I like the width to be the same all the way around. Not my style."
2.0,The only reason this gets two stars is because its a cool design and a solidly made hat. That said... the sizes run extremely small.
2.0,I received the wrong glasses. I ordered tortoise frames and recurved teal frames with wire arms. The glasses were much smaller frames than pictured which threw off the overall look. Very light weight and cheaply made. I would not recommend.
2.0,"The item looked great on the computer however, the quality is poor I think it is not worth the price will not recommend it"
2.0,"While the quality looks great, the sizing is VERY small.  My 7 year old is very thin for his age.  He wears size 6 t shirts.  I ordered an 8 in this rash guard, hoping it would be a bit roomy but it was very very snug.  I'm reordering in a size 12!"
2.0,"I am pretty annoyed. I have worn these pants exactly ONE time and there is already a noticeable tear in the crotch area. I've requested a replacement, but I am seriously mad that I have to return this pair when I just bought them. Especially during these times when I really do not want to leave my house. I am hoping the seller responds soon to my complaint."
2.0,"[[ASIN:B0716C6F67 Apple Watch Band 38mm Women - PEAK ZHANG Black Genuine Leather Replacement Wrist Strap with Gold Adapter and Buckle for Iwatch Series 2,Series 1,Sport,Edition]]<br /><br />The description clearly states &#34;gold adapter and buckle&#34;  What I received had a &#34;silver buckle&#34;  I ordered the same product from a different seller & again got a silver buckle.  The adapter is indeed gold which matches the gold apple watch.  And I like the quality of the black strap.  It is just really a shame the buckle doesn't match and because of that I can't give more than two stars."
2.0,band is not jean material...
2.0,"It won't stay on my shoulders, and is wide through the waist, with arms that are just slightly too short."
2.0,I ordered the turquoise bracelet.  These beads have no tones of turquoise to them.  Unfortunately this was meant to be a gift & I will be l not receive a replacement in time.
2.0,"It's a tint on glass with a reflective side, making it incredibly hard to see and even less so to drive. It's worth paying a little extra on a nicer pair."
2.0,"I Like the color and pattern of the shirt but the overall fitment is off and the material of the shirt feels rough and cheap. Fitment was big at the bottom and small at the top around the chest and arms. Not sure if I will wear again but I will keep it as a shirt I can paint in or get dirty in.<br />I feel the shirt should be cheaper in price as the price does not reflect the quality and feel of this button-up. As for longevity of the shirt, I cant comment on as I only wore it twice in the 3 or 4 months Ive own it."
2.0,"The turquoise has no marbling or grain, resembles plastic.  The white pearls are too white and look like plastic."
2.0,"Disappointed in this purchase. I have a 40in waist. Bought the 4XL. Waist fit is fine. The crotch is too low and too tight, limiting movement. Saddle padding is just in the way and never in the correct position. I anticipate this could really be a hindrance on longer rides. Shorts are designed poorly for biking. However, construction and materials seem to be reasonably good for the price. Material weight is ideal for summer riding."
2.0,"This was not as pictured. The material was thin, see through, and stretchy"
2.0,Masks ran too<br />Big for a boy. Fit grown man
2.0,I ordered a small though I'm a medium built n close to 5.8. On receiving it looks big n cheaply made. Had to return for a refund .
2.0,"This is cute in theory. The embroidery is quite unique and that is what drew me to it in picture. The quality of the item when it arrived is beyond low. The material is like that of one-ply toilet paper, thin and scratchy. The straps that tie a the shoulder are poorly secured, I wouldn't even attempt to put it on a moving baby. There is no snaps or button on the bottom for an easy diaper change, so that's a no-no. Finally, the material is poorly stitched with inappropriate thread that the seams had gaping holes from thread going through (again thin material). This is going back and I don't recommend it."
2.0,Nice color and material but weird waistband
2.0,The material is very hot to wear in the summer.  I thought it was a summer dress.  And the fit is somewhat small.
2.0,Looks like it does in the picture but the material is really odd and way too stretchy. It didn't help lift at all. Just aired out my butt cheeks and I fot a size under what was recommended.
2.0,Does not fit. Obscures buttons.
2.0,Wish they were bigger. They will not fit over my necklace hardware.
2.0,Bracelet broke within two hours
2.0,Frame came apart the first time it was worn
2.0,"poorly made, thought it would he like a real sports bra, but its not."
2.0,I like the concept but it dumps soap at random. I Can't for the life of me explain the activation.
2.0,I've tried it on once. The fabric is smooth and I know it will be cool as the seasons change to hot. I will definitely need to remove the tassels. Not a good fashion element at all. It may be too long and one of the decorative rows at the bottom will have to go. Another case of a too long tunic that I thought I would never reach. Time to try the tights and booties.
2.0,"Too small. I'm 6'4"" 200lbs. They are tight and the pockets are backwards."
2.0,These run smaller than other leggings I have bought. They’re also super thin and don’t go up as high as I would like.
2.0,"So cute, but was a little to tight on my legs"
2.0,"Parecen de buena calidad, sin embargo debo agregar que se dobla la liga de la cintura, cuando uno se sienta,  quedando incómodo, no es lo que esperaba."
2.0,"Good god this hat is ugly in navy blue. When my boyfriend saw it he said &#34;oh honey...&#34; and not in an impressed way. It is cheap, cheap, cheap. Two stars for keeping the sun out of my face (theoretically--I wouldn't actually wear this outside.)"
2.0,There is literally no way to clasp this belt. The latch is a large metal button and it doesn't work. My boyfriend uses it still by tying it in a knot but I can't use it.
2.0,Happy meal toy quality and nothing but glare from light reflecting off your face when you wear them
2.0,This is light weight and runs very small
2.0,"This shirt is huge. I’m usually a medium in women’s shirts and this medium is more like a men’s large. Also, the color of the lips are not as vibrant as shown in the photo."
2.0,Beautiful design but made small
2.0,"very comfy material, but i ordered a medium and it runs a little small, when the large comes available i will reorder but size up, i like my sleepwear to be roomy so maybe its me"
2.0,"Love the case but the neck strap came apart after just 2 weeks. A big disappointment, as I had to buy something else right away to replace this one."
2.0,These are really adorable but sadly the back on one Of the earrings was bent and it seems they’ve been very easily otherwise they are adorable
2.0,Smaller than size indicated.
2.0,The pearl is beautiful but the string kit really the knot got loose and I am not able to ware it.<br />As I was putting it on one of the knots untangled
2.0,"Tho the color is nice (grass green) this wallet is way too big , it's almost as big as my purse which is a backpack purse. The dimensions are incorrect on the webpage. I measured the one I got and it's 8.5"" tall x 4.5"" wide.  I want one I can easily fit inside my hoodie front pocket but still long enough to hold my google cell phone. I have found a different one on Amazon that I will get after I return this one."
2.0,"Nice material, hole in seam at the front, disapointed"
2.0,"No era lo que esperaba, pensaba que la tela estiraba."
2.0,Stone fell out after 1 week
2.0,Sheer and cheap.
2.0,"I like these tank tops a little, but way too tight in the armpit area. Would not recommend or buy again."
2.0,"This product is a great concept. However, three cups do not stay on well, and the strings can be seen through most of my summer dresses. It wasn’t worth the cost."
2.0,Most were nice. But the black and purple ones were all defective. All four seemed to have been made with a wrong yarn or something. They had 0 stretch so there was no way possible to put them on your foot. Too bad.
2.0,there was no return label to get a refund
2.0,"I ordered this in my normal size, but it was very oversized.  The material was also super stretchy and hung like it was to ""heavy"".  I did like the color and the pockets, it just wasn't flattering on my body type."
2.0,"Material and everything from the design and sewing is amazing, though it was pretty small. Gave it to the kid instead."
2.0,These are really cute. The only thing is the material pills. If you hand wash it wash on gentle you make get a better result. I wouldn't tumble dry either. Customer service was outstanding!!
2.0,I took a chance ordering this dress despite some of the negative reviews. Unfortunately I also felt negatively about it. I am a thin 5'5&#34; and this dress just didn't fit right.  The shoulders are odd and tight.  It's a wrap dress but with too much fabric yet the slit exposes too much leg when you walk.  The fabric also is a cotton blend or something and not a flowy chiffon.  Looked cheap.  I had to return it.
2.0,Returned for refund- too small
2.0,"This visor is a pretty color - my favorite color to be specific.  It looks very nice in person.<br /><br />However, this visor arrived damaged - bent out of shape.  The packaging wasn't damaged but the visor was messed  up - might have been the delivery person just shoving it in the mailbox.  I am uncertain.<br /><br />Additionally, the visor had a lot of sticky residue all over the brim and along one of the sides.  I couldn't do anything to get it off.  I tried scrapping/ripping it off - tried soaking it - even tried throwing the visor into the washing machine.  None of these methods allowed me to peel off the sticky residue.  My visor arrived with a 2nd black visor I bought and nothing that could spill out and cause the residue issue.<br /><br />Due to the defective shape and irremovable sticky residue I just ended up throwing this out.  Currently I would recommend against purchasing this visor.<br /><br />If the packaging was sufficient and the residue wasn't all over the visor - I would have given this 4 or 5 stars.  It really is a beautiful color."
2.0,"I didn't have high hopes for this item, but it really let me down. Super sheer, short, and smaller size than expected."
2.0,"Nice work dress, but runs small and fit is too tight for a professional environment. I am 5'4&#34;, 135# and ordered a medium."
2.0,does not fit true to size. an XL is more like a Med.
2.0,"It was very cute, but turtle broke off after first time wearing."
2.0,"The coating wears out quickly. I've been wearing this for about 2 months and the band is not coated anymore. I love the design but the quality is not there. I bought another ring that was $9.99 that's lasted me years, but not this one."
2.0,A lot shorter than it seems.
2.0,"Poorly made, strap attachment wasn't even sewn all he way on."
2.0,Kind of an awkward dress but I'll get used to it... Like the fabric and pockets
2.0,"You get what you pay for, and I thought this jewelry looked cheap. I ended up donating it to the thrift shop."
2.0,"The first time I wore this dress, I really liked it.  It's casual and comfortable.  However, after wearing it only once, the fabric became very pilly.  I wore it a few more times as just a bathing suit cover up but the pilling became so bad that I had to throw it out.  Really disappointed.  Total waste of money."
2.0,"Sooooo, I am 34-26-36, 5'9&#34;. I am an athletic built. The waist part was a bit large, the bottom part was a bit tight. And I don't even have that much of a butt.<br /><br />The cup liners it comes with are literally these cut out cirles... You will have to change the liners, it makes it look very cheap or not very grade A . Overall size dimensions are correct just not very propositional dimensions on body. Forever 21 suit looks better on me than this"
2.0,"Cheap , gas station sunglasses"
2.0,This top is so cheap looking and way to small!!!! Sent back!
2.0,"Wore is one weekend & it has already come undone, spilling beads everywhere"
2.0,"I weight 173 normally I wear a med or large. I needed a XL, due to stomach area."
2.0,These don’t stay on my daughter glasses. They stretched out and are now too loose.
2.0,"Wore it to my wedding, but lost 6 clear stones and one opal before my honeymoon was over.  #cheap"
2.0,Doesn't generate enough light to illuminate everything in my bag. Waste of money.
2.0,"I am 6' 2"" tall with a 37' waste and a 36"" sleeve.<br />With the vast majority of jackets I am an XL and the body is slightly large, but the shoulders and sleeves are great.  Sometimes a Large Long works.<br />It almost feels like Klim is making fun of Americans with their US sizing.<br />The XL sleeves are way too short the shoulders are a little constraining and the body would fit if I were nine months pregnant and I just swallowed a watermelon .<br /><br />I am not built like a linebacker and I am not in great shape, yet Klim thinks I should wear a XXL in the shoulder and sleeves with a medium in torso.<br /><br />I know very few people these jackets would fit."
2.0,I gave them all to my daughter.  I wear a 1X or 2X  but these weren't X at all.  Buyer beware.
2.0,I had to refund these because they do not even stay on my belly button for 1 second. They are cheaply made and will fall off so easily. Do not recommend this product. Very disappointed
2.0,"The sweater is a acrylic, not a soft sweater. It was unbeatable. Runs on the small side NOT oversized at all. It is a really bad sweater. Order from a different brand, I did and was super happy with their version of this Free People dupe. Do NOT order this one!"
2.0,"Definitely smaller than I thought. Looks great, has a weird smell to it but again very small."
2.0,It's nice but I didn't like that the colored bands are painted.
2.0,"A very cool looking peace of jewelry. I ordered two of these but only received one. Very disappointed. If you do receive the item, it’s nice."
2.0,"I am someone who is happy with a pair of pants as long as it covers my butt, but boy were these a mistake to buy.<br />The fabric feels like it could tear at any second (and not just where it's already torn). It feels very cheap; it's almost like wearing thick paper on your legs - stiff and easy to rip. The button is loose and moves around freely - like if I pulled just a tad bit too hard to get the pants undone, it would fall off. There is little to no stretch on these ""Stretch Pants"".<br />Amazon has tons and tons of ripped jegging options, and you would honestly be much better off spending maybe 5 dollars more on an actually decent pair. I'd pass on this one."
2.0,These pants are too thin & see through & come up entirely too high. I’m only 5’ & these came up way past my stomach.
2.0,"The band is gorgeous and real leather and I love it!<br /><br />BUT, after a few weeks of wear, I started itching and feeling miserable.<br /><br />Then saw that every bit that's metal was rubbing away to reveal a duller grey metal underneath.... I'm going to assume it's all plated metal and the rest is cheap nickel based metal.<br /><br />I use to make jewelry and I am allergic to a lot of metals so I know a fair amount when it comes to this.<br />I had to put clear nail polish on it just to wear it the last couple nights until replacement bands could arrive. They are much uglier, but no metal involved.<br /><br />Tried getting a picture but the clear nail polish on it made it hard to get a good one of the wear. I will try to remember to add pictures to this later.<br /><br />If you aren't allergic to any metals, this band is gonna be amazing for you. Buy it!<br />I wish I didn't have these sensitivities!<br /><br />If you are allergic, don't bother. You'll just be sad in a few weeks."
2.0,"They worked great for the first couple months, but then battery life went, and they began rusting, and several died.  losing about one or two a month at this rate. I do not recommend this unless you’re into disposable lights"
2.0,"It is way better than the picture, I was stunned. I only got it because it was on sale but It is so gorgeous and goes with a lot of different accessories. Definitely getting all colors.<br /><br />Update: I loved it so much I ordered one in the 6 and it’s way thinner than the one I ordered previous and has a rounded side instead of cornered and tarnished.<br />The first one I got was perfect, I don’t understand why going up one size should look drastically different. Took off 3 stars because I was expecting the same product not a different style ring."
2.0,"It's an okay dress. It would look better at my natural waist line. The hardware for the straps in back is a tacky looking: big, white<br />and plastic. The red color is<br /> gorgeous."
2.0,I wore these for a few weeks before they got a hole right on the seam. I've worn these leggings for years but the last two pair that I've bought have holes in them within a few weeks of wearing them regularly. The seams have loose threads so it doesn't take long for them to tear. I'm really disappointed in these because I love this brand. I can't return them because the window closed over a week ago.
2.0,"The swimsuit holds up well after being washed. But, I do not dry my swimwear. I'm giving this swimsuit 2 stars because one of the strings on the side of the swim bottom was missing! Instead of dealing with a return, I decided to just take the string out. While wearing this for the first time at the beach, the liners in the top of the swimsuit would not stay in place. Plus, the swim bottom was loose on top, where the band is. I figured it was me who made the band loose by taking the string out, but knowing how to sew, I made my own strings and added them in, and the band was still loose. I ordered a medium, which I normally am. I also added more stitches in the bra top to keep the liners from slipping. It is a nice swimsuit and it's cute, but I shouldn't have to tweak a swimsuit."
2.0,However the material of the black skirt is poor it keepa stretching and transparent
2.0,REALLY HARD TO PUT ON AND IT IS A TWO PERSON BRACELET FOR A KID I HAVE SMALL WRIST BUT THIS IS NOT FOR ME<br />DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT
2.0,Quality was good craftsmanship was good but two sizes too small
2.0,"Pictured a much larger stone, this is extremely small for a adult.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"Overpriced for the quality of inflatable version of this pillow.  The concept is great but it does slip off your shoulder no matter what I do.  Maybe a strap of sorts should help hold it in place.  If space isn't an issue for you, I would prob go for the stuffed version and try that instead."
2.0,Has a weird band in the middle if you are tall it will work but I am short so it
2.0,"these shoes run large and do not hold to the feet well, especially not when walking on a sandy/muddy beach. also the sole is too thin, so walking on pebbles or shells on the beach hurts."
2.0,As described but hinge is very loose. Opens frequently throughout the day.
2.0,Dress is beautiful but tight under the arms ..
2.0,Necklace looks very cheaply made in person
2.0,Comfortable but bad quality. Don't buy.
2.0,Came as pictured and correct dimensions. Great gift!
2.0,"What I received is flat, with not enough feathers. And what feathers there are were bent. The feather colors are dull, not at all like the bright vivid colors in the example. Save your money."
2.0,It was very baggy and didn't fit well for a smaller chested woman.
2.0,This charm is very pretty but with in the first 2 weeks 2 stones fell out. Guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Too small and the neck fits poorly; it gaps.
2.0,These did not improve color level very much for me. Some slight improvement in some colors and not others. I also found that outside use was all they could be used for as they were too dark for inside use of computer and watching TV. In the end I returned them because I could not justify the high cost against such a small improvement and limited area of use.
2.0,Runs very small.  Fabric is thin and scratchy.
2.0,"... this shirt just did not do it for me at all.  The material feels like it's made from a cheap table cloth and it's very tight around the neck.  It's a pity as if they had made this from a softer material, it would have looked and felt great.  As it is, you feel like you're actually working a buffet at a restaurant that doesn't want to pay to have their uniforms clean, so they prefer you to hose off.  That's how plasticy this feels.  I actually feel guilty about putting this in the donation bin as I feel I should apologise to anyone who tries to wear it."
2.0,These are so cute! But after a washes them they got weird and little fuzzies. They won’t be able to wear them long term. Won’t buy again.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. First of all, I thought it was too small. I am 5'7.5"" and 130 lbs and I could get it wrapped around with no problem, but I felt the bust area was way too small. I do not have a large bust and even so, I felt it was not wrapped enough at the top and too revealing. The material is super thin as well. It also came up to the middle of my shins so more of a midi dress than a maxi dress. It is a great price if you don't mind sacrificing quality. I returned."
2.0,"I ordered one size bigger than I normally wear. I measured all the places necessary. My measurements should have fit the size I ordered, but it did not fit my chest at all.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because it is a pretty dress. The color was true and the stitching was well done."
2.0,i received these earrings in a tool bag!! they were not even in a box... the backs of them were loose so i had to buy new backs and the metal used to create these pretty little things is so crappy that simply placing them in your ear makes them bend!!!! They may look great here online but they are definitely not worth your time or your money!!!!!!!
2.0,It was to large
2.0,"dont really fit great, this is one of those product that you shouldn't get online"
2.0,The material is heavy and strange (think Activewear type but heavy and bulky). Does not hang like expected based on pictures.
2.0,I think this style of tops works best with smaller bust sizes
2.0,"Dress was beautiful, however it RIPPED while I was at a fundraiser right below the zipper. Thankfully I could place my purse behind my back so everyone didn’t see my behind!! Beyond disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Used it twice. Shrank after washing and drying. Very hard to put on. A lot of effort to close the snaps. Not worth buying.
2.0,"I was very hopeful for this product. But upon receiving it, I was very quickly dissatisfied. The wallet feels like a leather-fabric wrapped around cardboard, with uneven stitching all around.<br />Even at this price point, I can't imagine this wallet lasting through everyday use."
2.0,Straps very bad. Bag is nice but straps made it look cheap
2.0,"Very small circumstance. Not Stainless Steel for sure, an inferior metal. I am glad I already got a refund. Hard to use, not what the description says."
2.0,"this bra is beautiful, but you have to have NO sag for the band not to work its way up over the breasts. Perhaps a tighter band, or larger cups would have worked, but since I am a d cup I was advised to get a 36 &#34; band, even though I am 34 d. there are no cup size options. I am very disappointed, because it is a very pretty bra and seemed comfortable when I first put it on."
2.0,"It's a nice skirt, but the fabric is not to my liking"
2.0,It is pretty but runs very small...
2.0,It came in pink not white. Too late for event I was going to wear it to.
2.0,Definite no ladies crutch too long .... materual not the best
2.0,"Very comfortable blouse, nicely made and flattering to the figure. Unfortunately, after the first washing the blouses fabric dye proved to be unstable, causing blotches and decolorization throughout the fabric."
2.0,Not easy to put on. Lost one first time wearing
2.0,"Wow is this short!<br />Fits great in the waist but the length is<br />Ridiculous. If I bend over, 😳😳😳🤭"
2.0,IT WOULD NOT STAY CLOSED.
2.0,"sent it back, small and the neckline was messed up."
2.0,"These look pretty nice, but only in the box. My biggest complaint is the back closure. There are 4 hooks which are impossible to close. The front is also a problem... There's just way too much fabric from the top of the cups to the shoulders. This creates a huge gap above the breasts. Also, the overall size was too large. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'7, 130# and am a full 34C"
2.0,"The print is backwards. The zipper teeth are warped, so zipper does not work. We had to hold it together with safety pins. Material feels like a plastic tablecloth. Overall, not worth the price. This is a quality I'd expect from a $15 costume at Walmart during Halloween."
2.0,Quality is very poor. I bought this for my husband a few months ago and there are already tons of unraveling strings and of course this is something he uses every day. I don't know how he could be handling it more gentl. It will be unusable by the end of the year.
2.0,"I usually wear us xl. This plus size is too small, it doesn't fit me at all."
2.0,"So they are super cute, but if your nipples arent super tiny these aren't for you. They also took almost a month and a half to get to me which was annoying but hey they're coming straight from China, I'm sure."
2.0,Broke the first time my daughter wore it.  Not excellent quality.  But it's super cute - I'm going to try and fix it.
2.0,"There different then the picture above. Yes they are black, but not the same. I was so excited for them & they are ugly in my opinion."
2.0,I’m going to see if the creases/dents/folded areas matter to my son when he gets it tomorrow. I may need to return as defective
2.0,Son estrechas
2.0,It was a wrinkled mess !!  I probably will wear around the house...if at all.  I do not like the material at all & it’s not a true royal blue....but I will not bother to return because it wasn’t very expensive.  I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase !!!
2.0,Took almost a month to come in and there was a hole in the mesh when they got to me
2.0,This top came with a weird smell.The sweater is ok but it’s cheaply made.I got a md but need a small
2.0,"Pros good clamp and cup holder design, but the swivel to adjust position is poorly thought out. No resistance in it and when riding any bumps cause your beverage to turn and even fall out."
2.0,The fit was way to small. Did not like it
2.0,I ordered my husband a 4X and it looks like an extra large because it fits me great definitely don’t order for bigger men it is very comfy to wear though but it is super thin
2.0,Looses time
2.0,"In theory, these pjs should be awesome and super cozy. In actuality, they are ginormous! Even trying to go by the chart and examples of sizes, I ended up having to return these. I'm not sure why the length of them had to increase so much just because a larger size was needed for bust. Certainly not everyone that wears an XL in clothes is 6ft tall! I was hoping they'd be a perfect gift for my mother to help keep her warm during the winter months, but they just didn't work at all."
2.0,"Order up for sure. I normally wear an XL in coats and ordered this in XL, and I couldn't  even get this on. The arms were too tight, and no way I could have zippered it closed. I was bummed because it seemed like it would be a nice, warm coat for those rainy, cold, but not full winter coat days, and for playing outside with the kids. I didn't bother to order another one."
2.0,"I thought it would be more like areal sock, but they are very thin.  I also thought it would come up a bit more on the toes, but they don't"
2.0,"Ordered a large, they are closer to small/medium. The material is not very stretchy, and when I tried them on some of the stitching ripped. They feel cheaply made, and I’ve never had leggings made from this particular blend of polyester and spandex. They feel kind of strange on the skin; they’re not soft. I will definitely be returning these."
2.0,"These look nice on but they squeeze my head above my ears so bad it is so comfortable and painful to wear. Also the strip that goes above the nose leaves a line on my skin after wearing that is sort of embarrassing. I am always pulling them away from my face to try to prevent this. Overall, nice look but not great to wear for various reasons. Would not buy again."
2.0,One earing turned greenish?
2.0,"Cheap hat, looks like true hat in the picture, got a trucker hat instead. This is not a baseball/sports hat--its a cheap trucker hat."
2.0,Item not as advertised
2.0,Very hard for my 3 yr old to put on - not very kid friendly the way they fold.
2.0,This shirt is so cute til you put it on. The arms are all stupid and sewn up weirdly so they are floppy on one side.
2.0,"So disappointed. I returned for a smaller size and it fits GREAT. BUT numerous seams were coming undone and within 2 hours of wearing it, I already have a hole in it. Very cheaply made. Not even worth returning AGAIN.<br /><br />For size reference: I ordered the XL (US 6-8). I’m 5’7, 184 lbs."
2.0,To large in the wrist band.
2.0,"This shirt definitely runs small to size!  I am a size medium and per other reviews I went up and order a size XL.  The shirt sits short on me, definitely not able to tuck it in like the girl in the picture shows!<br />Also, the threading on both sleeve cuffs and on the bottom front have long twisted thread tails.  I don't want to cut them for fear of the shirt just coming unraveled and they're quite unattactive when the sleeves are folding up.  Even when all the way down and buttoned around my wrists you can see them hanging.  We will see how this shirt hold up after a couple of washes!"
2.0,It is not the same as shown in the picture.
2.0,"These seem to be the most comfortable masks I've found for my kids. They are very thin, so if you are a mask believer and really want to do a good job filtering, look elsewhere.  The problem is that they are very stinky. I bought 4 masks and all of them had a chemical smell. I soaked in cold water with a lot of baking soda and they seem better but I'm not sure what the kids will say after wearing them for 6 hours at school.<br />UPDATE: After about 3 months the seams are coming out of about half of the 8 or so masks that I ordered. Considering the cost for such a tiny amount of fabric, and the super simple design of a tube, these should hold up better than they are. Downgrading to 2 stars."
2.0,too big sent back
2.0,Had it less then 4 months and it broke today !
2.0,"These pants are not accurately sized as depicted. If curvy, I would order 2 sizes up. The material is lightweight."
2.0,Color is clearly brown not black and smells like mildew
2.0,No for full figure ladies but soft material
2.0,"This is the same quality you would expect if you bought a full character cosplay off of a company that mass produces them-- except those full costumes also cost about $30 and often come with pants/shirts/shirt/accessories.<br /><br />Though I couldn't find a better alternative, so I guess these have the monopoly."
2.0,"Lightweight? Yes. Fit though, it was tight around my thighs, pretty much fitting like compression shorts. I ordered the XXL size as my waist size is a 44. The waist band fit normal but the shorts themselves, were tight on my thighs. The pockets? Rendered useless due to the fit. I would’ve loved them but the tight fit was a big disappointment."
2.0,Way too small in the bust area.
2.0,"This runs pretty big and the straps are not adjustable.  I’m 110lbs, 32B bra and I was just drowning in the size Small.  The material is nice, as well as the lace.  If they made it in an extra small perhaps I would have kept it.  I think its a very generous size small as well. So if your petite like me, don’t bother getting it !"
2.0,"Buckle is great on this belt, but it is very, very small and the elastic part of the belt is thin and does not stretch very far.  Price was great but the big thing is the size - really for a very tiny lady or young girl."
2.0,"Sent back. See thru. Disappointed as I needed something this style for a summer staple in my wardrobe, but there is no way I would feel comfortable wearing this running errands or to work."
2.0,"Es un vestido hermoso, me lo puse una sola vez. A la primera lavada se empezó a deshilachar por todas partes, no recomiendo esta compra."
2.0,I'm a size small and this falls off my shoulder and looking like I have a roll all the way around my hips. a inner tube.
2.0,"They arrived fast and were comfortable, very easy to pull on (other reviewers have said they have to wiggle into them but they are super easy to pull on). They are NOT boot cut. They are very VERY wide thru the entire leg. Honestly just like my big comfy pajama pants. I had to return."
2.0,Inexpensive earrings that look it
2.0,"My son loves these, he got the space ones. However, after only a few days they started to fall apart. They are coming unglued from the plastic piece that inserts into the croc."
2.0,"These are advertised as for kids. I bought them for my 3,4, and 5 year old grandchildren. They are very tight on their heads before wrapping the ties around. The ties were barely long enough to wrap around twice and I had to tie the 5 year old behind her head. These are cute. I definitely would not buy them again. I really wish the reviews were more accurate so I wouldn’t have to go through the headache of ordering more 😩😩 no I won’t be returning them as that’s a headache as well. Also these are difficult to wear with braids and yes they have simple styles a ponytail with 7 braids going down the back, 2 ponytails and 8 cornrow braids to the side. Again I would not recommend these for braided hair, it’s difficult to maneuver the braids under the bonnet. I’m giving a detailed review so others may be informed before buying. UPDATE!!!!! THESE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT STAY ON THE ENTIRE NIGHT."
2.0,Need to return<br />Not happy
2.0,I love this dress but for a 3x which I am nowhere near this size. It should have been much larger on me. I can barely breathe in it. I am hoping to get through my 1 night event without it tearing.
2.0,The quality of the metal is good but mine came with missing stones
2.0,"Not a fan of the fabric on these, they are supposed to be cooling, but do the opposite for me. Pair of thieves soft underwear is much better, I would go that route instead."
2.0,"it is asian size, so it is very small and it does not strech. looks beautiful if you are very skinny."
2.0,"The adhesive didn't last a day. The concept is good, but even with stepping on the bottom part, the heel pads end up flopping out of the shoe."
2.0,"Almost couldn't get them on my feet. I wear a size 8 and got the 9 to 11 size pack. Also, wore my first pair today and got a hole in the heel and the toe. Really bummed about this purchase."
2.0,Compré un M y L y los Estados financieros  don demasiados grandes
2.0,"You get what you pay for here, extremely cheap gold coating. Very matte, not shiny at all"
2.0,The colors looks faded or pre-wash...
2.0,"the top itself is really cute. looks just like the picture but it is definitely not for everyone. I am pretty petite, usually a size small 32B and I could barely get the top buttoned and when it was buttoned it was unfalteringly fitted and uncomfortable. there is no give to the fabric, no stretch so making it uncomfortable to breath and uncomfortable under my arms."
2.0,There was no bulk to this at all. It was not as promised.
2.0,The material was great. The cut is great too. It is just that the size was was way smaller than a large.
2.0,"I'm a pretty average size.  Petite s/m and wear regular and petite s/m knee lengths coats all the time.  This coat just fit weird.  It was massive on top in the chest area and really tight around the thighs.  Like it tapered in.  If you have a Johnny Bravo shape this coat could work for you.  Also, the top buttons don't have button holes which was annoying."
2.0,Not the look I was expecting.
2.0,they do not work well
2.0,"Nice band at first but it broke within 2 weeks, the part that broke was non repairable."
2.0,"The arms are extremely tight. Looks super bulky, and unforgiving on."
2.0,"Material is super thin , the arms are not full as shown in picture. Might wear it as a swimsuit coverup MAYBE"
2.0,Got this for our 3Y old. Didn't survive even 3 weeks - pink coating started chipping off! Poor quality. Not getting this again!
2.0,Just another piece of loose cloth posing as a type of 95 mask. Waste of money and endangers your health. A piece of kleenex over face would have same benefit-- and you could blow your nose when finished!
2.0,"They're  hard to click together when in your nose. The guage size was right, and they looked good while they lasted. I got these today and already broke the silver and the black hinges while trying to click them in placw."
2.0,Top is extremely small ... have no idea how this came together as a set
2.0,petite size
2.0,"[edit, March 23, 2014]<br />The many five-star reviews of this terrible loupe call into question the perception of the average person, even the average loupe buying person. This has distorted optics, making it very hard to use. The magnification is about 7x or 8x, and MOST DEFINITELY IS NOT 30X! Someone should report this to Amazon, because this is simply a lie. It even says 30x on the product itself, but set it side by side with a high-quality 10x loupe, and you'll see that it isn't even as powerful as 10x. You'll also see that a high-quality product is so easy to use, but this is a LOW QUALITY product, making it very, very hard to use it well. My original review says the rest; I haven't changed my position except to find it very weird that such a little piece of junk can get as many 5 star ratings as one that is of the highest quality. That doesn't even make sense. Do they pay people to write these reviews or something?<br />[/edit]<br /><br />Original review follows:<br /><br />There are many aspects of a loupe which you can rate or compare. The size, weight, construction, materials, and most importantly the magnification, clarity and non-distortion. This loupe basically fails on many accounts.<br /><br />Pro: the lens is glass, the rest is stainless steel. It's compact and has a nice weight in the hand.<br /><br />Con: The viewable glass is ¾ inch in diameter. That's a small loupe. The image is warped and wavy. The magnification is not even 10x, much less 30x.<br /><br />Amazon sells several very fine loupes. It's hard to see through the comments, so I bought 9 different loupes from Amazon recently, some quite expensive, and compared them. This was the worst of the ones I bought. There are probably others worse than this, but I didn't get every kind. I avoided the all-plastic construction and went for glass and metal. Anyway, you can do better than this, and it's definitely worth spending a little more money to get one with a clear, non-wavy image. (by the way, Loupes are not meant to be held high above the subject matter. Hold them down fairly low for the least distortion.)"
2.0,Wore it for a bit and now it won't stay tight
2.0,No se entregò en su caja original . Acostumbro comprarlas y vienen en su caja original. Es una cartera muy costosa para empacarla en una caja que no es la suya. Muy mal!
2.0,"Dress was very very short, It was much bigger than expected and definitely not as long as the picture advertised. Not a typical maxi length, it looked really bad."
2.0,Make sure you order a size bigger
2.0,These pants fit super cute but cheaply made.  So if you work out in them they will run like cheap nylons. They are not squat proof either... I guess you can say you get what you pay for but I have ordered other workout pants on amazon within this price range and they did not run. I did really like the way they looked so I returned the size small ( my size ) for one size up ( to a medium) keeping my fingered cross they dont run this time. Also I recommend wearing a sweatshirt around your waist while and when doing squats... hope this helps :)
2.0,"Way too small, not enough coverage, poorly made, hard to tie the top. Will be returning"
2.0,"Super soft but the padding is too small and you can see it through the fabric. The straps are also way too long. Not for you if your body type is not tall, thin, and chest-Less."
2.0,"This blouse ran a little small. The sleeves are shorter than I expected. It's supposed to be long sleeve, not quarter sleeve. Material and buttons are nice."
2.0,"It was a little bit bigger than I had thought it would be, and the top button is like a 1/2 inch below the top of the shirt … it does show it in the picture I just didn’t catch it"
2.0,These look and feel a whole lot cheaper than the images lead you to believe. They’re comfortable at first but have worn down super quickly and aren’t holding up well at all after less than a month of use. They are total lint magnets (mine have attracted every piece of my dog’s fur) and get dirty really quickly.
2.0,"The product was a bit big and I purchased one size smaller than usual per comments. The black bleed soooo bad. I haven't been able to wear it because straight out the bag, my hands were dyed black. Still trying to figure out what to do with the short set. I have washed it and it is still bleeding black."
2.0,"This product feels like a costume dress, and does not justify the price. It's extremely thin and doesn't lay flat on the back lace. The trim is super sloppy, just stay away."
2.0,If u have a bigger bum..the back skirt sets higher ..not a good look!
2.0,"Three pairs of these footies have ripped at the toe seam since I got them; ordered in March, first wore them with Easter outfit. I have used the laundry bag as suggested and everything. Two pairs disconnected at the seam before ever washing them too. I am pretty disappointed. They are very cute with my heels at work as I do not like to wear any shoe without a sock or a footie."
2.0,"Very low quality yarn but I do have to say that the sweater is comfy, my family fights over mine so I got them each one."
2.0,There are excess items such as rubber that were not removed and so my feet got hurt.<br /><br />It is good if not for the excess rubber. It also fits well as described.
2.0,These have a weird way of unscrewing themselves. Two somehow managed to unscrew themselves and fell out randomly! I didn’t notice they fell out until the end of the day. Strange! I’ve never had this problem with any other belly ring before.
2.0,"I have such mixed feelings. They are very comfy and the shorts are cute, but the top is not cute at all. They are also an odd material and it is so soft but are sooo heavy and hot. The shorts are a bit small but still a good fit but the top could have for two of me!"
2.0,"Definitely not the size it says, and the material was a disappointment. Not good!"
2.0,I like it just dont  Right the moments are right I don't think the crystals are real
2.0,I returned the item because the material was scratchy and not comfortable.
2.0,"I normally wear a large but did not want it to fit tight, so I ordered an XL and there was no way I could wear it.  Sent it back."
2.0,It's the actual size as shown
2.0,Low quality unfortunately. Disappointing.
2.0,Crown not fixable. Deformed. Sadly.
2.0,"Lindo, como en la foto, pero muy frágil.  Hace ruido cuando lo abrís y cerrás. No es práctico para un niño que usa lentes todo el día."
2.0,"Charm is obviously not a charm suitable for a pandora bracelet as it is too large.  Very disappointed at the size.  The appearance is nice, just to large."
2.0,Doesn’t look exactly like what the picture looks like.
2.0,"Bag is heavy even with nothing in it. My 15 inch laptop fits but just barely. I have to stuff it in there. The strap doesnt hold weight, the bag looks deformed because of where the strap is located and the distribution of weight in the bag. It Is roomy and you can fit many other items. I would not recommend anyone buy this bag, the price does not match the experience obtained. I've only used it about 5-6 times. Now it just sits in my closet."
2.0,"Very thin material but it looks nice, it’s just a very, very thin cotton material...  Unbelievable thin!!!"
2.0,"This look cool but the part that goes through your ears is too big to fit a normal piercing. If you do not have gages, i do not recommend."
2.0,Boots look great however they are slightly small compared to normal Nike sizing. Their soles are extremely hard and uncomfortable. Very little ankle support. I couldn’t imagine trying to work (LE) in these.
2.0,"Does not absorb sweat,  its polyester,  stitching pokes arms and legs. Does not flatter your figure. makes you look old and fat. Not great."
2.0,"the palm is over an inch too short (from fingers to wrist).  the heel of my hand comes close to the bottom of the glove.  this glove in xl seems to be made for a person with a huge fat hand, long fingers, and almost no palm to speak of."
2.0,I liked them but had to return them. They sent me the wrong magnification for reading glasses. I will Ofer again at a future date.
2.0,"After reading all the reviews, I thought these would be a winner- not so.  The size I almost always wear pinched my toes.  I also found the sole to be hard, and there wasn't enough arch support for me."
2.0,"Cute top, I’d suggest wearing it over a long sleeve shirt. The material is a bit itchy, even after several washes."
2.0,"I was looking forward to these gloves, unfortunately I had to return them, they had a hole in the seem."
2.0,"I bought these for children ages 2, 8, and 10, knowing they were adult sizes; but to use for Halloween accessories to costumes.  The prints are really pretty but I have not washed them yet.  The tiger print came with what appears to be a seam rip, but once I looked closer, the “glued” seam was not sealed.  I did not know socks could be glued instead of sewn.  I will probably return these even though my children really want them to play in.  I cannot see paying $20.00 for socks that fall apart before they have been worn at least a few times."
2.0,"I regret this purchase. Waste of money. Super cute for my toddler who LOVES tractors, but this literally fell apart the second time he wore it!! Very disappointed."
2.0,"Died within minutes of opening the package. Nice big, easy to read dial."
2.0,"And a REALLY strange tag on the side of them that says ""Fashion Design STYLE WITHOUT THE the specifics and tries to be extrsordinsry.....""<br /><br />So not only does it make ZERO sense but it is also misspelled.  There is ZERO chance I will put these on my son unless I can get that tag off.  There is also a fake looking button on the front and weird orange tags with red stitching."
2.0,Tarnishes after one wear
2.0,"Sleeve was so short, I love the fabric and the style but unfortunately the short sleeve made me return it"
2.0,"It fits really weird in the shoulders, and the color was way lighter that the picture."
2.0,THE ZIPPER KEPT COMING OFF THE TRACK SEVERAL TIMES.  SAT THROUGH AN OUTSIDE CONCERT IN POURING RAIN AND THE JACKET WAS NOT WATERPROOF.  I CAN'T RETURN IT SINCE THIS ITEM IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.
2.0,"the size is too small, I would chose a size larger next time."
2.0,"This is ugly, bad quality, I would only wear this around the house and wouldn't be worried about messing it up. Would not buy again."
2.0,"I purposely ordered a rose gold necklace because I do not like yellow gold, and this quickly faded from rose gold to yellow gold. Other than that it was a beautiful necklace."
2.0,"I bought a few moissanite rings on Amazon to compare. Compared to another ring labeled color GH, this one is visibly darker/more brown. Additionally, moissanite is supposed to test positive on diamond testers, and this one tested negative. I still give 2 stars because it does look pretty. It comes in a nice box as well."
2.0,Very clingy.  If you don't have a pudgy midriff it might fit better.  Color very pretty and the style is nice for a thinner person.  I'm a 3xl.
2.0,This shirt is NOT long enough for a XXL Male!! (6’0” only)
2.0,"Fabric was not quite what I expected.  What I really didn't like is edges were simply surged.  Did not look good.  Maybe good for jeans, but did not look dressy."
2.0,"Cute, but no strap. Daughter can’t carry it.  Disappointed."
2.0,Very strange...hard to tell what shoe is the left and what shoe is the right. Daughter wore them one time and the eyelet fell out. It did its purpose for the 4th of July
2.0,I have a earlier one so wanted to up grade so bought same size well was a size smaller but tag said same size so returned it
2.0,"These socks are for like a womens size 5 shoe. It was pretty ridiculous. The foot part is just not long enough for the typical person. The best compression socks i've bought so far have been Dr. Motion.. but I love a bargain.. unfortunately, you get what you pay for with these."
2.0,"The picture is deceiving. The fabric isn't &#34;heathered&#34;  like it looks in this picture. This picture also looks like a sweater style knit, but what I got is a plain long sleeve t-shirt with a thin screenprint looking design on the sleeves. I checked the size chart before I ordered a medium because I wanted it to be baggy enough to wear over a tank or tshirt. Well, it's very baggy and just too big for me to wear. I contacted the company about returning it the day I received it in the mail and they told me to check the size chart on their website and they wouldn't return it. No, &#34;I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. Let's see what we can do to get you the right size.&#34; Just a big no, so won't be ordering from them again."
2.0,It fits bigger than its counterpart black color and is a very bright red.
2.0,Too narrow at toe so returned it. Cute style.
2.0,"So for seven bucks, I'll be keeping. But the product is cheap, thin, smaller than 8 inches (advertised), and the colors are painted on and smeared in some cases. Very low quality. But whatever you need them for, they may be fine. I just use them to wrap around journals. Meh. Wouldn't recommend for higher use."
2.0,These are not seamless. You can definitely see a seen when wearing white.
2.0,"LOVED the bracelets, but the one with the lava stones broke within a few weeks."
2.0,Cute- But fits really oddly. It was both too loose and very high cut in the crotch.<br />Fit well everywhere else but far too revealing to be worn in public. We are returning it.
2.0,"I received a discount code voucher in order to purchase this women's firm control shapewear waist trainer for review, giving my honest opinion. I am a little disappointed. The fit was fine, but the product is not of great quality. The plastic &#34;boning&#34; was already bending out of shape from trying it on. It is very hard to get on. The upper part folds over and peels away during wear if you sit. There is no opening to go to the bathroom. Most of these types of things have a clip in that area so you can go to the bathroom. This product you have to remove all the way, which with how hard it is to put on this is not an ideal issue to have."
2.0,"They have some runs in them.  Hard to explain, but you can see runs in the &#34;paint,&#34; if you will.  It distorts vision, so clarity isn't the greates.  The red lenses look more yellow and both lenses are pretty dark.  Worth the money, but having runny paint wasn't worth it for me.  I find myself wearing a different pair of shades these days."
2.0,I should have ordered a lager size.
2.0,Ugly..... when I got it I was super disappointed...
2.0,Really liked the style of this Cycle Jersey. Was returned due to faulty zipper.
2.0,"I usually have my slippers for a couple of years.  These are already worn through. The stuffing is coming out of the bottom. The fake fur on the inside came out in clumps. The bottom on one shoe is detaching from the rest of the slipper.  The tops still look good, and the color is not faded, they just didn’t have any quality."
2.0,was disappointed as the size was about 2 x's smaller than listed.  Luckily I was able to gift it to someone else.
2.0,"I purchased these slippers in late July, 2018. The stitching began to come out almost immediately that holds the tongue on the slipper. I used various methods to secure the stitching because they were only $23 slippers. Figured you get what you pay for, but then after 4 months the rubber sole is completely separating from the slipper, which is going to render these useless. Pay a little more and get something else. Or know that these will only last you roughly 4 months. You decide."
2.0,The first time I wore them they fitted great. After I started wearing them they stretched out on the stomach area and got extremely tight in the crotch area.
2.0,Stays folded with creases. Hard to make like picture
2.0,Did not receive the suit pictured. fit was all wrong; color was wrong and does not have the cute tassel ties. the straps on the suit pop off as soon as you put it on. would NOT recommend for purchase
2.0,They weren't what I expected. The fabric was too much like plastic.
2.0,"This product is extremely thin and light, in fact you can see through it and easily blow out a candle. It also had a funny smell. It is very comfortable but it got hot really fast. I am very skeptical that this would be very protective."
2.0,Cute bracelets for the price. Tarnished & turned a weird maroon color after wearing only once.
2.0,"The frames are flimsy and the nose pieces aren't adjustable. Two of the lenses on two different pairs already chipped after only a few weeks. Since I only got a three pack, I'm down to only one pair of unchipped lenses..."
2.0,The Plus size isn't a Plus size! Too small.
2.0,Not as pretty as the picture.  Waistline was too high.
2.0,I ordered three of these bras and the lace has came undone on every single one. I do not dry in the dryer to prevent this and it still happened. Will not be purchasing again. I purchased in April and this happened the beginning of June.
2.0,It was kinda faded looking
2.0,Fits ok. Using as base for Halloween costume. Kind of makes me look like a sister wife.
2.0,Expected it to be a little bigger.
2.0,"Was pretty for about 5 hours until the fabric gave out, it’s super thin and flimsy."
2.0,i got 2xl its basically just large. fabrics reallly really cheap and itchy i hope it gets better but it wasnt worth the money. im happy with the design but thats it
2.0,Incredibly tight and small.
2.0,No good for large breasted.
2.0,Seem great but to small narrow and length.
2.0,Or ordered a m and package said m but tag said xl. Feels basically like the top of pantyhose only as a shaper. Fit a little bigger than I was hoping and not exactly a &#34;shaper&#34; but did what I needed it to do
2.0,"Title claims seamless, arrived with seams."
2.0,"The placket looks like it was randomly sewn on as an after thought. The edges are unstitched, so I assume will unravel. I washed it 3 times, and could not remove creases. I finally ironed it, and came out ok."
2.0,Did not get the ones I asked for they work well but get foggy
2.0,"it is narrow and long, the pattern is blurry and the fabric feels cheap, I wish I hadn't ordered it."
2.0,"It's okay, but definitely not the loose fit they say it is. I even orders 2 sizes larger on purpose. So I wear it once in a while, but not the cute piece I thought it would be."
2.0,"I have these and red, which I really like, but in pink, they use this cheap spandex-like material for the colored parts. Which I don’t think looks cute."
2.0,"Quick delivery, but the color has faded already."
2.0,"It was surprisingly long to me. I consider myself short at 5'3&#34;, so I don't know. Got a small, considered it long. May the odds forever be in your favor."
2.0,You have to lace these up yourself.
2.0,"Dress runs very small, ordered a large. It should be swimming on me, instead it is very tight. I like my clothing very loose"
2.0,Not only do they fog up they cause my glasses to fog up and the plastic cracks easy
2.0,The right leg was considerably shorter than the left on the first skort I ordered. Given the option to just exchange it for another I was excited to receive the skort I've really been wanting. So disappointed with the same problem with the second skort. Will not be ordering from this company again.
2.0,Not happy. Wasn't  a true size. Husband wears a XXL. Brought a XXL. Fit too snug. I was happy with the delivery time. Recieved it the day of the party.
2.0,"Cute dress that fits really well! I really liked it, however, after one wash, the stitching around the neck came undone. I tried to restitch it but failed. I'm really upset with how soon it fell apart."
2.0,"I like the adjustable straps, but the white is definitely not white. I'm wearing this today with a white cardigan and it just looks dirty."
2.0,"They didn't stay on for me. I tried four times and couldn't keep one on for more than a day.  There's another design that's like a spring you wind around the ring that I will try next.  No problems with the seller, just the product didn't work for me."
2.0,It was so cute . I loved it until I dropped it the very next day and it broke . I am so upset
2.0,"Shirt is actually hot pink in color, not red as it’s reflected in the picture. The sort has a sheen quality to it. However the quality appears to be nice.<br /><br />Size is true to regular US sizing.<br /><br />Because of the color I will be returning."
2.0,"Three shirt package and even though ""Small"" each one had a different sizing. One had a neck that was much larger than the other two and and none of the three were fitted but larger than the proportions on the models in the pictures."
2.0,I really wanted to change my industrial bar. Ordered these and none of them fit. They were too small.
2.0,The material is not as pictured.  It is very patterned and looks cheap
2.0,"I wear this watch at times, but it is a lot bigger on my wrist than I expected. The face of the watch is much bigger than the leather. One of the gold buttons had popped off, so it is not very durable either."
2.0,"I went by the sizing chart provided and ordered an XL. I had to laugh when I pulled it out of the package as it was very small. My size 6 teenage daughter fit into it perfectly! So buyer beware, the sizing is wacky."
2.0,Bodice is not fitted! Makes you look very Frumpy. Just to be clear this is the one with a zipper
2.0,"Too Big, I sent these back."
2.0,"seller delivered on time, good condition.  I just didn't like the fact they have no shine to them, and color is dull."
2.0,"I do like the bag for some reason that it is a good size and the handles are great for travel. It is washable and looks good. But, the quality of bag is so poor. Within a month, almost most of the inner liner came apart, even of the small pockets. The bag fits 13 inch laptop (macbook pro 2016), but not in the tablet pocket. Actually the tablet pocket is not very useful and actually takes up space."
2.0,This was a beautiful piece however I wore it for two days and it tarnished and turned my ear green. I am returning it.
2.0,"This came promptly and was very pretty.  I really loved the design.  However, after only a couple weeks it started to change to a brassy color.  It was cheap, do I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Zipper poor quality outfit a lot smaller than said d
2.0,"This back pack has fallen apart since day one.  It started with the attachments (little bear pins, etc), not losing the pins, but the little pins falling apart. Then one of the two zippers came off the track with no way to fix it, then the back pack started ripping apart at the top.  The straps wouldn't stay tightened until we tied knots into them.  So not even 1 semester into school, and it's garbage now.  The tote works somewhat, and the lunchbox are the only things left!  My granddaughter is heartbroken, because we had to wait a long time for the delivery. Big disappointment!!"
2.0,Returning it. Expected it to be a little different.
2.0,"No girl likes for a leather bag to be misshapened, and unfortunately only the bottoms and the sides of this bag are leather the rest is a very soft and then cloth. It arrived very smashed and with white paint speckles all over the black leather. Absolutely not worth the price tag still debating returning it."
2.0,I am a size 4/6 and the medium is too small for me. I bought two colors :(
2.0,"A heated hoodie you would think would be very warm.  But this just barely gets warmer then it is without the heating element. It is comfortable and made wells, but even with it on it it’s highest setting I was still not much warmer than with it off."
2.0,"I am 5'8 and a size 8.  I have a 36D chest however.  Due to this I ordered an XL.<br /><br />The good:<br />-The dress is pretty<br /><br />The bad:<br />-XL still won't fit my chest but was beyond huge on my body.  It looked like a moo-moo on me.  How can it not fit D boobs, but the rest of it be big enough to accommodate about 3 people taped together?<br />-The buttons secure by being inserted into these tiny bungee string looking holes.  Since the secures are stretchy whenever you move it basically exposes you beneath them.  Also, at the right angle people will be able to see in your dress.<br />-The dress is super thin...I worry how it would hold up.<br /><br />I will be returning this..."
2.0,"These are okay when they are on, but they do fall off easily, so i can't recommend them"
2.0,"Ordered a Size 2 for my 15 yr old's Homecoming dress. The dress is beautiful and I loved the material but the stomach area is too big. The stomach area balloons out like you are bloated. It fit perfectly everywhere but the stomach area. I'm not sure if the dress we received just wasnt cut correctly, or if they all fit this way. It was purchased to be a form fitting dress and it didn't work out. Again only in the stomach area."
2.0,"They looked so cute online. I ordered a large to be warm & comfy. They don't fit. The thumb is strangely tight. I understand why people said they tore in that area. I will keep, but will give this 'large' to my very petite daughter."
2.0,Does not balance on the ear well. Besides that it's great
2.0,Beautiful at first but it tarnished very quickly.
2.0,"The pins to adjust the band are near impossible to get out and I broke the tool just trying. Three weeks later, still can't get the pins out (chopsaw and sledge hammer don't work either). Decent looking watch but simply doesn't fit."
2.0,Very difficult to get on . Will be returning them. Cute boot however
2.0,Looked cheap when received it looked better online wouldn’t recommend
2.0,Stretch too much. Catch on the floor. Find them dangerous.especially for the elderly.
2.0,"I've been buying Barricade over-glasses flip-ups for 7 or 8 years. They are good for my needs and hold up  pretty well for the price.  I usually lose them before they break or scratch. With my eye problems I need full coverage and sadly, these no longer do the job. The lenses are made much smaller now. I am a small woman with average size glasses. The sunglasses don't even cover the bottom of my regular glasses making them pretty useless. They certainly would not fit most mens' glasses"
2.0,"Excellent idea. It worked great for a few days. Gets dusty quickly, but even after cleaning, lost its effect."
2.0,Pretty but a pearl is already gone.  Will return
2.0,"Unfortunately, these were not as great as I'd hoped based on the picture.  They seemed a little dingy and faded as if they'd been in a box or in storage for quite a while and had not been protected.  They were for my daughter's birthday and I was a little disappointed to give these as a gift.  Also, they did not arrive when promised.  So, also a late birthday gift, that was disappointing."
2.0,"Product was way too small.  Color is not pink, it is a salmon color.  I think it would be a cute top - and I would consider keeping it -if they actually sold the size advertised."
2.0,Cute. Runs small so returning
2.0,The dress is a cheaper version of the one pictured. The train was the main reason I wanted this for my military ball and the train was about half the length as the one pictured. I will be returning it.
2.0,The tubes do not stretch over the lend of the leg of my sunglasses.
2.0,"Really liked the sweatshirt, but after the 1st wash one of the zipper pulls broke on the very 1st wash!"
2.0,"El diseño es bonito, pero No me gustó la tela, muy calurosa, casi plástica :("
2.0,"I had bought this for a friend who needed a larger size, but she was drowned by this! Luckily it was easy to return."
2.0,"I did not like these slippers. Though they are very cute, they are not good for little feet. The fluffiness makes standing on it impossible for little kids and it poses a twisting danger for their little ankles. Unfortunately, my daughter is not using it and it was just a waste of my money."
2.0,"These were only water resistant for me. Waterproof means you can actually get it wet....even submerge it...and your feet will not get wet. Not the case. This is my second pair of &#34;waterproof&#34; boots from Nevados. For a summer time hiking boot on a day trip, these are fine though. The Fissure waterproof shoes I currently own as well (my third pair of Nevados total) and these are actually waterproof.<br />They fit well and have great traction."
2.0,No matter how big this fabric clings and shows every bump and wrinkle.  It also runs very long but not quite long enough for a sleep shirt. I am returning.
2.0,"Had to return... I orders 2 different sizes and was having a very hard time with the fit. Was not a fan of the material.  They are a good price, but I didn't keep them."
2.0,"The thin, satin-ish feel of the fabric is cheap. The fit was true to size."
2.0,"the color is very pretty, bad part is that it is way too thin & the sewing is a bit weird"
2.0,The gray shirt is more white and the emblem does not stand out at all.<br />Does not look like the picture
2.0,I ordered a Large and it fit like a small.
2.0,"There was no Tie in my order, and no way for me to contact the seller to request it. My son's outfit is now incomplete...😥"
2.0,"Large is like a child’s large or an adult’s small, so I think the manufacturing quality control is very POOR. At least I can give it to someone, but not the person I originally intended."
2.0,"material is good quality.  shorts are too small, shirt is too big"
2.0,Would of been great but the top is way to small
2.0,This dress cost me $25 but it felt like it was worth $7. I ordered the large in an olive green and it was extremely see through. The fabric is a cheap feeling synthetic material. The neckline folds over weird too. Not a dress I am going to keep so I am going to return it.
2.0,"I love this pattern, but the fabric was a lot flimsier than I thought it would be.  I had to wrap it around my neck 3 times to get it to look right, but looks nice with my black jacket."
2.0,Item that came is not what is pictured
2.0,The bracelet started turning colors after a week.
2.0,The Knob fell off after two months so no longer functional. Clasps randomly open and come loose as well.
2.0,"Shirt is NOT black. This shirt is Navy Blue. A little smaller than expected, but overall cute shirt. Disappointed I didn’t receive the color I wanted, but got too good a deal to hassle with returning."
2.0,The stones were much larger then pictured
2.0,The chain keeps breaking.  It was cheap and maybe I expected too much.  But I'm still more than a little disappointed.
2.0,The beads are beautiful but the chain arrived broken. I am a bit confused as to how that happened. I am sad I will have to do an exchange.
2.0,"The sizing is way off, I ordered a medium when the size chart called me to be in a large. Usually a 12 in jeans. And these swallow me and the crotch area is baggy and long. I honestly should’ve ordered an XS. Material is way too stretchy."
2.0,Pretty to look at<br />Comfortable to wear but<br />Poorly made I machine washed it on gentle cycle and dried on gentle cycle - the ruffle came un - sewed right in the front so I had to stop and sew it together before leaving the house We do not expect that
2.0,"Looks great and the recipient was VERY pleased, however it broke in 2 weeks.  Wish it lasted longer. He’s a true Giants fan!"
2.0,"It seemed nice at first, but the finish flaked off after 2 weeks. The belt has also stretched several inches."
2.0,It broke after just a few months.  Wish I could get a refund!
2.0,Cheaply made. Doesn’t look as pictured.
2.0,Look is disappointing
2.0,"It rolls well, but the design doesn’t work for me. The side zippered compartment holds very little. Getting things in and out of the main compartment can be awkward because of the front “envelope” compartment. I miss having a water bottle holder on the outside like on the bag it replaced. The handles on the top are awkward to grab and fall into your way as you try to put thing in and out from the top when it’s sitting upright.  It does fit well under seats and easily into overhead compartments, but I don’t like using it."
2.0,I ordered 2 sunglasses and barely after 5 days of minimal using the color coating came off just in the middle of the nose part. This is really disappointing.
2.0,Very sheer. Came wrinkled. The tassels were coming apart. Terrible product
2.0,I had the bra for 6 weeks. I had worn it probably 7 times and washed it once. The last time I wore it the right strap completely just fell apart. I noticed the strap was lose and I went into the bathroom and the little clasp on the strap was missing and the strap was no longer any good. I called but was told they could not send me a replacement. I did receive a refund for the item. It was cheaply made and a little smaller then expected.
2.0,It looks like a scrub top
2.0,"Definitely a turtle neck, not a cowl like the model shows. Very thin. VERY short. Does not even really cover my butt. (5'9)"
2.0,"I bought a large and returned it- it was way too short (if you bent over, your bum would be out). I was really excited about this dress for a trip to the Bahamas, but decided not to keep it because of how small/short it was."
2.0,I did not receive the product pictured. No neckband.
2.0,"sweatshirt material,  not very flattering"
2.0,Returned it. Material is cheap printed polyester. Seller was great.
2.0,This outfit was purchased for my daughter. It's craftsmanship is poor quality. The seam came apart and the stitching unraveled.
2.0,"I clearly don't have the smooth figure to make this dress hang nicely, it ""showed off"" every bump and panty line-- not for me!"
2.0,To Big looking
2.0,After second wearing the letters started coming off-going to see if I can stitch or glue them back on-really disappointed about that.
2.0,"This dress was cheaply made. The  jewels were falling off.  Also, there was threads from the peacock loose.  The dress actually fit me except in the chest. It was so large it didn't sit right.  I return this dress."
2.0,Gave this pair away after trying to wear it for about 5 minutes
2.0,Nice fabric and beautiful colors. Unfortunately it’s runs very small. Also it’s much much shorter than in the photo.
2.0,"I was so excited when I got this sweater because it was very cute. That being said, when I washed and dried it according to directions (hand wash, dry Low heat) it shrunk up so bad I can’t actually wear it."
2.0,The waist is very tight. I even bought a larger size and its still very tight
2.0,"I am 5-10 and weight 175 pounds with a 31 inch waist and an athletic body.  I ordered the size recommended at they are way too small. They ride up my legs and just fit terribly.  The material is nice, but there were a total waste for my waist!  I will not buy again.  But on the upside, you can play tennis and baseball in them!"
2.0,Item shrinks upon washing. I thought I purchased a burgundy colored one and the one that arrived looks like a brown with a golden tint. I needed a more red looking one for work so this did not work for me. I do not like the color. It pills easily and shrinks.
2.0,I ordered an xxl and it fits more like a small... very disappointing
2.0,"All the ribbons immediately came off, half my chest is out (this is me fixing it so I don’t have my chest out) and the bow is nearly hitting the ground, hope you guys know how to sew because you will need to modify it."
2.0,Loved the look of this skirt but the waist is small.
2.0,I got this for an around the house shirt and the material is nice & stretchy but the shirt was not made for women with big chests. The slits on the sides come up way to high for it to be comfortable.<br />A larger size MIGHT help but I doubt it. The slits are almost to the armpits so…yeah
2.0,They bend with very little effort.  The part that goes through the ear is l-o-n-g.
2.0,Nice but then had to take a pair of tweezers to tighten them up what's going to fall apart if I didn't
2.0,Wish I hadn’t been desperate to buy inexpensive clothes that fit after gaining a lot of weight. Wasn’t being quite choosy enough because I regret keeping these hideous pants. Material and color are cheap and super ugly. At least the baby puke green ones are.
2.0,Was beautiful but didn’t last 2 weeks 😩
2.0,I’m rather disappointed. They are flimsy and cheap feeling.
2.0,"The Dress fit but it was cheaply made. It was bought for a wedding. My daughter looked beautiful regardless. Don’t get the hoop skirt to go under, it won’t fit underneath the slip of the dress."
2.0,"Fits good for 6.5in wrist but overall it runs small. If your wrist is 7.4 like it said the max is, then you will be on the last hole of the band and that's not a proper fitting band. It is a soft silicon on the inside and leather outside that feels to me like suede. The color is accurate to the pictures online. It is a very nice looking band that definitely makes your watch stand out yet adding style to your wardrobe. A versatile band that can be worn for many occasions.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />While this band looks great and is soft to the touch. It is actually uncomfortable to wear. Not sure if the bad is too thick, or that there aren't enough notches. I find myself constantly adjusting the band and wiggling the watch to find a more comfortable position. I had a friend wear it for a few days and they said the same thing. It's too bad because it really is a nice looking watch."
2.0,For is to big and will not adjust small enough for adult with smaller head.
2.0,Not what I thougth two small but will get another and make earrings
2.0,"The faux leather scratched very easily and the glue started coming apart internally. It's hard to trust anything on Amazin these days unless its a well known brand. Shame. The design itself is great, allowing for a slim wallet that allows carrying cash and cards. If only the material and gluing weren't so flimsy."
2.0,"This dress looks a lot better in the picture. The material is very cheap looking and feeling. Don't buy this, waste of money."
2.0,The size adjusting clasp is very sharp and easily scratches skin when pulling pants up and down every time you use the restroom.
2.0,I've owned these for about 3 months now and they do great with vision and clarity. However in 3 months the finish is flaking and flaking very quickly. Not sure if it's just my pair or if this is a trend among this brand.
2.0,We ordered an XL but it was the size of a medium.
2.0,One was missing the rubber piece
2.0,dress is beautiful but the under slip is sewn inside out and its very noticeable. I would like to get a refund even though Im a few days past the time of returns as I was on vacation while they were responding
2.0,Loved it...till my wrist broke out in a allergic reaction
2.0,Cheap material for what you pay. Don’t buy.
2.0,"Ugly, material is awful!"
2.0,"It doesn't stay in place and rolls up, very uncomfortable, a waste of money"
2.0,I'm really upset at how big this dress is. I could never wear it. I ordered a small...it looks like a large and it hangs off of me.
2.0,Muy chiquita incluso para mi niña de 2 años.
2.0,Fits good my daughter likes it but she just took it to Miami and two of the side straps broke oon het so she had to put safety pins in it
2.0,Very cute in the picture. It was delivered on time as promised. I wasn't pleased with the quality of the materials. Cheap looking.
2.0,It’s too wide from the legs and the hips
2.0,"Perfectly made, bur made too small and no 1/2 sizes.returnig and reordering a whole size larger. I must really like it to go through these hoops .We shall see"
2.0,Great looking... But clasp does not stay connected.  Have lost 2 so far.
2.0,It literally looks like it was drug through the mud and clawed or chewed open by and animal and this is how it was placed in the amazon bag when I opened I had dirt fall everywhere and a bunch of the charms are no good.
2.0,The owl is huge
2.0,I do not like the material of the dress. It is not as shown in picture
2.0,"Light grey is the exact same colore as white. Can someone please explain that to me? I have purchased a series of variations of this brand, but this is the last time. When the colors shipped out are not the wrong colors, it's the size that is a problem."
2.0,There was absolutely nothing I liked about it.  The picture looks Divine but as soon as I took it out of the package I knew that I had wasted my money…
2.0,"These are extremely See through, which I can live with since I’ll be wearing a bodysuit with them, however I was disappointed that there was a snag in the material right out of the package."
2.0,"the pink ones were soooo cute!!! but when i got the blueish greenish ones. they were a very dark green, very unflattering. one of the temples of the green glasses broke off after one wear and was very unsatisfied with that one pair. the mirror effect looked so good, could see my eyes a little bit but was satisfied with the pink pair."
2.0,It was not as functional as I anticipated.  It is totally my fault as I should have reasearched and thought about it a little better.  I found it to be exactly as advertised but I found it to be very uncomfortable in my pocket.
2.0,Quality is nice. Sizing is way off. Has to give it away to someone else.
2.0,"I bought 3, all in size Medium. None of them fit like the other. The sleeves are especially awkward. Bell shaped with a tapered end. For example, the pink sleeves were so overly large that it makes the look of the sweater weird. I will likely roll them up to off set the weird shape."
2.0,"I like the mint green in the picture, but I got a white one .which is alright because I like it"
2.0,"Not bad at first, but overpriced for the quality of materials. The stitching was the main culprit with several seams coming apart after a wash with other much more delicate clothing that came out fine. Oh well, trying a different brand now."
2.0,"This just fit so bizarrely. I suppose if you had a 46DDD bust and no butt, you might do ok, else it just hangs wrong and is too immodest for public wear."
2.0,Fitting is way too loose. Very thin material. Never even wore it
2.0,I love the feel and fit of these T shirts. They are very comfortable and light weight. My reason for a 2 star rating. Two washes makes this T shirt look like it's been washed 100 times. The material is all picked and looks so worn I wouldn't wear them out in public. Must be cheap material. I have other light weight T's and they don't look like this after many washes.
2.0,"It looks very real and adorable, I would reccomend wearing it if it's only going to be for a little bit such as a photoshoot or a hang out. It does start to hurt really bad after a while. It did help me realize I looked good with a septum piercing though! So it helped for that."
2.0,When you order an extra large it comes pretty much a small. But then again it's made in China period and Americans are a lot fatter than those over there. It doesn't get any bigger than an extra large so if you have C cups or above don't order this bathing suit!
2.0,The frames were extremely small.  I had to return them.
2.0,The large lenses are very poor quality (simple plastic).
2.0,"Great concept and the glasses are good, but the chain arrived terribly kinked. Bad quality, so it would have easily kinked with use."
2.0,"Runs so small, I ordered a 3x, one size larger than I normally wear. Couldn't get it over my shoulders."
2.0,very cheap material and was oddly large in some areas while small in others
2.0,"I'll only wear this out in my back yard.  The ""leather"" tabs on the ends of the hood strings are more like (and look like) thin pieces of cardboard.  The sizing is way off - very snug.<br />Unfortunately, not worth the $$"
2.0,Runs very small and the bottoms fit weirdly and offer no coverage.
2.0,"Comes disassembled. You have to put the strap in the neck holes yourself, so unless you have a tool to do that, don’t purchase. Haven’t tried it on yet, can’t until I get a stupid crochet stick to put the strap through 😡😡 who sends a dress like this"
2.0,It’s pretty bit the chain broke the first time I wore it
2.0,"This was supposed to simplify my life, but unfortunately it sits packed back in its box. First, it is easy to set up, and seems to be a sturdy product, but I couldn't get it to clean more than a four foot radius. It scoots around that circle nicely. Second, the seller didn't want it returned, instead they provided advise. I had already tried what they suggested, and now I have a useless vacuum sitting in garage."
2.0,Beautiful earrings but not functional.  They were hard to close.  I sent them back.  Not worth it.
2.0,Slide is difficult
2.0,Fabric a little lighter than expected but MUCH smaller than expected. I had removed tags before trying on or I would have sent it back.
2.0,"These pants were very cute except for the fact that they were 6 inches to short.  I am only 5'7"""
2.0,I thought it was a long shot that this would fit but gave it a try. I am 5’2 107lb. Xs top was too small in the arms and chest. Skirt is huge. Way too long. Sending back.
2.0,"I loved the rose quartz, Jade, and Amethyst(Multi pack) but for Mother’s Day she revived this in the mail instead. Thankfully she was still happy, I was just hoping for the right ones!!"
2.0,"Bought 2 months ago and got what we paid for. Looked cool and fit well but could not hold up against a 5 year olds energy level. The soles did better than the inside (see pics) These shoes would be good to keep aside as their ""nice"" pair, not meant for everyday unless you want to buy a pair every 2 months."
2.0,It’s a good quality velvet material especially for this price. The cut is slimming. However the buttons on the bust are going to break off as the threading wears down from opening and closing and will need to be resewn back on. It doesn’t come with extra buttons. I would have chosen another dress but I was pressed for time during the holidays. It’s nice other than fact the buttons will fall off soon. I chose the size small and I’m 5 3 and 125 lbs and a 27 inch waist.
2.0,"Pants came on time, as described; however, there is a hole in both calves."
2.0,"I tried to like this dress, but the waist is a weird fit.  It's neither empress or aline, just somewhere in between.  Their other dress for nicely at the waist, but not this one"
2.0,"I was very excited to have a cute purse that would fit all of my work items including a full size planner that also can be worn as a cross body bag. Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks of use, the clips for the long strap broke as they are made out of low quality plastic. I bought this as a lightening deal which is the only reason I gave two stars rather than one. Still works as a hand bag and I can't really complain about the price I paid for it."
2.0,Turned neck green. Very small
2.0,"Cute dress but has a really weird fit if you  are larger on top, very awkward fit.  The “off the shoulder” is not comfortable, feels like you should pull it up!  Material is not great but for the price it is what it is."
2.0,"i had to return this. i was hoping to wear it under a polyester (red) blouse. however, you could see it though the shirt and especially the two little back holes (weird)... they are probably there for stretch but they look bad and make it more visible under clothes. It was very snug...i tried it on without a bra and it was very uncomfortable under the boobs. that might be fixed with a bra. It does suck in your arms though!!!<br />FYI, My measurements for size reference: 5'3&#34; 130 lbs. 34C bra. 35x29x38."
2.0,The straps are cut incredibly awkwardly / narrowly so whole bra straps are shown and you would need a special bra with this to ensure the straps weren't visible. The material is very uncomfortable but perhaps with a wash it'll be softer. Sending back as I can't actually wear this as a non-workout top (which was the intention) based on how the straps are cut.
2.0,"The picture makes it look cooler than it is, but it's a good accessory I suppose."
2.0,No tummy control anything. shorts are a bit short
2.0,Its made in China so the quality isn't good. I pity Harley for putting their brand on this product. The nice thing of this product though is the hard case. Looks expensive.
2.0,These socks are thin and just like other ordinary crew socks I have... was looking for something thick and warm as advertised.
2.0,Thinner & smaller than expected. Bought for my 11yr old. I ordered a Lg thinking she could grow into it. She wears 5/6 normally but I'll be lucky if she can wear this jacket more than 1-2 years.
2.0,"Purchased for an elderly person.  It was not specified in description that there was a ""security"" zipper at the bottom which could not be undone, making it quite difficult for an older person to step into.  Also did not care for the construction (pockets offset, material not as expected (too thin)).  I will be returning this item."
2.0,This fits okay... it looked so long in the picture but it seems like for larger sizes they just made it wider (it's too short).. it's super comfortable but I'm glad I read the comments and decided to order 2 sizes larger then I normally wear. I wish people could make nice things for larger galls.
2.0,Missing strap!!! :(
2.0,"I ordered a Large since I typically wear a medium, and it fit like a small. It was too tight around my chest and didn't sit right for what appears to be a flowy shirt. I would recommend ordering 2 sizes larger if you have a chest at all. It's also more see through than it appears in the pictures so you'll have to wear something underneath. Price is good, fabric seems ok quality."
2.0,These run big don’t fit right
2.0,Self wind mechanism broke after the first month.
2.0,One one the two side zippers was broken. I had to return. Would have been cute if it wasn’t damaged though.
2.0,I’m 5’4” but wear a 28 or 29 inch inseam. The small size on these look like balloon pants because they’re way too long.
2.0,"This sweater is Bad quality, And the small size looks like large size."
2.0,This was beautiful in person but too bad it broke right away!
2.0,these shorts worked as expected. the only down side is that the top rolls down. if they had a wider waist band or suspenders then i would give this a 5
2.0,"Cute, but the the fabric quality is not good. The fabric is rather thin and it is very poorly stitched. One pocket is barely on and coming off straight out the package. Very disappointed that I will have to return this item because my daughter really liked having matching robe for her doll."
2.0,"The size of the earrings are completely OFF. pictures are deceiving,  they look way bigger on the pictures wich was what sold me on them. Good quality,  but disappointed on size."
2.0,It fits me much longer than pictured. It goes under my calves and I'm 5'4&#34;.  The material is very itchy too.
2.0,High visability letter only on 1 side
2.0,"It is not ""No Slip"" which is why I ordered this. Debating returning since it doesn't stay in place as it should."
2.0,The blue is not blue at all.  It's teal...the picture is totally deceiving.  Ordered 11 for my dance team and now have to send them all back because we needed blue.
2.0,Lock does not work
2.0,"Hat fits perfectly, but was described as a white winter hat, when in fact the color is more of a beige. It also came with a hole along the seam of the hat.<br />Overall the hat was cute, wasn’t able to wear it with the white snow pants I purchased it with because of the color difference, but I was able to fix the hole and still wear the hat."
2.0,I loved it...for the 3 hours that it worked
2.0,"Item was gray in color, not black as pictured. Needed them for a trip, had no time to exchange."
2.0,"It's more of a peach pink color which idk any white pple even close to what color it is and then when worn, it looks more like a human/monkey face. I asked another who hadn't seen this before what it was and they couldn't even guess more than some face....spent I think 15 or so by time shipping so I'm fairly disappointed considering I was really excited to wear it around but I almost don't even want the questions regarding what the heck it is"
2.0,"Horrible....Just horrible. The whole this is cheap,unflattering and way too long. It's see through and it too big. Even if you get a smaller size it's still ugly."
2.0,Looked very nice. Strap frayed the first day of use.
2.0,Too small and quality was sub par.
2.0,I bought 3 pairs of these. They are so cheap and flimsy. One pair was completely bent and unusable.
2.0,Pants fit okay but the material feels really cheap and it arrived with several flaws. The pocket sewing left a hole in one pocket and the strings look like a money sewed them. They are wearable just not the best for how much I paid. I don’t recommend these pants.
2.0,The only thing that I can say is right off the bat on the second day of him wearing these shoes the letter O came off of the shoes LOL but they're still holding together and it's been about a week so we will see. That did not look very promising.
2.0,It is not polished but brushed. Very dull in appearance.
2.0,"Buying gifts for a teenage boy is challenging at best, so when my daughter suggested this might be something my grandson would use and enjoy, I ordered it for a stocking stuffer.  In their favor, I was pleased that the watch did arrive on time for Christmas, but it failed almost the same day.  Did not keep time accurately, and there seemed to be no way to change the battery.  I should have returned it, but in the holiday confusion, it just didn't happen.  I'm sorry it didn't do what it was supposed to, because my grandson really liked the concept!"
2.0,"Ordered 7 3/8, hat is bit larger than 7 1/2.<br />4 stars if it fit."
2.0,The pendant is beautiful but did not come on the chain as pictured or described.  It came on a very short cord necklace.
2.0,Way too small even having ordered by measuring.
2.0,"This is my second order of these leggings, as the first's seams unraveled after just trying them on. After the first wash, the seams unraveled in the seat area and continue to unravel with each wash (even on a delicate cycle and hanging them dry). They need to improve upon the quality of their craftsmanship, I didn't order these leggings just to have them unwearable after 2 washes!"
2.0,I was buying these for a 2nd (maybe even 3rd time) and the new pair is HUGE compared to the old pair. I put them on and thought they were ridiculous and larger than the older pair but it wasn't until I put them side by side that I realized just how much bigger these ones were. I'm disappointed and might even be too embarrassed to wear these only while gardening.
2.0,"The chain arrived broken. There is a sharp brown edge, and the circle handle is very loose and not even closed all the way. I almost cut myself when pulling out the necklace."
2.0,The items were to small my watch
2.0,Dress does not fit or flow like the picture. Can feel the stitching where the black and red were put together. Not horrible product but won't buy another
2.0,It looks and feels cheap. Runs a little small but it works.
2.0,"i sent back, was way too wide and fell off my shoulders.  smaller size wouldn't have been better."
2.0,"Bought it (size 3xl) for my husband who is 6'3in and he is around 250lbs. It fit nice but the material seems really cheap. The faux leather seems just too fake and thin. He was disappointed it didn't seem like a good structured coat, he was afraid he would tear it too easily."
2.0,"Love that it is double sided.  Good material and high quality but if you think you are a small, this belt is actually a medium.  It is very large and does not fit my waist (which is not very small!)"
2.0,"I almost always wear a small in dresses (5'7&#34;, 130lbs, athletic build), but this was too small. The middle band was up too high and pushed everything up uncomfortably (not in a good way), the arm holes were way too small, and the hip area went out too much. It was also not comfortable. That being said, the color looked the same as online and I liked the look of the sequins. There was a liner on the dress too, so the sequins didn't scratch. It was also a nice length for a bridesmaid dress. I returned the dress and received a refund without issues."
2.0,"It' has  dull colors, not like the picture.  I personally don't think it is worth the %$"""
2.0,The shirt is super comfy and fit as expected BUT the tie dye pattern is not even at all.  One sleeve is almost entirely black and one sleeve is mostly white so where the sleeve is sewed onto the body of the shirt it looks like it came from an entirely different shirt... It's obvious the shirt was not sewed before it was dyed.  It makes my inner OCD flare and I probably won't ever wear the shirt unless the sleeves will be covered by a cardigan or jacket.
2.0,"Unfortunately, my search for the perfect slipper is still on.  These are very comfortable & keep my feet warm, but they will not stay on when I walk.  I am forever pulling them up.  Not sure why, but not happy they keep sliding down & off my feet."
2.0,Snug .  Uncomfortable
2.0,Colors not as vibrant as shown.
2.0,They don’t keep the glare down nearly as well as others I have worn. But the fit nice and are comfortable.
2.0,Very unstable. With a little wind it moves a lot
2.0,"not just a little tight, but the sewing is poor quality. Neck of shirt had fraying exposed edges that were supposed to be sewn into the neck edge. Nice fabric, and wish it had been better quality and the fit was better."
2.0,"Underwear fit well, everything else extremely large. Ordered a small"
2.0,I’m 5’10” and this was too short on me to where it was an awkward length.
2.0,Shrank up and got tossed in the donation bin.
2.0,I am muscle bound like the models in the pictures and the issue with this jumper is that you can see right through it on parts that are stretched! Its comfy because of this but I'd never wear it in public even with an undershirt because of the transparency.
2.0,This was much more cheap looking than what I expected
2.0,"The glass got scratched easy, it doesn’t feel<br />Like it cost , and the bells and whistles cannot be use the way you would think or expect to be used, After having it for a year plus, I would guess it’s worth maybe $20-$50 range"
2.0,They break very quickly and easily
2.0,"very very very thin material, it's see through"
2.0,Aeromatic 1912 is a nice looking watch and worked great for six days.<br />Seventh day the second hand started to jump three to four seconds ahead.<br />I have to say stay away from these cheep Areomatic watches. I returned it<br />but it wasn't easy. Don't make my mistake.
2.0,"I had to return this. The color was not as dark an orange as expected from the pic, but more of a pretty faded pumpkin. Also - it is not a warm sweater.... the  yarn was light and holes between yarn throughout. I will say the yarn was very soft. Also much larger than expected.<br />It could be pretty as a different garment than expected, but I was just expecting a more saturated dark color, and a thicker, more substantial sweater. I would suggest ordering a smaller size than usual because even as an oversize sweater it seemed pretty big."
2.0,My daughter loved it. It was beautiful until my pendant fell off. ON THE FIRST DAY! so now I just wear the bracelet.
2.0,Looks ship much nicer in the picture
2.0,"Update: Returning item and lowering star rating as I discovered a small hole and frayed material along seam in back. Never got to wear it. Very disappointed. Not worth what they are charging for this top.<br /><br />Cute top and would have given it 4-5 stars if the elastic in the top wasn’t so fragile and it was about $5 cheaper. I feel like it’ll need to be reinforced or replaced after a couple wearings. My first instinct was to send it back but after trying it on, I decided to keep it although I is not going to last long. Super thin material that will definitely need hand washed as it is pretty see thru. As for the fit... its ok. The large fits perfectly but the sleeves can be a little restrictive based on how u position the shoulders. Putting it on was a bit challenging.The fragile elastic doesn’t hold the top in place very well so be prepared to readjust it often. Pretty true to size as i based my choice on reviews and not the chart. I am 5’5” and about 168lbs. I just wish the material was a little better quality for the price."
2.0,They started coming off when I wore shoes...😧😖
2.0,It's only for small girls.. We thick girls can't get it...
2.0,"Looks nice,  but not adjustable!!"
2.0,The zippers on this coat are the cheapest possibly made. My main zipper pull broke in half one week into wear. I wouldn’t recommend this coat unless you’re willing to replace the zip with a functional one...
2.0,Too small for a man’s face. Great for my granddaughter.
2.0,Not what is shown in the pictures. Not the best quality picture. I am unable to represent my organization wearing this.
2.0,Very pretty but not At all like the picture. It was basically a small table cloth with a hood
2.0,Nice style. Poor craftsmanship
2.0,Very cute mask but offer very little by way of protection. Material is too thin and they don’t fit well at all.
2.0,"Must run small I order a Large fit tight. Gonna keep it, will order another one in a different color one day. Like the style"
2.0,This is cheap quality and it's really big.. I tried to cut some of the choker off some of them and resize but it didn't work out well :/
2.0,"I love the pattern and the color of these leggings - the pictures don’t do them justice, they’re so pretty in person! They’re made with a thinner spandex blend that has a slight sheen, and I think they’d be comfortable, but I can’t really speak to that thanks to the seller’s grossly inaccurate size chart.<br /><br />According to said chart and the item description, the size L (which is my usual size in leggings) actually appears to run a little smaller than average leggings…they’re supposed to fit a hip measurement of 35”. In most leggings, a L fits a hip measurement of around 40”, so I almost went a size up. Thank god I didn’t, bc the size L leggings hang off of me everywhere!<br /><br />The entire length of these is too big, from the waist/hips/butt to the thighs to the lower legs and ankles. They look like baggy sweatpants on me, but not to the extent that they could pass as sweatpants - they 100% look like too-big leggings. I’m SUPER disappointed, they’re unwearable for me.<br /><br />I washed them several times hoping they might magically shrink…they do not. That’s probably a good thing for most ppl, I’m just not one of them. I can’t recommend these for any size bc with a size chart this inaccurate, figuring out what size will fit you is a crapshoot!"
2.0,"Very disappointed it was far from a sweatshirt it was a very cheap,thin silk material for the price. It was a Christmas gift for my disabled neice and was not impressed for the price!"
2.0,smaller & material not comfortable
2.0,"Very nice shirt, but it runs small"
2.0,"I bought this for my third grader, she loved it because it come with 5 pieces. Although, the lunch box Velcro came apart after two months, and the bag is a bit small to fit 1 inch 3-ring binder and a couple of 1/2 inch workbook."
2.0,they rust
2.0,Where do I begin?  The sizing is off and the dress was very tight.  If you're into that type of fit then it might be ok.  The belt is not metal but plastic/patent leather type gold material with a black stretchy band attached. I'm 5'11 so the front of the dress barely came to my knees.  The sleeves were tight on my arms.  I wear 2XL/3XL US or 16-18 sometime 20 depending on the cut.  The material is thick but feels cheap.  Just not a fan and it was sent back.
2.0,THE WATCH LOOKS GREAT! THE CHRONOMETER DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE.  ONLY 1-1/2 YEARS OLD.
2.0,They had a long thin stain about six inches long down one thigh and they were way too long and very thin.
2.0,2 stars because we did not get what we had ordered.  I had ordered the cat socks for my daughter who LOVES all things cat.  What we got was the funny pizza ones.  I did kept the socks and gave them to another child of mine who likes silly things.  He has had no complaints on the socks.
2.0,"This product is made poorly. One leg of shorts had no seam and lots of loose threads throughout. Very sheer and low quality material and no ""tummy control."" Ridiculous wait for a prime product."
2.0,Thin and tight fit
2.0,Very thin and cheaply made! I returned it.
2.0,"Bought for my daughter. It was super cute on Amazon and with all the pictures. I bought a small. When she put it on, it was really big and just looked sloppy on her."
2.0,"I got the black one and the color rubbed off on my white jeans..... I love the look and feel of it, but will be more careful what I wear with it."
2.0,Returned. Lace wasn't nice.
2.0,Could not give it to warm. I bought 2 and neither worked.
2.0,"Poca calidad, las pulseras pierden color inmediatamente"
2.0,Larger than regular medium. Will reorder in small.  Like
2.0,It’s good for price but quality is really low and buckle is hard to close its affordable good for everyday use but look very cheap
2.0,"I bought this because it looks similar to a black one I have. The stitching on the outside looked cheap. Mismatched thread color, loose ends. The inside lining is very thin. Returned for refund after much difficulty with the seller."
2.0,I ordered a size up and it was still 3 sizes too small.  It was very cute but cheaply made.  :/
2.0,"Mehhhh....it wasn’t for me.  To me, it didn’t fit true to size.  The tan color was not attractive on my skin tone."
2.0,These were not as nice as expected and the colours looked faded on the &#34;pink and gold&#34; and the &#34;blue&#34;.
2.0,"Product was different then shown.  Beware the watch I received was branded Subjugation, had a smooth dial instead of textured.  It also has round hour makers instead of square as shown in the listing picture.  The watch itself seems to be of good quality though."
2.0,I love the quality but sad that it is tighter than expected.  I usually wear a med so went a size up after reading but my chest area is still tight.  I guess I should have done an xl so sad.  I never order online and now I know why.
2.0,Not for a short person. The high waist is too high and makes the whole upper section awkward.
2.0,"After a few months of use, it started falling apart."
2.0,No 3/4 sleeve?
2.0,The bra was difficult to get on and off and fit tightly. Also the bottom portion of the bra rolled upwards. I returned the bra.
2.0,To reverse the belt you must pry open a latch (difficult to do) versus other belts that rotate by pulling the metal part up
2.0,"Disappointed in color - the turquoise is actually powder blue (not what I was going for).<br /><br />Size is as expected, sits high up between my shoulder blades, just big enough for my 5'5&#34;. Product is made from wire frame, similar to standard wire coat hanger thickness, with a dyed pantyhose/nylon stretched over it with glitter design and fur on the back. Elastic straps are attached under the fur, and you wear the straps like a backpack. Not WOW quality but fine for the price.<br /><br />2 stars is for the color (Amazon, please ask the seller to change the picture to represent the true color). 3.5 for product itself."
2.0,I didn't like the feel of the word Honey.  Too thick and rubbery feeling and the distress kind of looks like it was folded and stuck together and just fell off.  Its the way it's distressed.  Its not damaged. I  am returning mine.
2.0,"These fit my face great and they were dark lenses which was also amazing, but after a few hours of wearing them i had this huge black streak across my forehead where they touched my face, and two black spots where the nose piece rested. i bought two pairs and they both did the same thing. now i have no use for them, no one wants to walk around with black marks on their face right? if only that wouldn't have happened these would have been great."
2.0,Material feels weird on
2.0,All I got was daddy's girl nothing stating mommy
2.0,I had to return the product because a strap rip when I tried it out.
2.0,I really like the look of the stress especially from the back. But I had to return it because it makes you look pregnant from the front! It’s too bad because it’s very cute. But the fit was way off and did not look nice.
2.0,Should have never ordered junior size glad I found the men's sizes couldn't find straight up women's size in this shirt.  LOVE the shirt
2.0,Very pretty with the pearl and wings.
2.0,"Smells like hot breath and it is way too small and heavy for wear. I would say this is best for a child's face but even then it's just so heavy there's no keeping it up. Disappointed because I had a really cool costume in mind.<br />It does look cool as room decor i guess, so it wasnt a total loss"
2.0,"My daughter wanted this for Christmas, and she was really disappointed with how the tail was bent up in packaging, and she was frustrated with how the ears wouldn't stay on or look right"
2.0,"Shirt is fine and fits as expected however, they didn't use a good quality image and the graphic looks very blurry and pixelated. I don't see me wearing this shirt, people would be like ""hey nice DGD shirt, did you do it yourself?""."
2.0,"Cheap, came apart rather quickly"
2.0,"By the guide I'm solidly a ""Large"" - 5'11, 180lbs.  I ordered an XL accounting for small sizing, but that's not even enough.  It's obnoxiously tight, especially in the arms and chest.  Maybe it's better for a runner's build, but anyone with time in the weightroom is not going to be happy.  The 'short' sleeves are also awkwardly long, going down nearly to the elbow.<br /><br />It picks up bad smells quite easily, too.<br /><br />I will say, it has nice enough stitching and the construction is good, too.  No tag, and they even have a bit of fabric over the stitching at the back of the collar for comfort.  Armpit fabric is a breathable panel.  Potential for a good shirt, here."
2.0,"The fit and material of the pants were great.  Sadly, the seams of the pant leg started ripping out the first day I wore them.  Not very well made..."
2.0,"Still haven't worn this hat. It's thin and oversized, not really my type of hat."
2.0,I have always bought this brand for my son as they are adorable and he says they are comfortable.  However this round of underwear was very disappointing.  They added an ugly tag on the outside band which I would have just dealt with but the print on them is also upside down. My son immediately frowned and asked my they were &#34;flipped over&#34;.  Will probably try to send them back since I think they are too expensive to be unhappy about.
2.0,"I loved the saying on this shirt. I normally wear between medium and large depending on the brand, so to be safe, I ordered a large. It fit a little too small for liking to begin with, but then I washed it and it is too tight. I mean, I guess if I lost 15 lbs it would be ok??? It shrank just enough that all of the letters on the front are crinkled up and you can't read them. :("
2.0,I'm only giving 2 stars because it is a beautiful top but I can't wear it. it is much smaller then the 2x I ordered. I can only imagine this is because it was made in china. I often can manage a 1x and this can't be larger then a large by USA standards. Being it has come from such a distance and it was in a plastic bag I don't see a way to return it for a refund. I'm very disappointed!
2.0,"The brim on this hat is imperfect. The fabric is loose like cheaper brands. Obviously noticeable while wearing. I'm not sure if this is an imperfect being passed off as ""Brand New"" or maybe New Era is producing products with substandard manufacturing or poor quality control. I would be reluctant to pay for a New Era  hat after this arrival. Also, the crown seems abnormally tall."
2.0,Good size ship material.. and my son 7 did not lime it.. He stated it was not Comfortable and was hurting his nose 👃🏼
2.0,"This is a nice thick fabric, and it is a mock turtleneck rather than an actual turtleneck...but the worst part is the tag has been serged to the OUTSIDE of the shirt rather than the inside. It’s not the kind of tag you can just pull out either, so I have to rip the stitching to get out the tag and resew it myself."
2.0,"My son wore this for one hour and had both pockets ripped out of it. Which he was very upset about, he said he just,put his hands in them. This coat is very thin and not at all as durable as I expected. But cute."
2.0,"Very cheap and nowhere near as nice or as detailed as in photos. Not at all what it's made to look like but, instead, just a cheap sticker on a cheap plastic set of screw top plugs. Very disappointed, I definitely won't be wearing these."
2.0,Inexpensive little piece...
2.0,Could not tell from picture what exactly I was buying. Needs to be in inches or fractions  instead of mm or cm. Why can't  all measurements  be listed?
2.0,"I was hoping this material would be similar to the athleta “uptempo” top since the cuts are very similar, but I was definitely disappointed on that front. I would compare this top’s material to a cheap version of the material in the Lulu “up for down time” top but not nearly as soft and way thinner."
2.0,They look like used.
2.0,"ITS FOR THE MOST PART COMFORTABLE, THE LEG PARTS HAVE TO BE PULLED UP FREQUENTLY THEY ARE THE KIND THAT SLIDE DOWN OFFTEN AND THE STRAPS ARE SUPER LOOSE LIKE FALLING OFF THE SHOULDERS LOOSE ALL THOUGH THEYARE ADJUSTABLE BUT THEY LOOSEN BACK UP CAUSEING THE TOP TO DROP AND IF YOU NOT CAREFULL!!!!  IVE JUST WORN MINE TO BED BECAUSE OF THESSE ISSUES CANT GO OUT IN PUBLIC AND HAVE THAT HAPPEN!"
2.0,"Looks exactly as pictured and my 6 year old loved it. Unfortunately the clasp broke off on the first day of wear (no rough play, just regular wear) and the locket doesn't close tight/completely, so the picture fell out. I returned it."
2.0,Fabric was rough & my husband is super sensitive.  He wore these once (after I washed them 3 times trying to soften them for him) & then they got moved to the Goodwill pile.
2.0,Liked the design at first but within a week and a half the gold started to fade and the gun would not stay turned the correct way. I spent more time messing around with it than actually enjoying it. One day of compliments was not worth the trouble of fixing it constantly.
2.0,"UPDATE Jun 2019: I started wearing this watch again a few months ago (I had re-boxed it put it my closet) and after about 2 months of almost daily wear/charging, the back cover has fallen off. Completely. So, construction coukd definitely be better. Dropped it a full star for this.<br /><br />UPDATE & WARNING: Please, if you have a latex allergy, avoid this watch. After wearing it for a few hours each day, an angry itchy red welt developed on my wrist. I have an allergy to latex and that is how my allergy presents after prolonged exposure. Because of this, I believe the watch band has undisclosed latex or is made with a similar chemical. I dropped it a star for not disclosing this.<br /><br />CAVEAT: I’m using this watch with an LG phone running Android 6.0, so some features may be (un)available to those using a different phone/operating system.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Understated and elegant styling--in the first week I received  three compliments from strangers while wearing it<br />+ Clear and responsive touch screen<br />+ Simple and fast pairing courtesy of on-screen prompts during initial setup<br />+ Truly is scratch-resistant as I’ve accidentally dinged this watch a few times and still not a mark on it and no loss of screen sensitivity<br />+ Battery lasts more than a day with general use (see Cons re:charger and Notes)<br />+ Issues a gentle vibration, which can be customized between 1-3 short vibes, when notifications come in<br /><br />NEUTRALS:<br />* When the screen is not manually set to sleep, every nudge or bump to the watch's face will register in a slight vibration (I generally wear my watches with face on the inside of my wrist which means the face brushes against my person quite often)<br />* It’s quirky in that the screen will be manually put to sleep (meaning it won’t turn on until you press the side button regardless of screen taps), but with no movement or input, it will go on for a few seconds and then turn off at random intervals<br />* While we're on the subject of manual sleep, notifications won't come through until you wake up the watch by pressing the button (would be sweet if you could simply put the screen to sleep without, it seems, putting the entire watch to sleep)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Once the initial tutorial is cleared, it’s difficult to relocate within the watch’s systems<br />- It’s impossible to access all the installed apps (even when following the included instructions, it will only list the initial apps in the list)<br />- It’s not as intuitive for advanced functions as it should be, it’s trial and error<br />- You’re on your own when it comes to apps and figuring out how to get them working with this watch since there’s no manual available (not even at the website) and customer service is rather silent when contacting them for more information (over a week and still waiting)<br />- The included charger is proprietary, meaning that if it gets lost or damage replacing it will be tricky and probably expensive (I plan to try an aftermarket Qi charger and see how that goes)<br />- The band isn’t user replaceable<br />- Speaking of the band it has a tendency to come undone with relative ease and lacks a loop to help prevent the watch falling off (in the few weeks I’ve had it, it’s already fallen off six times)<br />- Still speaking of the band, it isn’t breathable at all<br />- Although the screen is responsive, it doesn't always register correctly when you touch an area of the screen<br />- The microphone is subpar and if you're using it for voice-typing/commands or simply speaking with someone what you say will be muddled<br /><br />NOTES:<br />After initially setting up the watch, it downloaded an update which required nearly an hour. Rather than sitting through it, I simply placed the watch on the charger overnight. My initial charge lasted less than 7 hours of general use, however, the second day was much better coming in at well over 9 hours and subsequent days going well over 10 hours.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br />You’re paying for the name and not for an amazing smart watch. It pains me to say that because I wanted to love every bit of this watch, but don’t. Aside from being pleasant to look at, it lacks some basic functionality, makes using other features unintuitive, and lacks any customer support through Marc Jacobs.<br /><br />I will update this review periodically to note any significant changes, but in the meantime, if you have any questions about the watch or my experiences with it, please leave a comment and I’ll do my best to answer."
2.0,The size is not as the same as what was featured. My 13 yr old son did not fit. The supposed pocket to catch the hair is well established thus the hair was all over the place.
2.0,Earrings broke after 1 wearing
2.0,"I like the design of this dress. It runs a little large, I normally would order a medium but kept the small. The fabric is soft and stretchy. My only complaint is that the fabric is poor quality. I washed it once and the black is already looking faded and slightly piled. If the fabric was better I would have rated this dress 4 stars."
2.0,"I bought this as a small add on to a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. I ordered rose gold to match other jewelry I got her, and it’s now March and all of the rose gold finish has worn off. It’s still a beautiful dainty necklace, it looks just like the photo. But I don’t suggest ordering any color variation but silver from this brand."
2.0,too small!!
2.0,"You have to be extra careful even using the provided charts, try ordering another size up than what you'd expect. I couldn't return because there wasn't a larger size that would fit."
2.0,"A soft, beautiful, warm robe. My grand daughter loves it, BUT BOTH POCKETS ARE COMING UNSTITCHED. Yes, we can sew them, but should we have to on a $50.00 child’s robe????"
2.0,Won't fit if you have boobs
2.0,"Nice and comfy boots, but I've bought 2 pairs, and the outer sole never last more than 2 winters before it breaks and humidity/water seeps in."
2.0,Lens are a little dark and nose piece is too ridged
2.0,Shoulders and upper body fit fine but small arount waist.  It looked like it would be roomy but not roomy enough for my shape. :(  Material is very stiff.
2.0,These are not made well
2.0,However the pleats don't lay smoothly.  Sent back.
2.0,"La calidad de la tela es mala, no vale la pena"
2.0,Doesnt fit Samsung Galaxy s3 watch
2.0,"This shirt is not a pinkish sherbet color, it's orange.  It's halloween pumpkin orange."
2.0,"Material enhances what your trying to hide, if your a plused  size gal."
2.0,"I wish it had better quality, in this picture look better than the real one I receive."
2.0,"They are the worst ever.,very small,very bad fabric,that don’t even look like handkerchief, so if you don’t want a bad experience, don’t buy this puede of garbage."
2.0,Too much mesh for me. The stability of the shoe wasn't great. I'm sure they would be fine for someone with a wider foot
2.0,"The dart at the bust had a hole.  Returned.  The material is thin and oddly clingy.  It was like gauze and despite the dark color, can see through to underwear."
2.0,"First time opening it, the zipper broke. It's too bad because I love the design and the material. Don't waste your money on this item that is probably worth 2 cents."
2.0,"I was hoping the shirt's bottom length be longer, but it got very short after ONE washing."
2.0,Not recommend for making good quality jewelry !  They came already scratch a little.<br />A bit disappointed !
2.0,"These socks are comfortable but a shedding nightmare. I washed them and they shed all over, would not buy. I am giving them to the VA collection truck."
2.0,"Loved the coat. But the double zipper is WACK! I, let alone my 8 year old daughter, have extreme difficulty zipping up the coat. It’s a huge inconvenience trying to get out of the door and into the cold weather with a zipper that works only sometimes. This is ridiculous. Who can take it to get repaired when it’s cold outside and well, you need a coat."
2.0,It is large - which is okay.  It is very boxy - which is okay.  But the fabric is horrid!  Like dollar store fabric.
2.0,Very shallow.  Not suitable for anything thicker than card stock.  Will not re-order.
2.0,I was disappointed when I got this tank! I ordered a medium and it was way to big!!! And the color was completely different than it was in the pictures!! Won’t be purchasing these ever again!
2.0,broke after not even one full day the jump ring snagged on my shirt sleeve . its really pretty still though
2.0,The straps didn't fit.
2.0,Control top pantyhose would have accomplished more than these. Got a S/M (ordered down...or so I thought) and it’s like granny panties up to the bra line in terms of shaping. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Good quality yet sizes run really small
2.0,"Very cute socks, but the size is way off!  These are suitable for children's feet, not adult-sized feet.  The product should say Children's not say Women's in it's name."
2.0,"For amazing but the material is the same as my son’s Halloween Harry Potter outfit. Darn shame because it was cute but the material is horrible. It looks like a costume, like hey guys I’m playing financial advisor today 🤦‍♀️"
2.0,Cute and just ok! Compass is very tiny!!
2.0,The fabric was a little too see through for me to wear. There was no tummy control to speak of. In fact you could see my belly button and everything! The back went up a little higher than expect as well.
2.0,Pjs are not fire protective
2.0,"Too bad. These looked so cute in the package, but the elastic is very stiff and didn't keep it's shape on the leg holes. Weird! I'm a curvy 6. Not huge thighs, but definitely no thigh gap. The elastic and crotch felt a bit tight and like the elastic was too wide. On the outside of the legholes near my hips, when I stretched the side a bit, THE LEGHOLE JUST GOT BIG AND STAYED STRETCHED OUT. And the waistband was a bit tight, as you can see in the picture of the side of my hip--the elastic is hugging in a bit tight at my upper hip/muffin top. :)<br /><br />I am a curvy 40yo size 6/8, and usually wear size 6/7 underwear. Ordered these in medium, so maybe a large would have worked, but I strongly suspect the legholes would get stretched and gappy in no time. Oh well!"
2.0,The description has been changed since my order. It is size “L” and it is more like XXS
2.0,These jeans barely fit.  I ordered 2xl and I'm a size 15.  The chains could be stitched a little tighter.  4 popped a loose when I tried the jeans on.  They are thin jeans.  They are sexy.  Do not order if you aren't prepared to make minor adjustments to keep the chains on.
2.0,"Thr product looks like the pic. The problem for me was the chest area was just way too small.ima 44 F so there was no way my chest was gonna fit.<br />The rest of it felt nice, I think the product is meant for someone shorter because of the torso, I only wish that I also got the garters but I didnt. The sizing is wrong. Anyone that wears 16 & up don't bother."
2.0,"I think the purse is very stylish, and I love the color combination."
2.0,Tore down fast.
2.0,This dress doesn't look exactly like the picture and the material is very thin but its wearable and I will wear it this summer with cute sandals.
2.0,EXTREMELY LARGE - more like a 3 XXX
2.0,They were smaller than I expected....i would say they would be a better fit for a young girl....
2.0,"I bought these for my granddaughter who is five years old.  They stayed on just under an hour.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but they were a disappointment.  They would be fine for taking a picture if you wanted that little enhancement but overall they were a dud."
2.0,"Pretty, returned , too small"
2.0,Not silky.
2.0,My son wore to day camp and had a hole in one of them by the end of the day.  The seams are coming out of the others.  They can't survive school aged boys.
2.0,This shirt is beautiful and soft and the colors are amazing but definitely size up a couple sixes. Ordered an extra large and it fits my 8 year old.
2.0,"Do not really work, see no difference at night, things are not clear."
2.0,"The shirt is kinda giant. There's no style to it, even though the pictures allude to an asymmetric shape. To get an asymmetric shape, you have to continually adjust the shirt. It's just a giant, black, heavy shirt with bat wings."
2.0,Buttons are constantly coming undone
2.0,The leather is soft and I like the navy color. I’m going to return this bag because I can’t fit my necessities inside this small bag.
2.0,"Look fine, fit fine. They have a Brand label stitched into the left slipper heal, feels like you have one of your kids toys stuck in the slipper with every step. Would not recommend."
2.0,They don't fit that snuggly.
2.0,There were only 43 keyrings and 42 caraibiners in what was supposed to be a pack of 50 of each.  Now I don't have enough for the project I'm working on.
2.0,The zipper comes on the wrong side for a mens..
2.0,My daughter picked these leggings out due to the reviews of them not being see through. Super soft material but completely see through! Would not purchase again. Also took a really long time to arrive.
2.0,"Too wide on both straps😕. My toes pushed out the front . I do have narrow feet tho. I loved these so much, I took them to our shoe repair wizard and he is making the straps smaller which was totally difficult because the large strap is woven... like I said, he’s a wizard @ $25/shoe. Good thing I love these!!"
2.0,I returned the dress because sizing was Way off (too small). If you have any form of mom gut do not buy.  It doesn't hide your gut it makes it more prominent.<br /><br />The material was nice and the dress was pretty just not for me.
2.0,The hat came smashed. It is not reinforced front so it sags and has no shape. Just really cheaply made.
2.0,"I will not trust this strap with cheap vinyl ends on anything but a light $100 guitar.  The cotton strap itself is pretty nice, but the important part is the weakness.  It will do for $8, but be aware you are getting an $8 strap. The ends similar to the quality that you would get in a First Act guitar kit from toys r us."
2.0,"I am pretty disappointed in the lack of tummy control. I am 5'6"" and weight 135#. I have some loose skin on my lower abdomen from having children. I purchased this shapewear for a wedding I am attending and am pretty disappointed. I will be researching other products."
2.0,I ordered a size larger than the last any size dress I ordered.  It is snug and I fear it may shrink when laundered.  I am in the process of returning it.  Nice looking dress and jacket though wish I could trust one size up would do the trick!
2.0,I saw this at a store decided to get the cheap one on Amazon and it turned all coppery after I wore it three times.
2.0,Kindof look like the picture. Definitely not worth $20
2.0,"Husband doesn't like this very much. It feels pretty cheap, which wouldn't be so bad if it fit better. It's really wide and too short! Kind of disappointing."
2.0,See through so passed.
2.0,"These would have been perfect as far as the shape of the glasses and the color and size. They were not resting in a balanced manner on my nose and seemed not to be symmetrical, resulting in them drooping lower in front of one eye than the other. I felt if I tried to twist them into shape they would break. Not recommended. There are better options out there at even better prices."
2.0,where really cheaply made.
2.0,"doesn't look anything close to the picture, this dress was ugly in person, I'm sending it back"
2.0,"it took a little while to get and when i got it, it was a little big... i went by the size chart and i guess its off. i would have been fine with a large"
2.0,"These are nice and comfy leggings, though not what I expected. I ordered these because I liked the green, and instead of green there was brown, so the colors are not as advertised. Also, I thought the fleece part would be thicker. They aren't what I'm looking for, therefore I am returning them."
2.0,Cheaply made.<br />The design is very pretty but so cheaply made. Not worth the price
2.0,The collar area is to wide. I prefer a tighter collar
2.0,I bought this to use at a Ragnar race. Used it for a few runs not longer than 30 minutes..I wore it for my night run and the battery ran out in 30 minutes!!! It was not worth the money I paid
2.0,"Loved the style, as compared to other compression socks.  However, they do not stay up and both pairs of the polka-dot design developed holes after a few months of wear."
2.0,It looked nice but way to big  couldn't wear.
2.0,"The description says the dress has ""some stretch"" but the dress has zero stretch. It has a rayon look and feel."
2.0,"be a stick body, us girls with curves need better support.  unless you just want minimal coverage.  B or smaller cup would be best."
2.0,This is nice. I rated it a 2 because it is not cut to size. I strongly recommend you purchase a larger size.
2.0,The product is a nice idea but it fell apart the first day trying them out. A plastic piece that holds the arm into the frame came off. Without it the arm does not stay in<br /><br />Cool product but not worth it
2.0,It is to small it never asked for a size
2.0,Really cheaply made. Not worth what I paid.
2.0,While the look of these &#34;stopper&#34; beads was pleasing the fact that they didn't stop anything was a big disappointment. As I tried each bead and watched with optimism that this one will work only to see it slide down to the bottom with no thought of stopping all the while saying I will never again purchase another set of &#34;stopper&#34; beads.  Its a great idea if it worked.
2.0,"I like the support on the top, but bottom area is so uncomfortable. because of the seam line in the bottom area; it doesn't make your butt smooth and shaped under dress."
2.0,Thicker material than I’d like. Not as flattering as other brand. It’s alright for the price.
2.0,Just looked cheapo
2.0,I dislike that all the buttons are falling off. I would espect them to stay on for what I paid for the sweaters. But it is what it is
2.0,"I don't love these. I will wear the around the house, but not outside. They feel and look cheap. Cozy, just super cheap."
2.0,The zipper broke and then fell off
2.0,"Like all leather, it wears and tears. I had accidentally gotten this wet and not only did it damage the leather but the blue part of this is dyed; it came off real quick and was no longer wearable because it looked horrible. The leaf charm eventually came off by itself and the beads were sliding left and right. I wouldnt buy this for anyone"
2.0,I bought one of these pair of pants a while ago and I absolutely love them since then I've tried to buy two more pairs since I wear mine every day but for some reason they are making them different dimensions then before and they fit very weirdly I thought I could sew the legs to be smaller but the crotch is made smaller then the one I like so I'm very disappointed I had to buy two more to realize they are all different
2.0,A watch band should come with pins to insatall it
2.0,nice wallet but snap closure is broken.
2.0,Somewhat disappointed of what it is advertised. Cheap material
2.0,sparkles but the quality of settings is not as nice as photograph. I  would not recommend to anyone to purchase
2.0,"The item I received is very long. Seems much longer than advertised. Although everything else seems right and it seems high quality, I would not recommend this product."
2.0,"This product is only good if you want cosmetic glasses for giving a look. Did not protect my eyes from glare or blue light, my eyes still hurt after late might gaming and it provides no tinting of any kind."
2.0,Runs very small order larger for US sizes.
2.0,I liked the solid sturdy hoop. The clasp was difficult to open and close. I still will search for the perfect set of hoops.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these swim briefs, but in the end they just don't work for me.  I will say that the one really nice thing about them is the material.  It's a nylon/Spandex blend that feels great against your skin.  It also looks pretty great too, since it's the kind of material that really clings to every bulge and crevice of your male body.  The way the material clings to your body along with the way this suit is cut leaves very little to the imagination.  If you want some briefs that you can wear around the pool or the beach to show off everything you've got, then this might be just what you need.  <br /><br />I go lap swimming at the Y 4 or 5 times a week.  I tried these briefs exactly once for lap swimming and won't ever again.  The problem?  They don't have a drawstring!  As soon as you get into the water, this type of material tends to relax a bit, so it's not as tight on you as it is when dry.  As soon as you start swimming, you'll feel the suit starting to be pulled down.  And that's not helpful when you're trying to swim laps.  <br /><br />Earlier I mentioned the cut of the suit.  That's the other strange thing about them in my opinion.  It's as if the front piece of material covering your man bits is too narrow.  There's just too much of a gap between the front material and the inner sides of your legs.  I've found that how you ""dress"" determines how exposed you feel in this suit.  If you ""dress down"", it's not too bad.  But if you ""dress up"", then the front material is likely more tented and pulled away from your body.  And when that happens, there's an observable gap on either side of the front material.  Yes, I said observable.  If you dress that way (up), I strongly suggest completely shaving that area.  Otherwise, you need to be prepared to show off your pubic hair to any onlookers.  <br /><br />Bottom line:  Great for showing off at the pool or beach.  Not good at all for swimming.  "
2.0,"The size chart was not accurate. This item is tight fitting around the waist and loose at the top. It doesn’t fit the way it’s shown in the photo. It arrived in a clear bag that was maroon (color of the shirt) as though the color had been spray painted. I’m returning it if possible. The fabric is soft and stretchy like a dry-fit, though so it probably would be comfy if it fit properly."
2.0,Cheapest jewelry I’ve ever worn.
2.0,Too snug fitted..
2.0,Doesn't come with skirt as shows so very disappointing.
2.0,Too small and different from what I saw online
2.0,"It was not what was expected, and it had a chemical smell. I bought because I thought I was getting a bargain, but I did not."
2.0,Loose ear pieces. Don’t shy on face. They look nice but not put together very well. My son keeps sunglasses on all the time and these just slide off his face and annoy him so He takes them Off
2.0,Not flattering. Not made for curvy woman like myself with hips. Cheap costume like material. Doesn’t fit as expected.
2.0,The fit was proportionately off - it felt as if it was tight in places it should not have been tight
2.0,One of the clips snapped broken after a 3 months. Now I have to use a safety pin to attach it to my sock.
2.0,It did not match the description
2.0,So cute but broke after 2 days.
2.0,These didn't seem to help cut the glare for me. I returned them.
2.0,"Pockets were sewn half way shut.  Had to rip out the stitching. They had black smears on them, like the got stuck in a pully, or rollers . One side seem opened after one wash . Not well constructed."
2.0,"This necklace is adorable!  I bought 2, and one broke the first time wearing it."
2.0,"So thin, completely see through!!  Must pay return shipping."
2.0,"The material was nice, but the inseams on the inner legs were thick and intolerable. The waistband was also a little snug even though the rest fit."
2.0,Not a good fit especially for the ears I don’t think it was measured too well I think it needed some spandex or some thing to stretch it around your ears
2.0,"The fit of these pants is far too small, but the flannel fabric is quite soft. Disappointed in the size as the intended user will not get to wear them."
2.0,not to crazy
2.0,"Beach coverup is not nearly as bright of color as pictured, had to return."
2.0,too big i needed an x small
2.0,"Another disappointing swimsuit. This one fit ok, or at least it wasn't incredibly small or large, however the construction was really poor. The top folded over the band and provided no support and while the bottoms fit ok they were still not cut in the most flattering way. Definitely get what you pay for with this suit."
2.0,"Pretty bracelet, nice color, cute charms, but t there is no way to connect it! Maybe that's why it is so very inexpensive. We got a clasp at the hobby shop. My daughter really likes the bracelet."
2.0,Will be returning them. I read a few reviews and should have paid attention to the ones that stated the arch is in the wrong spot. It's under my heal not my arch and I couldn't seem to wiggle them into place.
2.0,This is such a cute shirt and yet shoddy workmanship makes it not worth the price. It looks like it will start shredding at the edges with the first wash. Even $10 is too much for this lack of quality.
2.0,This Jacket too large for the actual side. I have my kid wear the side 12 on CK jacket at Macy mall or Kid 77 Jacket online order and he have never have problem with the side.
2.0,This product does not look like the one in the picture. The color looks a lot paler than the one in the image. Visible stitches on the dress front looks odd. I bought size S and it fits loosely near the shoulders and S is my usual size on other garments too.
2.0,Literally no glitter on this.... it will work for what it is... but not exactly a dressed up mask...
2.0,"Good shirts, I guess. 1st time I ordered them, no problem. 2nd time, still good. They are a different brand every time and I hope I get lucky again but feelin doubtful. I ordered for a 3rd time on May 8th and it is now June 7th! Expect from China by June 20th...three sizes too small. I already know. Ugh."
2.0,Bought it for my wife to use. Fit and function are just okay. Wisconsin winters can be brutally cold. The material seems fairly thin and it is difficult to get it to fit. If you wear glasses it will fog them in no time.
2.0,I'm 116 lbs and wear a size 4 and dress is tiny.
2.0,I liked everything about the pants but the length. I'm 5 foot 7 inches talk and the XL are about 5inches too long
2.0,Ultimately if it wasn’t made out of the worlds most scratchy material it would have been cute. But I literally felt like it was scratching and cutting me. I had to return it.
2.0,"I absolutely cannot recommend these slippers.  My daughter wears a size 13, the length was fine but the sipper was way to tight to put on and she needed help getting them on and off, she is 5 and a half so she knows how to put slippers on.  They don't have enough give/stretch and gave her red marks.  I would have given them 1 star but they are shiny sparkly and have the look of a great dress up slipper.  Some of the maribu came of during her first time wearing them but I didn't expect that would stay on too long."
2.0,"Do not buy this suit. Although I would say it fits as expected, it is very poorly made. The stitching is awful and it is definitely not a suit you'd actually going swimming with. Save your money and find something else."
2.0,These did not fit my shoe. They were way too small. Order a size bigger!
2.0,"These were much too big, and the thumb in particular was way too long"
2.0,"My daughter was so excited for this bracelet and loved it when it came in.  However, the pink color on the beads started coming off after just a couple days of wearing it.  Most of them are clear now.  For that price, definitely not satisfied."
2.0,"I really did like the look and fit of these, but some of the seams split after only a couple of washes."
2.0,When You washed out the color 😩
2.0,I actually returned the item. The 2 thicker hooks were a little to short and then all the thinner ones were to long. They also felt like they were made out of a cheap material and would break easily. I personally didn't like them but thats just my opinion. Not what I expected.
2.0,I ordered this in a XS. Overall I would say it fit more like a Small with one exception: the ends of the sleeves (that are supposed to be snug around a woman's forearms) were literally wide enough to fit a male bodybuilder's biceps. They were absolutely ridiculous. I returned it.
2.0,The color is not what was represented or described on the Amazon. It's at best a red candy apple red color.  The fabric stretches.<br />I like the shirt  but not the color. Fits well and as expected.
2.0,Ran to small.
2.0,"I thought the dress was beautiful but it was not the right dress for me. I had to return it. Its definitely not made for shorter people. I'm 5'4"" and it fit me like a little girl trying on her mothers wedding dress, it just hung on me."
2.0,Tassle was loose and fell off and is now lost.  The picture pasted onto the back is starting to peel.  Not recommended.
2.0,"Me habia gustado  mucho habia pensado comprar otros colores,  tengo otras bolsas de esta marca pense que me duraria como la negra y la cafe pero no, ya se empezo a descamar la piel de un lado donde va la correa  y de la  correa donde se cuelga tbn"
2.0,"looks nice but strap broke within a month without sustaining abuse of any kind. As far as the watch itself, also stopped working."
2.0,It was broken when I got it..
2.0,Purchased two pair of these in XL.  I would not purchase again. When you first put them on you can hear the material stretching and cracking as if threads are breaking there is no visible damage but you can hear the material snapping and popping. The length fits fine how ever the “tummy control” lacks.  There are better pants out there for tummy control. They are snug fitting but no control. They are high waist but they do not stay up where you put them during work outs. Constantly had to re adjust during exercise. Would not purchase again.
2.0,The description states dainty.<br />these are not dainty. they are huge..and very heavy.
2.0,"This shirt is cute and flattering, but the material is scratchy and I haven't been able to wear it more than once because it has this lingering chemical smell that I can't seem to wash out. I've washed it 4 times now, and still a weird smell! I had it hanging in my closet next to another shirt, and now the other shirt has picked up the weird chemical smell too. I don't see myself getting much use out of this shirt as a result, unfortunately."
2.0,"The box was nice, although the links themselves left a bit to be desired.  They had come polished, but with scratches on them.  I have worn them once a week since I got them, and they are showing dull and beat up.  Would  not order again, but they worked for something cheap in a pinch"
2.0,"The sleeves are to short and I don’t have long arms.  The size is appropriate so I didn’t return it, otherwise I would like it better."
2.0,"Waayy too V cut, safety pinned the middle together but the straps were still a little too long, am going to self-alter them when I get a chance, over all cute, but not as cute as pictured"
2.0,I really like this brand but I was expecting it to have the logo on it.
2.0,"This fit very oddly. Unless your pony tail is at the nape of your neck the hat sits too high up in the back making the front dip down and then you can't see. It is very feminine and cute, I'm sad it wasn't a good fit."
2.0,"The quality is nice, but the color is completely off from the picture. It's not as bright!"
2.0,"I like the ties a lot! Nice quality, sturdy and well made, and very colorful. However, my ""2 tie mixed set"" was not that at all. I received the same tie x 2.  I gave one away to a friend. Sad I didn't get the two, but happy to share the tie with someone. If I could change anything about the amazon page  for these ties... have the ability to ""mix"" but custom the mix a bit. Because if I'd have paid for this ""mixed set"" and got what I got... I'd be very disappointed and upset. A fair TWO STAR amazon item."
2.0,"Until today this backpack would have received a 5 star rating from me.  It has great space, is super cute, right price.  I’ve never had more than a makeup bag, sugar meter/insulin case, tiny wallet, one small set of keys, and sunglasses in there.  I was in line at the grocery store JUST NOW and the strap came straight out of the seams.  I’m ordering another because I need the bag - I’m pregnant and my shoulders are killing me with a one-strap purse, but this never should have happened.  It was never nearly heavy enough to create that kind of tension for a clean break.  A refund or even exchange is appropriate."
2.0,"Is not like this picture, is different an low quality."
2.0,First it came so out of shape it took 2days to get it only slightly tweaked..<br />I have an old soaker hat (that needs to be retired) and it soaks up a lot more water and is much cooler.  I  live in Arizona and its summer.  Was looking for a new golf hat and this isn't it.
2.0,It’s a cute dress but very thin and cheaply made. Had to return bc it’s not flattering at all.
2.0,"I wanted a knee length dress and this was more mid-calf. Thin and stretchy, perfect for summer, but I would've needed to be taller than 5'3"" with 3"" heels. I had to return."
2.0,"Despite the reviews, this product did not fit the expected size; disappointing."
2.0,"Extremely small. Shopping and delivery were great, but when I received it I was so surprised how small it was. Barely fits my nose, not sure if I can keep it in long"
2.0,I’m 5”10 160 pounds I ordered a medium but needed a small.
2.0,"The ring is too big to be a toe ring for me, in addition to the fact that the om symbol and lotus are barely visible on the ring. The full symbol on both isn't even indented into the ring, nor are they black like they appear in the image."
2.0,"Cute, but wayyyy too small. Not great quality either"
2.0,Disappointed in how small it was. Returned.
2.0,Some were too big but they seem ok the quality is not the best
2.0,This shirt is extremely small!!!! A size small would need to order a large to find proper fit!
2.0,Very pretty but very fragile.
2.0,A little disappointed. It didn't even last 6 weeks before falling apart.
2.0,Although this is a cute and good quality jean short they're extremely small. I ordered an XL even though I am usually an L because I expected them to fit a little bit small but these are incredibly tiny. I honestly would go two maybe even three sizes larger especially if you have a big but because that was the tightest area for me.
2.0,This shirt was way too small. The button in the back fell off as I got the shirt out of the package. Pretty shirt but not sure it’s made very well.
2.0,"I love the style and cut of jeans just a size or 2 too small! Order up, doesn't have much stretch to them at all'"
2.0,Way too small and way too tight
2.0,This bracelet is nice but the clasp is not dependable. I lost it within 30 minutes of wearing it. Luckily I was at home & found it. Return is too much trouble so I will attempt to change the clasp.
2.0,"This is a super thin fabric.  it was very pretty, but I can't wear it without a slip which defeats the purpose of a summer dress to me."
2.0,"While the charms are pretty, there are not 100pcs. as advertised. Disappointed."
2.0,"Super thin, somewhat cheap quality. If you can wear skinny jeans, these might be good for you. If you are over 25 years old, they are going to be about two sizes two small."
2.0,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this bracelet. Not only does it look like it came from a gumball machine, you can NOT read what it says at all, half the letters were missing."
2.0,Does not keep time
2.0,"it is really short and small. not flattering at all like in the picture. it is cute, but it is not for someone tall, maybe someone petite"
2.0,One night of wear and its already falling apart. It was cold so I even had it covered the whole time. Not really worth.
2.0,I like the zipper opening.<br />Don't like the material. It looks like fabric cut from a dress. And it's to large. I would not buy again
2.0,I’ve had this product for less than 2 months and they’ve already faded and turned rusted. The anklets are very thin and easily can break.
2.0,It's cute but definetely more like a small then large.
2.0,"Like it, but three days in a gust of wind blew it over and the cheaply made structure holding up the umbrella broke and because its just rivets and cheap aluminum bars, the umbrella won't stay up any more.  The second umbrella torn at a weakly attached point where the arm holds the fabric in place, and the umbrella sags now.  2 umbrellas, almost $350.00 in cost, and three days in, they both are trashed.  Poorly made crap is the order of the day in retails now, and I'm back to using the faded umbrellas I tried to replace.  Better off buying the cheaper brands and throwing them away later.  Thanks for the Chinese garbage umbrellas Le Papillon."
2.0,"Thin material, wrinkles"
2.0,"Reasonably soft and thin; not an objectively good or a bad thing. My preference would be a bit more robust. The strap has some stretch in it due to its level of thinness/suppleness. Overall I like my chromexcel to be just a bit thicker. However, for someone wanting a more supple and thin strap, this is great.<br /><br />I like the look of the strap a LOT and the hardware is nice. However the foldovers near the stitching aren't aligned and one of the straps is cut to 19mm, while the other is about 19.5mm (order was for 20mm).<br /><br />The quick change spring bars are fairly convenient but its convenience is only appreciable if you're changing straps frequently with other straps that have the same spring bars, other wise you're going to end up just using regular springbars for the other strap. In addition to this, they are somewhat visible while wearing.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend the product as is (have not contacted the company) due to the fit and finish. Otherwise the materials are well chosen, it is comfortable, and it can be very convenient. If you don't feel like searching around for this kind of thing on etsy or instagram, this should get the job done for you with the help of amazons return policy and your patience."
2.0,Complicado la configuración
2.0,I’m a 32D and was falling out of it. Also it’s hard to put on.
2.0,Very unflattering. I don't think I will ever wear this dress.<br />The print looks way better on the pictures.
2.0,"This is what we (in the USA) would consider a &#34;womans&#34; vest, because it zips on the opposite side as men's clothing does in this country.  The material is very thin, and the zippers are plastic. Decent looking vest, but not rugged."
2.0,"I really wanted to love these gloves. The color and material were amazing. They felt very comfortable too, but like other reviewers, they tore so easily and by 2 weeks the threading was coming undone and also it did not keep my fingers warm at all!!<br /><br />I will def not buy these again. I only put 2 stars because I love the purple color, just wish it was better quality."
2.0,I bought this for the pendant - I used it in a craft project and worked beautifully.<br /><br />Good thing I didn’t buy it to wear it - the chain broke within a minute.
2.0,"They were cute and fit a 13 year old ear. 3 months old and not worn every day, the enamel center came out of one of the earrings.  Too bad they aren't made well."
2.0,"There are large vents on the upper shell which are clearly not windproof. The legs are very, very thin. I returned this item."
2.0,This dress doesn't  look like I expected..The shoulder area fits weird...
2.0,This broke in 6 months. Split right in the middle between the bust--I've never had a bra do that in my life! Until that point it was a fine bra. Just fine.
2.0,I actually think this piece is cute; but I was quite disappointed that the ring had snapped off before it arrived. We had to take it and have it repaired...
2.0,The pants fit fine but the shirt was very short in the torso after just one wash.
2.0,"The dress was way too short.  I am 5’7” and bought a larger size, hoping that would help.  Also the neckline plunges considerably more than the picture indicated.  It’s going back."
2.0,The chest area is small and the fabric of the skirt is weird and bulky.  Returned
2.0,"fit is ok, and i like it, but it snags SUPER EASY....ugh"
2.0,Sorry to see it was so small size has to be put up
2.0,Exchanged them too short in the waist.
2.0,Good material and nice color ! VERY poorly made. It doesn’t fit at all. Can’t  wear it !
2.0,The edge of the face is starting to come undone and I have had it for a week.  If it rips out anymore I will not feel comfortable carrying it on my keychain.  I am probably going to get a different one soon but good for a short time.
2.0,"Looks like the photo, except mine was missing a spike when I received it. 😕"
2.0,"I was looking for a new set of glide sandals for the summer.  I found these and was pleased that they were an American Company and they were using recycled products to make the shoe.  At only about $22 shipped for the sandals this seemed like a great buy.  When I got them I was very disappointed however.  The length of the shoe was fine, but the part that holds your foot in was incredibly tight.  I could not get my foot into the sandal completely without forcefully jamming it in.  At that point the shoe is uncomfortable, looks ridiculous, eventually slides off anyway, and can't be good on the material.<br /><br />I would buy these again if they could make them right, but until then I have to downgrade it and send them back.  The shoe is supposed to be all about comfort and getting on and off quickly....it is anything but.<br /><br />I still applaud them for the recyced shoe and that they are an American Company trying to make something."
2.0,Looked good but wore out with regular “kid” use.
2.0,Armholes are weird and uncomfortable
2.0,This shirt runs big and it is a very stretchy material. I gave it only 2 stars because it runs big and with the  bunching I feel like it looks like a maternity top.
2.0,"Not yellow, more of a goldie brown"
2.0,"Seems like a great quality leotard, but the area around the legs needs to be tighter to keep from showing body parts. It fit my daughters body great but is was almost as if someone very large tried it on and stretched out the leg area"
2.0,Pretty until the stones fall out. Lasted less than 6 months.
2.0,No me convencio la tela.
2.0,They are much more narrower than I was expecting. They fit well and are functional but are not what I was hopeing for.
2.0,Size up two sizes at least!
2.0,"it's very pretty, but color faded quickly."
2.0,I never write reviews but I had to for this product. Buyers beware this runs really small. I order a extra large and it was more like a small. I gave them to my friend that is tiny. They looked cute and would have love them to fit.
2.0,Top was super cute but bottoms were WAY too small. Barely covers what it needs to and is very low rise. The top was almost too big and the bottoms were way too small. Odd fit
2.0,"This costume is really great, I feel badass, but with two right arm sleeves it’s not going to work. So disappointed because I don’t have time to reorder now."
2.0,Too small for my two year old. Hate won’t stay on her head and wish it were warmer.
2.0,It's cut like a woman's shirt.
2.0,5days. The man's ring lose the dimond
2.0,kind of plain but ok
2.0,"The color was perfect, and the fit was great. What isn't great is the feel of the robe- it feels more like a loofa that you wear, which is as unpleasant as that image sounds. I've washed and used fabric softener to no avail. Now that the belt is coming apart, I plan on turning it into wash cloths for cleaning around the house. I expect my floors will be shiny enough to see myself ordering a new robe in."
2.0,Cute sweatshirt but runs small.
2.0,Does not stay closed with this clip.
2.0,"It's a decent coat, but it's a little bit more green-gray than just gray. Also, it's a bit thinner than I'd have liked. While a nice coat, probably not worth $60.00<br /><br />As an update and after seeing my husband wear it outside, it's definitely green and not gray so I got the wrong color which is disappointing but not a big enough of an issue to mess with a return."
2.0,"The bag itself is good holds everything I need , the only issue I have had is after 2weeks of using the plastic snaps broke and the shoulder strap never stays adjusted."
2.0,the arms seem very large and long
2.0,"I wore them once and put them in carrying case and in glove compartment, next day I took them out to wear them again and they were all scratched, look like cracked glass. Not good!"
2.0,"Very restrictive of movement. I didn't like the fabric, it wasn't super soft. Ended up returning these."
2.0,"WAY too small!!!  Couldn't get over her shoulders OR up over her hips!  order AT LEAST 2 sizes bigger than the conversion table specifies, or you'll NEVER get into it!"
2.0,"Product too small, ordered 2 other sets"
2.0,Poor clip. You get what you pay for
2.0,"Adorable print and good fit.<br />But after washing it's a crumpled, wrinkled mess!<br />I haven't ironed my uniforms since the 1980's and have no time to do it now.<br />I have older Tooniforms which are in excellent shape so I'm really disappointed."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:3124f21d5045f8baad6e8b006c888f2]] Great shirt besides the fact it came with what looks to be bleach stains on front and back.
2.0,Only liked colors and quantity for the price.  Smell of the painted  product was awful when bag was opened and product left black residue on hands. Had to leave opened bag outside of home to air out.
2.0,"I was very disapointed with this purchase... From the picture the pendant looked small about the size of a penny or a dime,and ended up being very big about the size of a half dollar coin... the chain I thought was going to look like the picture but it didn't either and the packaging was very cheap .... on the positive side it is pretty and the shipping was fast."
2.0,They fit but are semi-transparent.  I was hoping to get a while legging that was not &#34;see thru&#34; and these are not they so I returned them.
2.0,Loved the product when I first received it but unfortunately was only able to wear it on one occasion. The chain broke after wearing it for only an hour.
2.0,"There were only 20 rings included, not 24 as listed"
2.0,Sized small. Order up.
2.0,Not great for the pricing
2.0,"It’s a very cute ring, but My finger turned green immediately"
2.0,Not the exact fit
2.0,"I purchased these a couple years ago and they were my favorite leggings. But the new ones have changed and don't stay up well. It's a pain wearing them because I'm always having to pull them back up, especially if I'm trying to work out."
2.0,I bought both pairs of the Christmas pajamas.  I don't think they fit like the non seasonal pajamas because the other reviews said they should fit as expected.  They are way too small!!!  I wear a size 12-14 normally.  I purchased the Santa pajamas in a XXXL and they barely fit around the waist.  They fit like a large.  The length is good (I am 5'10).  The Elk-Grey pajamas I ordered a XXL because that was the biggest size.  They fit like a medium....  I haven't fit into a medium since before children.  They are going back.  The return is easy to Kohls or UPS.
2.0,Didn’t like<br />Too big and way too long and a cheap material
2.0,"Way too small, and the fabric is much thinner than I was expecting."
2.0,It's more on a work attire not a cocktail outfit
2.0,These are weirdest socks I have ever had. They have no shape. They look like a tube with an end sewn shut. They are too large for a female. Would be good for men.
2.0,"This looks nothing like the picture :( The material is this odd thick stretchy material that doesnt look flattering at all and the elastic band around the waist bunches up really bad. I am 5' 6&#34; 36 chest 26 waist 36 hips and the size small was large and did not fit well. The quality wasnt bad, as in, if you like that type of material then maybe you would like the dress but it wasnt flattering on me in the slightest."
2.0,Very cheap and long enough to cover your behind it looks long but it's not. I returned this item
2.0,Great looking shirt but the neck is so incredibly large that I never wear it. Can’t really wear another shirt underneath it either because it doesn’t look good.
2.0,"The photos for this product were a bit inconsistent. The pictures with the jacket on the model showed a true waffle knit material, but the pictures of the product by itself showed something very different. I still got it hoping it would look like the pictures on the model, but it does not even compare. The material feels fairly cheap and it doesn't have the waffle knit look I was wanting. The color is more yellow-y than your normal beige as well. It's not terrible, but not what I was expecting at all. Will probably just wear it around the house."
2.0,"It's a cute size. But it's not leather, it's cheap vinyl. Mine came w/ strap unattached. Had to figure out how to attach it. It did come early though"
2.0,I love the fabric and the style of the dress.  I ordered it in a large but received a medium which was too tight.  I wish there was a way to exchange rather that refund this item.  And it's a pity that I've searched for a way to contact the seller just to find out there's no way to.
2.0,"The black bording fades after a couple of washes. Other than that, for the price, they're ok."
2.0,"The top fit ok, but the bottoms were too small if you have a big booty."
2.0,Absolutely beautiful. My daughter loved them. However after just one hour in her ear the long post snapped off. I had to return them. We were so disappointed. Return was easy.
2.0,I usually wear a small but I got a medium. It is very tight and it is not at all low cut like shown in the pictures.
2.0,"This has to have been the best purchase I've made in a while. I used to buy the Victoria's Secret bombshell bra, but for $50.. nope. These are exactly the same.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />You get what you paid for, It's been barely 5 months and these have started to fall apart. One has already snapped in the middle, today I discovered two others barely being held by a piece of thread."
2.0,It was too small 😪
2.0,The hat is cute. The mittens are thin and the neck scarf I could wear.  Sent it back.
2.0,"if your needing a 46c, order about a 52c. unless they are tagged wrong."
2.0,"This style looks cute, and the color was true to the photo. It's soft and stretchy. The neck of the shirt is not that relaxed at all, and fits much closer around your neck. If you want the loose, draped shirt the way the model wears it. order up two sizes."
2.0,I returned the dress. It was oddly shaped and made poorly.
2.0,Really large in the top portion and legs not long enough. Husband doesn't like them.
2.0,"Kind of skimpy, shapeless. Not as cute as I thought it would be.<br />Didn't hang right for me."
2.0,I like the material and all. But it is like 2 sizes smaller than the size stated.
2.0,I ordered a large...way too small. I am usually a medium but sized up according to reviews. No stretch. Even though they didn’t fit they are super cute!
2.0,Product was too small so I had to return and get a different size. They are also not very wide for the foot so I would suggest going a full size up.
2.0,"These leggings run small.  The XXL were more like a L and it's low rise in the back so you can't bend over if you have curves.  The material was ok, kind of hot after wearing for only 5 minutes. I did like the color - it was perfect.  Returned"
2.0,Hurts me and my kids gums
2.0,"This is running very 'form-fitting', and washed up poorly.  It will be used only as extra warmth under outerwear."
2.0,They’re super small and never sat right in my ears. Maybe good for small children but I don’t recommend them for adults.
2.0,Gave it as a gift but the recipient was not impressed with cheap look of it and asked &#34;who is George . Smith?&#34;  Told her it could be any homeless person(s).
2.0,way way to big..... very sad
2.0,Way way way too small for me to wear
2.0,I thought this was going to be bigger fitting like it looks in the picture but its not<br />Colors are similar to the picture however the shirt looks more navy then black.<br />But fabric isn't what I expected
2.0,Shirt has tight sleeves and is very short. Not good if you have a long torso. Looks stupid on.
2.0,"The design of these leg warmers and quality, cost is good but sadly these are not for babies less than a year old. Wish they made these for infants! it would get so easy to do all those diaper changes."
2.0,I think this is an awesome product but I was under the impression I was getting two being I have two shoulders. That's my fault I should have read the description before purchase
2.0,"The suit was cute but way too small. I ordered according to the sizing chart, but apparently I should have ordered at least one size larger. I'm not a very big person, but I couldn't even get it to cover my chest because it was so short in the torso. I had to send it back."
2.0,"I had to wrestle with the front adjustable tabs just to get the elastic (2&#34; wide) suspender bands free from the inner teeth of the metal adjustment tabs. This ultimately, even after trying NOT to do anything that would scratch the elastic, the tabs were so tightly dug into the place where whatever factory made them, that it was impossible to NOT do some damage to the FRONT (what others see first while one wears these).<br />I would love my money back, but quite frankly, the company owes the public a &#34;buyer beware&#34; in the description more."
2.0,Material is bulky and ill-fitting. They feel like they’re made to fit extra wide feet. I don’t have thin legs but these socks are still falling down below my knees every couple steps.
2.0,Feels looser than I would have expected.
2.0,Good for 1 day use. Material is cheap and doesn't last long.
2.0,The shoes split on the side after use for lawncare. The soles are not heavily stitched.
2.0,"This is a very thin chain. My wife wanted to hang a pendant from it, but it is too thin and we fear it may break. So we are going to return it."
2.0,Fit is fine but it is very boxy. Color isn't as expected. It is more of a dusty salmon I was hoping for a soft pink.
2.0,Definitely not a wide width.
2.0,"I've been using packing cubes for a long time -- it's a great way to organize your luggage.  The problem with this set is how TINY the cubes are.  The larger one is so small that I was only able to get a few t-shirts in it.  The smaller one is best used for toiletries, although I have other toiletry bags that are much better designed.<br /><br />Additionally, these bags are not designed to compress clothing, which is one of the advantages of packing cubes.  They are so formless and flexible that anything you place inside just bulges out (so that the cube ends up looking rounded and ""stuffed"").  This isn't the idea behind compression packing!<br /><br />Overall, I can't see using these tiny bags (they definitely seem more like ""bags"" than ""cubes"").  There are much better options out there."
2.0,These were way too big. They stuck out of my nose too much and looked extremely awkward.
2.0,"These looked cheaply made, but I guess that's what you get for the great price."
2.0,"I WAS THINKING: FINALLY I GOT THE RIGHT SIZE MASK, BUT, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED. IT IS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER MASK, SMALL!. IT DOES NOT COVER LIKE A BIG MASK SHOULD!"
2.0,Too big to be a crossbody. Not a leather feel. Disappointed
2.0,I needed warmth for my wrists. These are too thin so I will have to double up on the gloves
2.0,It was an expensive but it also looked very cheap. I just tossed the one I ordered. But the matching earrings are adorable
2.0,"Not what I expected.  Hoping for a stretchy scarf that I could wrap but is actually a tube.  The way the mannequin has the scarf around the head and neck is misleading, as the tube is not that big."
2.0,"I feel that personally the picture makes you believe that these gloves are a different style than the ones that you actually get. These gloves rip easily, they're thinner than most other gloves, and they just don't look the same as they do in the photos. Although they are black gloves if you want to do anything mechanical, or cooking wise, I would chose other gloves."
2.0,I have had this product for about amonth now and the strap had come off and ripped at the thread. I am very dissatisfied. This item is adorable and I was happy when it came. It is very unfortanate that I know have to look for a different item.
2.0,Wanted to like it but the mirror coating must've been cheap because the glare it created on the back side of the lens was ridiculous. Like no other glasses I've seen before! Honestly probably hazardous at night and other situations...putting light right back into your face if it manages to get in from the sides/behind you. Would be great in every other way if this was not the case!
2.0,Sizes run VERY LARGE! I got a medium and I usually wear an xl to xxl because of my chest being big...medium fit perfect so order down. But mine ripped the sides and I have to re tack them. Also the middle front area is coming un sewn after one wear in backyard by the pool...<br />I don't recommend green as it looks like scrubs at a doctor's office... Comfy though
2.0,"The material is very 'swishy' - as another reviewer pointed out, its like crumpling a garbage bag. I couldn't stay in them for 2 minutes, leave alone hiking for a day. Sure, they might be quick drying, water-resistant etc, but I am certain that other pants that don't make the 'swishy' noise exist and I will be buying those. In addition, its not possible to wear just these as they are too thin, you'd need a layer inside even in warm weather. These are going back."
2.0,"The bottoms straps were extremely tight, even with following the size chart"
2.0,"This is a weird t-shirt. The shoulder length is oddly long, even longer than the sleeve length. Love the color and design, but the fitting makes it too uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"I don’t review many items, but I feel inclined to write this one. A man clearly designed this bathing suit. Why? Because the placement of the bra cups is simply not at all where nipples are on the female body. Also, on the large the bra cups were tiny- like teeny tiny. Barely a nipple cover. And the band made it so you couldn’t really adjust the placement. And on a white bathing suit too you NEED bra cups!<br /><br />As someone who is 5’7”, 155lbs- I normally wear a 34D and a size 10/large bottom- the top was huge and the bottom was short/tight. I wish companies would do mix and match, because I rarely find people who are the same. The only redeeming quality was that the colors were"
2.0,"The tail is heavy and difficult to attach.  You will need to wear a belt with the costume to attach it, or come up with some kind of string or ribbon to wrap it around your waist."
2.0,I have very small hands and these gloves barely fit me. I was hoping my husband could use them too but no way!
2.0,NOT compression (even when sizing down). Thin material. Wish they were longer length
2.0,Wasn't a fan of this top.  It fit small and the pattern was overwhelming.  The material was scratchy and seemed cheap.
2.0,I ordered several pairs in different colors. and when they arrived they didn't anything like the picture. They were all messed up and even though they were my size; they didn't fit me. I shouldn't order things online when I can't try them on. Different companies have different sizes so I will stick to companies that I know fit me. I had to return them all which is a hassle.
2.0,"This coat is ok, but beware! It has two zippers and gets stuck every time you try to zip it. Not worth the headache whatsoever. Way too much money for such a horrible product. Definitely buyer's remorse..."
2.0,"I want to love this jacket, but I can’t get the zipper to work.  It fits great, super comfortable, just can’t get it zippered.  Unfortunately it’s going back."
2.0,"I was pretty excited about the look of this in the picture, but in person it actually looks really cheap and the metal bends a little funky when trying to fit it to your ear. Took about a week to come. Still cute enough when on and not worth sending back probably!"
2.0,Broke within an hour of wearing it. The fan that pumps the air just completely fell out.
2.0,Me queda pequeño.
2.0,Cheap material. No real pockets. Buttons cheap
2.0,"Received my daughter's boots today, only three aren't the boots I ordered. They look similar to the ones in the picture but definitely not the same, and the boots we received had been worn a while. The fabric is pilled inside, there were dried grass bits inside, and stuff in the tread. The black paint on the zipper pulls was also worn away.  I'm sure these are really cute boots and I wish we had received the real ones."
2.0,Not as pictured bcz it is too small and too short. The model must be a size 0 and 5’ tall wearing a large. Why don’t you make it larger and longer so Americans can fit it as shown in your photos?
2.0,This product is cheaply made and tight across the bust I am a 37B and bought an xl. I sent it back...
2.0,"I wasn't expecting much for the price, so I wasn't disappointed when they arrived, the quality is what you'd expect for the price. Very thin and hard material, that looks like plastic in real life (opposed to the ad photo). The sole looks to be soft and cushiony, but in fact its quite hard and noisy on hard surfaces. These reminded me of a grown-up version of old school baby shoes. Not at all comfortable,but good enough to wear for a few family photos, then into the trash."
2.0,"Fits as expected, but was received with stains on it fresh out of the package<br /><br />*Update: purchased in October, finally contacted by seller in April (6 months later) and issued a refund"
2.0,I liked the color but it felt kind of cheap and was too small for me.
2.0,Need better sizing chart
2.0,Design is cute and the size is good. However very slippery which is a huge downside for crawlers. Label says 77% cotton and the remaining mainly polyester which is very similar to other brand name socks I bought. Wonder the material may not be as claimed.
2.0,"Digs in on the joint right behind my big toe. Due to the material and stitching, there doesn't seem to be a way to stretch them. I've owned them for a few months but they have not &#34;broken in&#34; and I don't think they will. Not comfortable to wear but the price was better than TJ Maxx."
2.0,Perfect if you want to look like grandpa!
2.0,"Cute glasses, perfect size. Unfortunately the second day the screw fell out and we had to spend more on an eyeglass kit than the glasses!"
2.0,"Queda muy pequeña. Los filos no tienes buen acabado, la parte de adelante es en triángulo y se recoge."
2.0,Most of them would not stay up on my face. They kept falling down
2.0,Hinge is very to get. I'm afraid I'll break them every time I unfold. Lenses do not darken. Too bad bc I love the shape
2.0,"The product did not fit me well - it was the right size however, the fit was just not good."
2.0,Definitely not long enough. Came above my belly button. If you have a C cup or larger I would not buy this.
2.0,"I was looking for something comfortable yet sexy to wear around the house for my husband. For being a more plus-sized option, there was almost no stretch to this set, and the graphics started to look a bit weird while on. The fabric was also scratchy and not exactly the softness I was expecting for pajamas. Was returned."
2.0,"If you expect this coat to keep you super warm in cold winters, this isn't it.  It looks much thicker and fuller in photos than it actually is.  It's comfortable for the most part, but it didn't warm me up like I expected it to.  This is a good  fall coat, when it starts getting a bit chilly.  I am XL and I ordered an XXL, and it's still a hairline on the smaller side."
2.0,These are much bigger than advertised. They claim to have 50mm wide lenses but in fact the just the exposed part of the lenses are 53-54mm wide meaning the lens is probably about 56mm wide. This makes them far too large for my face. They're also super tall .. 48mm total height on these vs 40mm height in the genuine RayBans (new wayfarer).
2.0,"If u r big busted like me, 36DD, then this dress will not fit on top! I'm  a 6/8 on bottoms and med/lg top, depending on the style. The dress fit perfectly every where else but the chest."
2.0,Doesn't have pockets.
2.0,Runs super small and see through.
2.0,Liked color.  Size too small.  I returned it.
2.0,I wish they had bigger sizes.  I had to return the dress.
2.0,No where near as stylish as it looks in the picture. It looks and feels more like my grandmother's doilies and runs large in my opinion.
2.0,If a person is tall and doesn't need much compression (lose) these will work! Maybe my legs are too skinny and short? Didn't think of that...
2.0,"Not quite the nvgtn-type style as pictured. The leggings I received weren’t the “seamless” style as shown and have this weird line at the top of the butt. I looked through all of the products and any leggings with this kind of “contouring” weren’t even shown. I also ordered Navy, which I thought would be a stone-kind of navy blue, and they are 100% gray with a blue tint. Very soft, could be flattering without the weird contouring (which is what I had ordered), but not."
2.0,The cap looks greats. The red and white with the bold A...fantastic. However this hat is cheaply made. I think in less then a year it will be toast
2.0,"Too small, not what I expected, made of paper"
2.0,Thin material not worth the price. Looks cheap I wear as pjs
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it is not the standard 2x size.
2.0,This looks really cute but make sure you are wearing something under it. The fabric is very thin and you can see right through it. The joey also does not fit well in the pouch especially if you are moving around.
2.0,youth small is like a 10/12.
2.0,I ordered and received these recently and I really like them but have them adjusted to their maximum length and they are still not a long as I need them to be.
2.0,"Not as expected and it doesn't fit will as it shown in the picture, but it's ok! And the shipping fast was good."
2.0,"See through , very thin!"
2.0,Nice! But color look brighter on picture than it do in person. It looked more navy blue.
2.0,The cut on the shirt is nothing like pictured. It’s super short and then rounded in the front and back. Maybe would work if you have a short torso? Fabric was as advertise. Just a really weird fit.
2.0,I had the same problem another customer had - one of the ties was sewn on the inside of the suit with no way to get it out (short of taking the suit apart and re-sewing it).
2.0,"The top is cute, but it is not embroidered like I thought it would be.  The first one I ordered did not come at all, and I was not given a full refund, they said due to shipping.  The second one did come, but it took several weeks to come.  The top is cute and comfortable and fits true to size."
2.0,Teeny tiny!  I opened the package and had to second guess myself. The size chart is off. This will fit my average sized seven year old.
2.0,Size up in this dress as well as be prepared to wear something underneath. See through and small
2.0,The sizes are way off.  I ordered XL and it’s way too small.  I ordered a XXXL by mistake and it fits how an XL should fit.  These are sized for Pygmy’s.
2.0,Love the style but it looks like it was worn before
2.0,"Product details say terry cloth leading you to believe it's for after bathing. However, actual material is polyester which does NOT dry skin. So now my bath robe is a house rob."
2.0,Did not receive lab coat... scrubs are great
2.0,I got green and the color is the only reason I'm keeping it. I really like the color. I'll wear it under cardigans. The back bust area puffs out funny in both a small and a medium on me and the fit is awkward
2.0,Dress gave the body a boxed appearance. Actual appearance was very disappointing. Lace was too soft. Garment had a low budget look. Scallops on the chest and across the back did not stand up.
2.0,"It was waaaay too small, considering I already have a small head.."
2.0,"I'm 5'0 and 100ish pounds and got the smallest size I could get; xsmall I think. The sleeves were too long, the dress pretty see through, and the fabric not appealing. The dress also was pretty long, but I guess it's cause I'm short."
2.0,Done reviews said to order one size bigger so I ordered a medium instead of a small and it was too big. It's a boxy/wide shirt and I didn't like the style
2.0,Well made but not shiny glitter like pictures show. It’s “printed” glitter.
2.0,"I did not realize that the sweater was significantly shorter in the back, so I am disappointed there. Material is stretchy and, to me, very similar to bathing suit material. Not my fave. Also, the stripes are sewn crooked I’m the back, which is a little tacky looking.<br />Quality isn’t horrible, but overall I am disappointed."
2.0,"Cheap material , very see through."
2.0,"A little bigger than how I like my sweaters but some people like then really loose.  The reason for the two stars is that is was a scratchy material on the inside that was like a fake silk.  It's crazy when the softer side is on the outside instead of the inside.  I buy sweaters for style and comfort in Chicago winters.  This was not one, returned!"
2.0,The multi strand ones broke after a couple days. The single one still works but the attachment pieces tarnished after a week.
2.0,"The fit and cut were great, and the pattern and the colors were beautiful, but the material was HIDEOUSLY CHEAP. It looked and felt like plastic. I wasn't expecting high quality materials for the price, but it's disappointing nonetheless - I have bought other dressers from overseas sellers for the same price that were much higher quality."
2.0,"While these pants are very comfortable, the quality is unsatisfactory. After only two washings (on gentle, inside out, cold water, hung to dry) the pants are piling, and look like I've worn them for years. At the price I paid for these pants, I would certainly expect much better quality. I've written the company, and will post again once I hear from them. Hopefully, they will make this right. I'm attaching a photo so readers can see what I'm talking about."
2.0,"The wrong size was sent, unfortunately. I ordered a 2-3T and received a 12-18 month. That said, the romper was really cute and appeared to be made well.  The fabric is soft and seems to be sized accurately.  I wish I could make the 12-18 month work as it was a birthday gift."
2.0,"Thought I would try these cause the price was good, but these are cheap and the fabric isn't comfy.  See my pic of the waistband, the elastic is all bunched up and weird.  The color is kind of washed out, the pocket is too small, there are stitching issues and they run short.  For a few dollars more you can get a good pair of leggings from ColorfulKoala or CRZ Yoga for example.  So no, I don't recommend these."
2.0,"Very hard to use, I still have them and never once got them in my hair, now they are broken from overuse of trying to use them so much."
2.0,"Really wanted these to work but turned out to be just another poorly thought out and constructed item using the wrong materials.<br />So I didn't expect much, however didn't expect it to be as bad as I experienced.<br /><br />If you have to ride in rain or go through puddles etc. make sure to bring another set of shoes and socks 'cause your feet will get wet.<br /><br />Description says waterproof whoever wrote that either does not know the meaning or just basically embellished on a sales point or idea of one (lied) because these are barely for all but the lightest conditions water resistant.<br />They are warm as long as they don't get too wet so that is a plus. I have USA size 12 regular shoes and that appears to be the max you can stretch these over.<br /><br />Sure I should have known better water will pretty quickly soak through neoprene but there is a difference between soak and pour through.<br />All that white stitching you see, well you can see through and that right there makes these unqualified for even water resistant, in my opinion.<br /><br />Of course if you are selling these you will argue that is not the case, but facts are facts and too many companies stretch the meaning of both terms and in this case water resistant is even pushing it.<br />And really that does not matter in this case as they are promoting as waterproof which couldn't be further from the case.<br /><br />Fact is water will go through those seams like there is nothing there at all. The bottom part does at least in the case of my shoes make a fairly effective barrier for water splash anyway.<br />The zippers are not as bad as the seams for what it's worth.<br /><br />So if you are looking to just keep your feet warm on rides and don't expect much rain or puddles to be an issue should be okay.<br /><br />If you expect, or is common for you to go through any prolonged rain or puddles where water splashes all over, forget these you will end up with soggy unhappy piggy’s real quick."
2.0,I needed an apron that was good for grilling. This one is highly flammable
2.0,Nice material but to big all over except chest was to tight. Wanted to return but missed the window.
2.0,"Color was great , but product is mad of very thin material dosent fit as pictured more form fitting"
2.0,I purchased the white cover up with red and blue flowers and the material was cheap and very see through. I would not recommend this product.
2.0,"I buy and love Black Clover hats all the time. This hat was already ripped open and was seemingly dropped on a dirty floor. It was folded in a way that permanently deformed the bill. I’m not going to stop purchasing the Black Clover brand, I just will not get them from this source again."
2.0,"I would suggest ordering one size up in this item. Additionally, this shirt has a ""tail"" on it that looks super ridiculous. So you cant really tuck it at all to make it look normal. If you don't tuck it in, you have a tail from the shirt that completely covers the butt while the front of the shirt does not go past the waist area. My husband put it on and from the front it looked quite normal. When he turned to the side we both laughed and laughed and packed it up to return."
2.0,Missed the lightning deal by a few minutes but bought it anyway based on the product picture and description. That was a mistake. 6x4 mm is around 1/4&#34;x5/32&#34; which is small and one could find better packaging at a flea market. Definitely not worth it!
2.0,These are really cute earrings for a little girl.<br /><br />But buyer beware:  the picture and description posted for these earrings is inaccurate.  I only received two earrings that were the same as the picture.<br /><br />Worse - 6 of the 10 pairs were duplicates.  Assorted means varied or mixed.  I've contacted the company and will update my review if they fix this problem.
2.0,"These sandals are ridiculously cute, love the idea that they can go from water to the playground. My 4yr daughter was very happy with them, but wearing them she complained her feet were hurting, they rubbed the top of her toes & ankles. I had her fitted before purchasing & I am sadly disappointed. I did also email the company regarding my concerns & disappointment."
2.0,"I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in the result of this cap. I designed a logo for it on Photoshop, and I expected that it might not be absolutely perfect, perhaps having a framed square around it, (color mismatch) but it actually looks as if I printed my logo onto a piece of black electrical tape and stuck it on the cap like a black band-aid. Embroider designs may be better, but as far as a picture logo, NO!<br />The hat itself is fine though. I just wish the design looked more professional."
2.0,"I bought these believing they were going to be more like magnifying readers that change from light to dark in the sun, because in the photo they look like some I’d ordered before. However when they arrived the first thing I noticed was the very small half moon magnifying spot at the bottom of the lenses, while the rest of the lenses were of no magnification at all. In the photo you can’t see that feature in them. That kind of lens for me doesn’t work at all therefore I simply returned them as soon as I possibly could.<br />Otherwise they worked in the color changing part but the tiny (and I do mean tiny) half moon area would’ve quite simply been a tripping hazard for me personally due to the sudden changes in vision.<br />Otherwise the frame was really very pretty and they seemed to be very well made. The shipping time was quick and the return was seamless! If you can work with the half moon type glasses then I’d definitely say buy them; otherwise I’ll just say steer away if you dislike half moon readers."
2.0,Fabric does not look as flimsy in the picture.  This is REALLY thin fabric and very clingy.  Fits tight.
2.0,"The size runs smaller than advertised, mainly for smaller cup sizes."
2.0,"I loved the pattern on this shirt but when it arrived, I really didn't like the fabric. It feels like polyester. Not soft at all. The fit was okay but I just couldn't get over the fabric."
2.0,Cute. I gave this to my 4 year old who is tough on jewelry I will admit but the chain broke within the first couple of weeks of wear.
2.0,This blouse comes very small. Very disappointed.
2.0,The front of the shirt is lighter than the back. Design is very blah
2.0,"I don't care for the style, but the colors are good."
2.0,Not as wide or durable as the stock band. It does the job but looks a little off do to the skinniness of it. Over all it works.
2.0,Not well made. The glue attaching the crystals to the magnet detaches easily.
2.0,"Cons:<br />Lenses have distortion, either due to curvature or varied thickness of the lens. Significant portions of vision are blurry/distorted<br />Paint was already chipping off before wearing<br />Lenses were not fully seated in the housing - had to pop them in place and now they feel loose<br /><br />Pros: Styling and fit. Of 5 glasses I bought on amazon these had great fit and styling"
2.0,Love the style hate the fabric
2.0,"These look completely different from the pictures. When I opened the box I was immediately disappointed. They look very cheaply made, almost to the point of having come out of a gumball machine."
2.0,"These socks are super cute, but are not big enough at all. They are super thin. I’m pretty bummed because they are cute!"
2.0,small and very stif
2.0,This item is definitely not true to size. Large fits like a small and although the tags look authentic the print definitely does not. Not going to bother with return so I’ll let my bro have it but just order 2 sizes up.
2.0,"Although this tshirt was soft and design cute, I ordered a 2x and it was more like a large, sent back"
2.0,I’ve had to send this dress back twice. The bust was so big it wouldn’t fit and it gaped open. The bottom is also unfinished which takes away from the dress.
2.0,it was so thin mateial
2.0,These are not flesh tone.
2.0,Was not happy with these at all. The picture was prettier then the product.
2.0,The product came with a run on the arm and I didn’t notice it until I wore it. I pull my sleeve down and the fabric ripped open.
2.0,Way too big! Looks like costume jewelry
2.0,"It did not look like the picture and after wearing twice, the rivots came out and no longer able to wear."
2.0,I have bought from this same name and it's too small. Usually it's fine but this one is not fitting as it should.
2.0,Not like the photo of what you are thinking. It’s a photo copy on a mask. Disappointed. Giving two stars cause it came with a filter and will do the job. The mask itself is misleading.
2.0,"Nice cap but the shield is cheap, broke off"
2.0,Did not fit as expected. Too large in certain areas.
2.0,"After 5 laundry’s lost its shape and colour. I use an ordinary detergent and 30 degrees plan. For its cost, one should enjoy it much longer."
2.0,The colors are beautiful. But it runs a bit smaller than expected and there is a band at the bottom that I didn't know about that I don't care for.
2.0,Bought this to use at the outdoor public lap pool. I tried it on at home and looked really freaky. Haven’t been brave enough to wear it in public.
2.0,Tight and see thru especially if you have large breasts. I'm 132lbs and 34G bra size and I ordered large. Still too tight on chest.
2.0,Too small and rough inside so snags the scarf.
2.0,No size consistency across styles of the same size.  No guarantee that a second pair of the same style will fit the same way.
2.0,"I ordered L size based on the size chart and the fitting, but that was too small! And the seller couldn't help, just asked to return. Though the material quality seems decent, but SIZE should be properly defined! returned these."
2.0,So wanted to love this boot but don't. Will return.
2.0,These need sizes listed very large as the pic shows some ungodly long skinny talons in which moat women don't posses
2.0,"Cute socks, poor quality. My preteen loved them, but the stitching started to fall apart almost immediately."
2.0,The pleats in the skirt  fell out almost immediately. It ended up being more of an A-line skirt.
2.0,I was not thrilled with this swimsuit at all.  It did not fit right.  It is cute and it does look cute on the model.
2.0,This product was very large And wife and didn’t fit at all. The outside of the sandal is very flimsy material.
2.0,The earrings was nice but they don't lay flat in the ears so I won't be wearing them again
2.0,Awefully cheap fabric
2.0,"I mean, I only paid 7 bucks or so for them. Bought them for a festival and they lasted ONE DAY 😂 that was expected, I guess. Glad I got my gram pic before the lenses fell off"
2.0,"Beautiful sunglasses.  If I was going to rate on the look I would give a 5 star unfortunately the 2 stars are bc the are very flimsy. They drop down my nose as I bend forward. Falling off my fave.  And if you plan on wearing them on your head, that may be a problem bc they stretch. Tightening them will not help it’s the material that bends. I’m hoping mine are authentic.  For the piece I pays they should be! Bc I have never had this problem before with glasses.  Even if you have a big bead I still believe this will be a problem."
2.0,This dress is really nice but the picture doesn't show the same material as what is received. The color green is not green but more robin egg blue (aqua). I was a bit disappointed about that as well as the sizing and the lay of the part that should be flattering.
2.0,"The fit is a little wide, so it doesn't fit the chest area very well. Additionally, the padding that is built into the dress peeks out some which is unfortunate. Also, if you are tall, it is going to be extremely short. Overall, the dress just does not fit very well."
2.0,"The goggles were good at the beginning, but then it started to leak.  One of the side strips broke.  I bought two of these for my two kids and they both broke around the same time (lasted less than 3 months, used only 2-3 times a week).  Do not recommend and will not purchase again.<br /><br />Update:  Customer service was extremely responsive.  They offered a replacement or refund.  I selected the refund as I had already purchased replacements for kids.  If you read the other reviews and can't decide whether to buy or not, I suggest that you give it a try as the company offers a one year warranty and they honor it."
2.0,"Within one month of purchase, the strap was more than halfway detached, and the main zipper broke.. my second purchase of this brand,  didn't have an issue the first time."
2.0,This item is NOT as pictured. The closure is a standard watch clasp. The whole reason for purchasing this was because I liked the different type of closure and had high hopes it would be less bulky to fit under my boxing gloves at the gym. Unfortunately it will NOT work for that purpose. The material is comfortable and it’s not worth paying the shipping to send back so I guess I’ll just hang on to it but I am very disappointed.
2.0,"The material is not normal cotton. There is no stretch to it, tight fit"
2.0,"I didn't like them at all. Not as much spandex holding, as I expected., ☹️"
2.0,"Returned, did not  like."
2.0,Within a month of purchase the white stripes peeled off after a few washes.
2.0,"Not for people with big titties lol. The second you lift your arms, the entire thing isn’t adjusted to stay on your boobs, it completely moves up and you’re constantly having to pull the shirt down. I got an xl and I’m a 34 DD"
2.0,Maybe these are for 3-4 year olds but should they really be wearing masks?  They do not fit my 2nd grader and are not adjustable.  I wouldn't buy these again and would return them if i could.
2.0,"LOOKS good, but cheap terrible quality."
2.0,"After wearing them less than 5 times, there is already a tear."
2.0,Very thin and cheap material.  Lace at the top would not make it through a wash cycle.  Color was pretty though and it fit as I would have expected.
2.0,strings coming out of the zipper
2.0,"These are not intended for use in the rain or snow ( which is odd, since they are on the outside of your car and typically used in the winter). Mine sand to hold up okay in the short. Of time I used them, however.<br /><br />My problem, was that they do not stay put if you need to crack or roll down your window a bit. One of mine fell off 3 times. The 3rd time, I was unable to retrieve it, so I only have one antler now. I will not buy these again.<br /><br />I thought it would be easy to just keep my windows up at all times, but out of habit, I occasionally crack a window. If you're like me in this respect, do NOT buy these."
2.0,"It was cute, but very thin cheap material."
2.0,Way too small for my feet. The toes are very short.
2.0,I really wanted to love this dress.  But no matter what size I tried the sleeves were incredibly tight :(
2.0,Lost its pigment after 2 days.
2.0,"Cheap looking, not too happy"
2.0,Size is way small for a large!
2.0,I'm very pear shaped.  Calves about 19 inches.  These were a struggle to get on and fell about 2 inches below the knee... and I have super short legs!  I did all I could to pull them to my knees but nope.<br /><br />Giving them to my daughter.
2.0,These are not breathable at all. They are hot. I can only wear about 30 minutes. I'm dying after that and sweaty. It fogs horribly. It was really a waste of money since we won't really wear them.
2.0,To little and thin
2.0,Man these shirts are ridiculously small. I bought a 2x-large and it looks like a medium. If you ordered a medium it would probably fit a toddler. Shirt is unwearable.
2.0,"The design of this earring is really cute and looked great in my rook piercing. However, the metal around the jewels turned green very quickly."
2.0,La piedra se ve muy artificial.  Son más grandes que lo q se percibe en las fotos
2.0,"It's much smaller than I expected it to be.  It's for a gift and I was happy that it was sterling silver at a good price, but I'm tempted not to give it to her because the size makes it un-impressive."
2.0,This outfit was disappointing for me. There was no snap in the crotch area which left a big gap and my 7mth old grandson had it on 5 seconds before he had the bowtie pulled off.
2.0,it is cut very small and is not true to size.
2.0,"i am honestly so confused i remeber buying a white skirt and the sizing for that one was numbers, ie, 2,4,6,8 etc. but when i received it, it was wayy to small which was weird because i remeber i ordered a size up i came back to want i ordered and it was this. and i think it says i ordered an extra small which is not even close to true. even if i did order off this sizing system i would never order an extra small because i am not thin. idk i would just advise to order a size up."
2.0,The pendant is much smaller than spears in the website. I’m very disappointed. The chain was too short even with an extended so I used another chain.
2.0,"The material is cheap feeling, not what I expected ( I have bought many dresses off Amazon at lower prices and they had better quality). The under arm area was very loose but the neck was too tight."
2.0,Does not run true to size<br />Didn't  like  the material  sleeves were made of<br /> So be careful
2.0,Dress fits true to size and comfortable....however the material is very thin and see thru. I had to get a slip and wear a tank top with the black dress I ordered. I would not purchase again.
2.0,"Well, the picture looked purple with a black strap; the description says &#34;royal blue&#34;.  The actual bag is navy blue with a brown strap.  Was going to keep it despite being disappointed until I noticed the strap is torn (or not completely sewn) on one side.  Will be returning this."
2.0,Arms too small :(
2.0,I have two other pairs of telic shoes and they fit.  These are too big and I trip on them.<br />The other pairs are small and not small medium.
2.0,I'm trying to figure out how to return this product. I gave it to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. The watch is really pretty but right when my boyfriend started adjusting it the little pieces poped off and he couldn't get it back in. That wasn't a nice surprise :/
2.0,Tiny and flimsy plastic
2.0,"Overall I do not like this hat. Fit, size, and fabric are not what I expected,"
2.0,"Bought this over the summer. It’s very cute and stylish. By the end of the summer, the shoulder strap broke at the stitching. I used the hand straps until Christmas then those started to come loose from its hinge all the time. I put up with it for awhile but then it got pretty annoying. I was pretty disappointed. Didn’t make it a year."
2.0,The ruffles stand out in a weird way that makes your stomach look bigger. I can only imagine this looking acceptable on someone really thin.
2.0,It's too soft thin and saggy on the body even when I bought a medium. Not as flattering as it looks in the pic.
2.0,This bra is not made to hold DDD in place during jumping jacks.
2.0,The material looks  cheap on color  is alot lighter😕
2.0,"The pendant is nice even though the quality is not perfect and it looks like made in China when you look closer. The chain looks extremely cheap, I switched to a nicer chain and it now looks pretty. Overall, it looks really nice when I wear it on my chain but I wouldn’t buy this as a gift, as the quality is a bit off.<br /><br />On a positive note, the rose is 3D. I would prefer this pendant without the chain and of a higher quality. The stone itself is a cheap plastic.<br /><br />It took 8 days to deliver this to me, which is way too long.<br /><br />Edit: I had this less than a month and the gold is coming off. This pendant actually looks really cheap, I tried to like it and convince myself that it looks fine but it really doesn't. Every time I looked at it I could see a low-quality, China-made pendant. It is a WISH quality, not Amazon USA quality. I would return this but already threw out the chain and package. Considering this a $10 loss and do not recommend to anyone."
2.0,This was described as soft flannel. It is not soft at all. In fact scratchy and stiff even after a wash..very disapointed
2.0,"I had hoped it would adjust down to my small size, but it does not.<br />Let me know when its available in youth size."
2.0,They are okay. Not anything special. But over all not bad
2.0,Lower quality than the picture.
2.0,I do not think the 30x is correct as I have an 8x that seems to be as good as this one!
2.0,"the only good thing about this top is the color.  The fabric is awful.  I was expecting flannel, but instead it is a stiff twill and wrinkles easily.  The cut is skimpy around the hips, like it was cut for a man instead of for a women.  I returned it."
2.0,It broke the 2nd time I used it. Sad as it look beautiful . Since it broke so fast it was a waste of $.
2.0,It's tiny. Unreadable tiny. Very disappointed.
2.0,"I've been wearing home-sewn Olson pattern cotton masks.  They are comfortable but don't wrap the chin and hug the sides of the face as much as I would like. These really fit well. The adjustable earloops are a huge plus. However, the fabric makes them much too hot. Even with the adjustable nose wire which helps them seal to my nose better, my glasses fog up much more than with the cotton masks. I also find the inner fabric a bit scratchy compared to the cotton. I gave one to my sister to try, and she found it so hot she would not wear it out. I will be looking for some well fitting cotton masks."
2.0,It was very small for a size large!
2.0,Scratchy uncomfortable
2.0,"NOTE: The shoes don’t come with instructions. We ordered a black pair and one of the shoes kept flashing red while the other would rotate through the different options. We assumed the one shoe was faulty, so we returned the pair and ordered another black pair.<br /><br />We had the same problem with the 2nd black pair. We wondered if maybe we were sent the exact same pair we had just returned since it had been the last pair of black, size 13 shoes. We decided to try one more time.<br /><br />This time we ordered a blue pair, since there were no more black shoes in size 13 and for sure we’d know it would be a different pair of shoes.<br /><br />The 3rd pair of shoes that are blue, had the same problem. I decided to plug them in and just see what would happen if I let them charge for a while. After an hour or so both shoes were functioning properly.<br /><br />IN SHORT…when the light flashes red it means the battery is dead.<br /><br />If only there were instructions!! We could have kept the original black pair and not wasted 2 pairs of shoes and a lot of time we would have been satisfied.  We would have also had our 1st choice in color. Now it says they’re out of stock."
2.0,The colors are too light. It fits like a night shirt. It is amazingly soft though.
2.0,"The first time I wore them the seam started to come apart.  The fit was somewhat small, but not enough to cause the seam to come apart.  Looks like poor workmanship on the one."
2.0,Very pretty watch. Looked well made up until I put it on and it immediately broke. Im average sized so my wrist wasn't the problem.  It's fixable but straight out the wrapping this shouldn't happen!
2.0,Did not find this easy to wear or comfortable.
2.0,"The top was really pretty, but it broke off upon wearo it for only just a few weeks."
2.0,CUTE and nice fabric but non adjustable straps and too big! RETURNED\
2.0,They were small size for my husband. He said they were tight
2.0,What I received looks like the generic paper version of this dress.... there’s even an extra pattern on the dress I received versus what’s on the advertisement
2.0,They slide off the shirt too easily. Great concept on the adjustable straps but Velcro is a bit &#34;sharp&#34; against the leg.
2.0,Runs small! 2XL on 5*3 female at 110pounds it only went to my waist. Was snug and not rugged feeling material. Not warm and loose. Color is spot on.  But too short in waistline and necktag keeps popping up in back of hood. Poorly made
2.0,The product is beautiful! However there are two huge flaws in the glass. Unable to give to my niece for her 21st birthday tomorrow! Very upsetting.
2.0,Had to return very transparency
2.0,"I thought this dress was really pretty and it fit really well in the top. However, the pockets were placed in a poor spot and kind of bunched up instead of laying flat. It also was a little see-through in spots."
2.0,"I got these for my children, but it's just not practical for them lo carry the pads.  Rolled up, they are almost the same size as their sleeping bags.  We filled them up and laid on them in the house and they seem pretty comfy - good for the low price.  Unfortunately, we have to return them b/c they're just too bulky and heavy for the kids."
2.0,A little bright and thin.  Will use in warmer weather.
2.0,This product disappoints it very tiny and I can’t put on my ears
2.0,I ordered this because I've seen it on Pinterest and I found it here! I was so excited and then terribly disappointed. It wasn't great quality and didn't look like the picture. It ran small. I ended up returning it.
2.0,These sandals are a full size too large.  i had to return twice.
2.0,"The style is nice and fits true to size.<br />I am 5'2 140lbs and ordered Medium, however, the material looks very cheap.  It does not look like the item pictured.  I ordered 2 different colors and the red looks burgandy.  The blue looks dull.  I wanted to wear this for work but since the material is so cheap, it looks like something I would wear to bed. I'm sad because if the material was better, the color would have been vibrant and the style would have been so cute."
2.0,"To hard, my hands cramp up trying to use this product...I do use memory wire alot, but this brand much different...can't use..."
2.0,They don't look anything like the photo. The shoulder pads are totally flat. They look like there has been a concrete block sitting on them. I am very disappointed!
2.0,As expected but not my personal favorite
2.0,Another top that is too long for a 5'4&#34; woman. I could have worn this as a dress.
2.0,"The chain looks nice over a billowy shirt, but it broke after one wearing."
2.0,I didn't like it.  I returned it.
2.0,I expected them to be smaller and more adult looking. Very disappointed. Will never buy from them again. Cheap looking
2.0,Got these for my 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter to wear after her ears got pierced. They didn’t work bc they kept coming unscrewed from the back. My daughter tried them and same thing happened to her. They don’t use them any more
2.0,"The fabric isn't a knit, it's like Halloween costume material and thin.  I returned it ."
2.0,"Very thin plastic material. If you have small or skinny legs, it slips down so I had to tape it to my pants scrubs every time I use one. I noticed that after a couple of minutes use, the inside of the plastic & my pant scrub becomes very moist, my legs wet with sweat.<br />Better than no protection at all specially in this pandemic."
2.0,I've had to reattach and tighten the links each time I wear one of the chokers.
2.0,pros:<br />arm length is good<br />midsection is good<br />cons:<br />neck is too tight (bummed they don't have a option for a larger size)<br />way too tight around the back (lats and shoulders)
2.0,"Pretty, but I expected larger.  I guess I should have checked the dimensions.  Don't get me wrong, they're nice, just very tiny."
2.0,"It’s cotton material, not spandex. The orange color is nice and bright. It fits alittle big, because of the material, it seem some what transparent. Just not what I thought I was buying. I probably wouldn’t but again."
2.0,"Maybe it was just me but the first time I put the top on I struggled a bit... I'm a 36/38C and a Large top did not fit me AT ALL. Just when I though how bad the top fit was a joke, I tried on the bottoms which were so small they immediately resembled a thong. Loved the design but was very upset with how small it ran. I would never consider myself a 1X but with how small both parts to this swim suit fit thats the size I would feel I would need. On the bright side it shipped to me pretty fast."
2.0,You have to hold the light button for the light to come on ... and the watch is super small for a regular size wrist... I’d say it’s a kid sized watch... I know it was only 10 bucks but I didn’t expect a lot of functions just a regular size .. other than that it’s a simple watch and easy to use .. and the plastic feels cheap ... get the g shock bro
2.0,Very short. Would have preferred longer length
2.0,"The lower band fit fine, but the pin on the upper band was too long and wouldn't lock in"
2.0,Doesn't look great. I don't think I will use it often.
2.0,"The colors are very drab for the summer and it is way to short.  The fit is fine, it really was how short it is.  If I were way younger the shortness probably wouldn't be a problem!!!"
2.0,"Got a totally different pattern than the one shown. Like another review mention, smelled really bad of chemicals. Sending back."
2.0,Washed it once and it started coming apart. I loved the dress it got perfect but not a sufficient sew job.
2.0,"The material is fine, however, the inseam is cut way too tight! I have never had this happen with other shorts. No way I would walk around in these, much less exercise."
2.0,"I can usually fit a medium just fine.  However, while I could technically get this dress on, it was nowhere near the fit that it should have been. It doesn't work as a dress as pictured for me, but I'm considering using it as a top with skinny high waist Jean's with pumps. I think that would be a great use of this item."
2.0,Not a huge fan of these. They are super thin and very tight.
2.0,Poor quality. Buttons fell off after 1 wear.
2.0,Didn’t like the fit so much. To big in the hips to small in the bust.
2.0,It does not look like on a picture. Looks very cheap and it runs very small.
2.0,La calidad de las lunas no es del todo bueno !!  Pero cumplen por el precio
2.0,"The material is too thin, clingy, and cheap looking. Yes, I’m sure it will be comfortable like a nightgown, but not flattering or classy."
2.0,They are comfortable at first... but don't last. I haven't had them for long and already developing holes in the heals... looks like I am going back to a more reliable brand.
2.0,It’s not that the product is all that bad but when worn for couple days I found out it didn’t really fit me properly. It didn’t keep my ears covered because the face part is to open. I wanted to return but after reading the return instructions it’s most likely not going to be refunded and donated so I would have nothing. So I will not be buying anything from this particular seller again. I think you should be able to try an item out and if it doesn’t work be able to return especially when it’s Under Armour and it’s so expensive for suck a small thing.
2.0,They were ok but they broke easily and were still big for my 7yr. Olds hands
2.0,"I recently celebrated my 60th birthday, so I thought I would treat myself and any unsuspecting pedestrians who may happen to walk out in the street at night. My night vision has been less than perfect for a few years, what with the glare from street lights and passing vehicles making driving conditions unfavorable. I bought these with the hope of cutting down on the glare and maybe brightening up the night a bit. Now looking at the reviews, these seem to work for some people and not so much for others. I fell into the &#34;not so much&#34; category. They didn't brighten up the night nor cut any of the glare...just made the glare a little yellow. I'm giving two stars for the packaging and the glasses themselves seem sturdy enough. Just didn't work for me."
2.0,Seems to be made for shorter women. Pants not long like I thought they would be. Fits nice in the waist.
2.0,It fit as a medium junior size not medium women’s.
2.0,The pants are NOT high waist! The quality of the jeans are very very cheap for 30 dollars! Sending them back and requesting a refund!
2.0,"I was really hoping to like this sweater. In the picture it looks like a cute comfy sweatshirt. When I received it (18 days after I ordered it) it was a pure disappointment. The material feels like it should be used for a cheap pair of winter leggings. Not a good &#34;sweatshirt&#34; material at all. I would hoping it would be loose fitting and a cute comfy lounge around shirt. Ugh, I was wrong. This material is very uncomfortable, scratchy, and unbearable to wear. I ordered an XL thinking it would be too big, and I could shrink it but it fit like a size small. If you like cheap made sweatshirts this ones for you. I hate writing bad reviews, but I had to be honest. I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
2.0,Nothing like the material shown in picture. It's a mesh (see through type ) not cotton or what this picture looks like. Cheaply made.
2.0,Hard to buckle. Looks more like a grandma/Ortho shoe than in the picture.<br />Not too comfortable.<br />I returned them
2.0,"I bought this under the impression that it was rayon, but the fabric is definitely polyester: stiff and not breathable at all. The design is basically exactly like the picture, but the fabric was not as expected. I bought the one called 'red-2,' so maybe other dresses ARE rayon. Also, the fit was sort of weird, I usually wear a medium and bought this dress in a medium, which fit great everywhere except the chest which was too small and I don't have an unusually large chest. It wasn't too long. For reference, I am 5'3&#34; and a 34 D. It's a bummer that the fabric is so un-breathable and stiff because the dress is super cute otherwise. I'll have to return it."
2.0,Gloves appeared to be good quality but were way undersized.  I have small hands and the large gloves I ordered for my husband fit me except for the length of the fingers.  I had to return them.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of this dress (blue and purple) after seeing the great reviews... It's an OK dress but the material is transparent and does not hang very well, it totally clings and is not very flattering.  Disappointed."
2.0,One pair broke right out of the package. Still not a bad deal for the price.
2.0,Good quality cap but it was too short to cover head.
2.0,The padding is really bad
2.0,Not a scoop neck tank as pictured and arm holes are huge the rest of the tank fit true to size. Very awkward cut tank
2.0,Too short in the back & too small. Also the sleeves were too long
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:bd6bae3dc2ba0efc8ec1398b15a814ce]] The metal snap fastener on the AirTag holder were nice; it has the polished stainless finish as shown in the photos. The material of the AirTag holder was also molded to the shape of the AirTag and fit well/snugly (not just a flat pocket of material like others), which was nice. That’s about it for positives.<br /><br />But the rest of wallet is poor quality for the price in comparison to alternatives. There is NOT a magnetic closure, which I would really expect to be standard at this price.<br /><br />The branding name on the money clip, written in a random Notepad font, is tacky and doesn’t look good. Was kind of hoping it was an image watermark; it is not.<br /><br />The material of the wallet (whether it’s real leather or faux) is loose, and you can really tell when opening and closing the wallet. You can see this in my video. I’d be worried it would wear out or split open over time.<br /><br />Overall feels like a $10 wallet, not a $20 wallet"
2.0,The material is awful. Itchy.
2.0,"Order the hoodie 2 sizes up like suggested, still too small. Also a lighter material than expected"
2.0,"The zipper is not very feminine. It’s chunky and big. After one wash, it looks extremely faded out."
2.0,Only wore these twice and the zipper on one came apart and I can't fix it 😪
2.0,"It’s a brighter red than the pic. Sleeves are short. Fit like a tunic, not a dress"
2.0,No es como la foto
2.0,"Boot looks cute fits a little big but that's  ok. Packaging  was poor. The boot was placed in huge  Shipping  box with a piece  of paper over it, no tag on it and it has alot  glue. You can definitely  tell the bottom was glued on. It doesn't look durable."
2.0,"They are really small, the only plus side I can see to them being this small is that people are going to think they are real! Yaba Daba Doo!"
2.0,First of all. It’s clear to me someone ordered this and then returned it and they just turned right around and shipped it to me.  It was inside out. Bunched up. And no tag on it.<br /><br />It makes me look bigger and frumpier. And it’s clearly a very different material than the image used on amazon. Do not bother.<br /><br />I am giving it a two out of 5 however because even though it is not what I wanted I will be keeping it. It is hot 24/7/365 where I live and it is lightweight. And the pockets are nice. 🤷🏻‍♀️
2.0,These tote that they are contoured so you don't see as much light around the nose. These might work if you have a flatter nose or face but if your nose comes out from your face at all there is a ton of light that comes through. They also put pressure on the bridge of my nose that can be uncomfortable. It is a great idea in theory however the execution was poor.
2.0,"This bag looks nice, but its not a beach bag. You might be able to fit two big beach towels in it, if you're lucky. They should call it a beach purse."
2.0,The material is nice but unfortunately it’s so tight on me. I ordered a Medium. I will ask to exchange items for a large.
2.0,sandal is correct in size but the right side is bigger then the left. and its a pretty obvious to the fit. still waiting to see how it can be returned or switched out??
2.0,Material is satin-like. Too delicate and would snag easily in my opinion.  Sending back
2.0,Cute but very small. It doesn't even wrap around my skinniest of friends! I'm not sure if I received a dud or what. But I'm planning to give it to my younger cousin. Disappointed.
2.0,There were no pin for the watch bands only screws.  Can not replace the band with band pins and screws
2.0,My ears will react to anything that isn’t titanium. As soon as I put these in I could tell it wasn’t going to work but still wanted to give them a chance. After 36 hours I had to take them out and my ears were swollen and red. They’re so cute I really wished they worked for me.
2.0,"had a funny smell when it arrived. it's too small, I have normal sized wrists, but it is a little snug when on."
2.0,"Fits well, true to size. On the legs - nice fabric, compressing. On the bum - see through, ripped as I bent down to grab something. How unfortunate."
2.0,"I normally wear an 8 so that's what I ordered...unfortunately they were really snug, even with thin socks and I would have had to order a whole size larger.  Have to send them back;("
2.0,Thinness of material and size isn't right
2.0,the zipper dug into my leg
2.0,THe elastic waist was so tight I could not wear them
2.0,These looked perfect when they arrived but after the first wash/dry they shrank so much i cant wear them. I bought an xl and now they fit like a medium.<br />Maybe if you hang to dry they will work for you.
2.0,You do not get the color pictured or the waistband shown. Extremely thin material.
2.0,The size was super small and the cloth is pretty transparent.
2.0,These definitely don’t seem as thick/layered/same quality as other masks I have purchased. And one of the ear loops broke on the first mask my daughter wore. Probably won’t use these.
2.0,"I usually wear a small but purchased a medium for the loose, slouchy look but its a little big, wearable but bigger than preferred. It's very pretty, great quality & quite warm. However less than an hour into wearing it, the itching started. By the end of the evening I was so distracted & couldn't wait to get it off! I will try once more with a tank top underneath ( its way too warm to wear anything long sleeve under) hope my arms can stand the material. For this brand & the price I am terribly unimpressed."
2.0,much shorter then the picture
2.0,It has a screen printed logo that looks cheap. Do not recommend.
2.0,Bought these a while back and they just did not fit my feet at all. Put them in a pair of sneakers and had to undo them just to get my shoe on. The curse of having a high instep.
2.0,"dislike the print, I gave it to my Grandson for Graduation"
2.0,"These pants come wrinkled up in a ball in a plastic bag and have static cling issues. Overall receiving a wrinkled ball of pants is always a frown.  They are the right height for me though, which is great. Good for short people."
2.0,Pretty good quality of fabric but it’s absolutely huge on. Size down if you want to have any shape what so ever.
2.0,Loved the look and design but tore really quickly didn’t use it but 2 months
2.0,"Beads look very cheaply made, and it does smell bad for some reason! Not the greatest rosary in the world."
2.0,"I like it how it looks, but it is too big."
2.0,"I picked these up to replenish my stock - I like to keep glasses straps on hand for friends and family when I go to theme parks and ride roller coasters, you're typically not allowed to ride roller coasters with glasses on without these. These work well, about the same as ones I've previously purchased, and have a nice little shark design.<br /><br />However, a pack of these is *not* worth $29.99 though. You can purchase similar packs of glasses straps here on Amazon for a third of that price - just search ""glasses strap"" and you can get a 4 pack of sharkless straps for about $8-10!!! I'll give this product a star for having a little shark but the current price point is absurd!"
2.0,"This item fit me well, but had no shape. It was simple and would have looked great as a swim cover. I am 5'6', size12/14, 36DD. I did end up returning since it didn't fit with what I was looking for and had no issues."
2.0,"Not the fit or quality that I was looking for. Especially, for the price."
2.0,"within in a week, it was tarnishing.  I love the ring, but don't get it wet. I think it will tarnish regardless."
2.0,too small.  I don't have a large wrist but it's not a bangle bracelet as indicated but it's too tight.  I'd give it to my granddaughter but it's too old for her.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"These are pretty earrings. However, they arrived in a box with other items and one earring, just the snowflake part, was alone in the box.  I rescued it and then realized it had broken off the stud.  I don’t think there’s any way to reattach it."
2.0,looks a lot better on the image.
2.0,"Ugh. The material on the sweater I received looks nothing like the picture. It's more of a grandma old robe look.  Color (pink) was spot on, but sizing is off.  I wear a medium or large and deliberately ordered xl to get that cool oversized look of the model. Nope. Unflattering.  Returned."
2.0,"I thought this had was 31 inch Circumference,  but what I got was the 20 inch and it doesn't fit my head."
2.0,"Really enjoyed the style of the dress and the material did not look cheap at all, but the top button in the back was not sturdy. I ordered 1 dress and the button was missing so I returned it and recorded, but the next one the button popped off as soon as I tried fastening it. Due to the button not be reliable I would not recommend"
2.0,very large. well put together
2.0,Not as I expected. . It was leather but it was not the type of leather that I wanted. Service was slow
2.0,"These PJs wore out so fast, material already pilled after a few months and not a lot of wear. I otherwise love the fit, feel and look of them."
2.0,"I wear a 7 5/8 fitted and this fit perfect. A little cheap, flimsy and thin for the price. Better off investing in a Peter Grimm hat if you're looking for something more durable. Caution: My hat was shipped in a bag. Luckily it was only slightly bent and didn't get destroyed."
2.0,"Turn out to be not what I expected. It's thin 100% polyester.  the sewing is not quality, one button fall off after wearing one time.  I paid $16.99 and now they had to reduce the price to $12.99.  Not worth the effort and  time."
2.0,"Every time I try to hang a hat it breaks!  These were for a girls trip I was so embarrassed everyone I gave them to including mine kept breaking!!  Cheaply made, I waisted my money very disappointing!!!"
2.0,"I ordered the womens 8-9 and it is extremely large. More like a 9-10 which skews on the large size. I am an 8.5 wide - occasional 9 and these are a full size too large on me. I recommend going 1 size down. They are certainly wide enough for my wide foot and then some, so if you have narrow feet these probably are not for you unless you really size down. They are cute, but not sure how long I’ll use these due to the odd sizing."
2.0,Already trun color after 2 days
2.0,Did not fit well. Generic like one size fits all.
2.0,The bag was much smaller then i imagined. TBH it was as cute as it is in the picture but it can not fit much to be used for professional purposes maybe to be a purse but its small.
2.0,"This shirt is a great material, but it's huge. I ordered a small and it's massive..super bummed"
2.0,Yuck. It’s polyester. See through and way too small.
2.0,"one size fits all, yeah right. i have a 28&#34; waist. why can't they come out w/ 3 sizes? Small Medium and Large. is that too much to ask?"
2.0,"If you want something cheap to give away, it will not last"
2.0,"My daughter really wanted light up yellow rain boots. I found exactly what she was looking for. She loves the boots. The only issue I have is the left boot barely lights up. It’s very dim and I think only 1 color works. The right boot is great. I’m sure I could’ve returned them, but she found them before I came home from work and started wearing them. Oh well."
2.0,Meh. They’re too tight when they’re not slipping off.
2.0,"I order according to the size guide which was a large.  They don't come over my knees.  My mom is smaller then me and she got them on, but couldn't button them up."
2.0,Knee pads tore in first game.  We Bought for the protection.
2.0,These did not work well for me. The sun easily shines behind the lenses which causes me to squint and causes a terrible glare on the glass. I wanted to love them but in the end all I had was an eyeball headache. These just aren't good for bright light. I'm hoping I can at least keep them in my car for driving glasses.
2.0,The XL fit like a 2 or 4 usa.wish that it was in red writing to make it clearer that these dresses are Asian size and the XL=(2-4)
2.0,These fit WAY too small. Size chart is off. Get two sizes larger than needed.
2.0,After 1 month stitching starting to come apart.credit card holder seam not very well made. 3 months and I'm almost ready to order a different wallet from a different vendor.
2.0,Stickiness wore off fast.
2.0,"If you put your head size, they make it exactly your head size, or smaller. There is NO room for adjusting. There is too much cotton in one side, not enough in the other. I’ve tried it on twice to adjust stuff, and there’s already holes. It’s made for someone with an oval sized head, and only that. Pretty disappointed. It looks fine I guess, but add another 1/2 inch to your head size. Just really put out by spending 40 bucks on something that looks and is uneven, and feels bad to wear."
2.0,"Fits weird, has a weird strap in the back and doesn't look as &#34;worn&#34; as the image shows. I think I wore it once in public and never again."
2.0,"I wanted to love these, I really did. They’re really comfy, look great on, and overall do exactly what they’re supposed EXCEPT I’ve had two pairs and each one broke. First pair broke after about a week of using them and the second after about a month and a half. The handle broke off in both cases. I was very upset the first time around and was willing to try again and spend an additional $30, that’s how much I liked them. But after they broke the second time around, I gave up. Shame."
2.0,Started losing time in less than a month
2.0,"The size is too big, easy to go off, and looks silly when the glass is not very big."
2.0,Would have been great had a stone not fell out within the first hr of wearing it. Since then have lost 7 more stones :/ can't even wear it now
2.0,"This fabric is very thin. The sides are cut with scissors leaving jagged edges, however the material is so thin the ends curl up so it isn't noticeable at first. Not worth the price to me, returning. These can be made yourself for way cheaper."
2.0,Box was opened and missing one crown
2.0,"Returned this product after trying on and finding the product to be loose and baggy despite reading other reviews to accommodate size differences. It didn't hold the pump pieces in place well enough, meaning it was not a hands free pumping bra!"
2.0,"These are very cheaply made. They are also top heavy and you really have to put the backing on extra tight, really squeezing your ear, to make it stay properly, otherwise the earring turns upside down."
2.0,They are extremely flimsy and on of them arrived and wouldn't close so I can't even use it.
2.0,"Broke the second time I tried it on (never got a chance to wear it :( ) Guess it's true, you get what you pay for. Very pretty though (before it broke of course)"
2.0,First I want to say this outfits cute. I got a large it fit but the pants are not what I expected they fit very uncomfortable in the crotch area it’s like the stretch around that area stops. I’ll keep wearing them for exercise.
2.0,"Very poor quality, rough on the skin looks like a shirt you would get at a five and below store."
2.0,I had to return it due to some weird yellow stain on the sleeve-I’d also buy one size up or don’t dry it
2.0,"Will be returning. The front of the dress isn't rounded -- it is just a flap in the front at the hemline. Very odd looking. Also, go up a size if you want the dress to be loose."
2.0,Very dissappointed....stones..not real turquoise<br />Also...very small.....i gave to 7 tr.old grand daughter....
2.0,"Holds a lot of produce. Stackable and easy to carry. However, I've only used these twice and the lid already came undone. It doesn't zip up smoothly/easily. Totes would benefit from two zippers and tighter quality control."
2.0,rip easy
2.0,"Pretty top, but.  I normally wear a 1x.  I purchased a 2XXL and it fit much too close to the body, only flaring at the very bottom.  Returned."
2.0,They are cute glasses and the shades are very dark but they don’t fold and unfold very easily. I’m sure they will end up breaking in no time. They also come with a little card asking you not to give a bad review to contact them directly but there isn’t a phone number or email. I was told by Amazon they don’t have a number to give me that it’s some company in China. (Guess I should of read that before ordering)
2.0,It's okay. But cheap looking.<br />Really dont have time to return. So I'm probably going to wear once then give it away
2.0,The fit is great. Not the right color.
2.0,Pretty but sizes are off
2.0,Es incómodo el cuello además es corto
2.0,two small around waist
2.0,They look nicer in the picture than they really are. Still nice sandals though I was just looking for something with a rubber bottom
2.0,"The shiny bit rubs off, this is not really silver"
2.0,"This is way overpriced for a small piece of fabric, disappointed."
2.0,"We bought this for a high school formal dance.<br />Pros: The color is pretty and just as pictured. (We chose dusty blue.) The shipping was fast, which is a plus if you're in a hurry.<br />Cons: The construction of this dress ... something's not quite right. It feels like a costume mass-produced. Plus, the bodice is actually sheer. We had to purchase a camisole to wear under it. Then, that wasn't enough to remedy the situation, so we decided to send it back. However, the USPS informed me it would cost $44 to mail back. Ouch. I guess we have a very expensive costume party dress now instead of something for my daughter to wear to winter formal."
2.0,Very cute but definitely NOT for a newborn. It's way too big width wise. Closer to 6 months for width but 3 months in length. Strange size.
2.0,"VERY tiny. I tried wearing it on my ear, but I know I'd just lose it. It's cute and I'll make something else out of it, so 2 stars rather than 1. But for adult ears, it's not going to cuff the way you'd expect."
2.0,"It's a great idea, but just doesn't work as they say it does.  It doesn't light up until I've been looking for something in my bag for awhile."
2.0,The look and feel of it is great but the edges catch on everything. It’s ruined many a top at this point.
2.0,"The small was too big for me… I’m 5’7”, 135 lbs.  straps are not adjustable.  White is off white/cream colored."
2.0,I got the rose gold plated version...and its already worn off. Less than a month old.
2.0,"Quality is good, but runs too small. Also they delivered longer than expected"
2.0,These hoops won't last long... I had mine less than a year before they were completely tarnished... Just pay more for better quality.
2.0,Loved the saying but the jump ring broke after one wearing.....fixed it myself.
2.0,I usually wear a medium or large. This top in large was shaped like a big square. No shaping to it at all. Looked more like xx large. Even a smaller size could not help with the boxy look.
2.0,Too long.. and not velvet..
2.0,It took me a few days of attempting to put this chain on. The clasp is very small. I have been wearing it now for a week & it seems to be crimping up. Its now shorter & the pendant has turned around. I do not like it. Would not buy again or recommend.
2.0,"Cute dress but the fabric was shiny.  Unfortunately, I returned the dress."
2.0,Looked like a clunky tent on me
2.0,The fit was fine. I ordered an XL and wear a size 10-12 normally and am 5ft 6 inches tall. The problem is the elastic looks very old fashioned and hit high on the waist.  Made me feel frumpy. Going back.
2.0,"3 of tgem came broke, able to fix 1 of them, very cheap quality."
2.0,Not good for people with wide foot
2.0,This is a very small charm. Very disappointed in it's size. Have ordered others and they were a good deal bigger.
2.0,I got this for my niece.and the size i picked was good for 1 to 2 yrs old but i was disappointed not true to size way to small for 2 yrs old.
2.0,"The product shrink after first wash. If you want to take the risk,order 1 or 2 size up than your usual size. It's not a denim too.<br />Not too much happy about this purchase aside from other unwanted things I experienced with it."
2.0,Arm sleeves very tight and odd fitting
2.0,Soft but thin
2.0,Very cute - though quite a bit smaller than expected. Think pinky fingernail size. Picture on Amazon is the size I was hoping for.
2.0,"Bra is comfortable, but pis@ed they shipped a $68 bra wadded up in a tiny bag! Will most likely go back."
2.0,I bought these to replace another pair of Brooks Launch.  I ordered the same size & when they came in I put them away until I retired my other pair. HUGE mistake. I put them in this morning and they are a lot tighter in the toe box & overall than any other brooks I’ve owned (this is my 25th oair)  sadly I missed the return date by a few days so now I’m stuck with shoes I cannot wear.
2.0,"Nice hat, not a stitched logo but printed. White edge is lopsided too. Still like itthough"
2.0,"It's shiny like old time pjs and not in a good way, I got the blue hombre and the color isn't as dark at the bottom as the picture shows"
2.0,Bottoms are good. Bra top was way small for an extra large.
2.0,Pretty but a little tight
2.0,The tanks are not long enough. They're wide enough but the design didn't account for length.
2.0,They all came but the don't fit my nose
2.0,They are very cheaply made. Not near the quality that comes through in the picture. I’m really disappointed as they were going to be a gift.
2.0,Way shorter than appears in the picture.
2.0,Pretty but bad material
2.0,"My bust is 34"", waist 28"" and hip 39"" and the medium was very large for me."
2.0,Tight fitting shirt. Doesn't have much stretch making it uncomfortable. Colors are cute.
2.0,After a couple of weeks it turned different colors. Copper it looked like
2.0,Cheap watch. But looks nice. I didn't expect much for 12 dollars.
2.0,This is NOT low cut by any means. Looks completely different than picture shown.
2.0,Not as pretty as pictured.  I returned
2.0,They are not flexible and the large size as a bit small. I wear 11.5 to 12 size shoe and this large size is small for me.
2.0,"Looks nice, fits well, and I love that there are no animal products used.<br /><br />Unfortunately to materials used on the (non-buckle) end of the belt are very cheap, and the end is just a little too wide for some of my dress pants, meaning that it is very tight going though the belt loops, and within a couple of months the color is worn off parts of the end of the belt, which doesn't look good."
2.0,"Omg !!! I must have miss read the description. I thought I was buying adult size...super small , like for a 5 year old. Lol"
2.0,"I absolutely loved this dress when I first put it on and I had plenty of positive compliments, however after washing it I was immediately disappointed. The thread to the seem of the top of the dress started to unravel. I was on vacation and had to sew the dress myself because I didn’t have another dress option. I would return however like I said I had to resew the dress. Just disappointed because I really liked the dress especially because it has pockets."
2.0,"The watch looks great and runs smoothly.  But being a belt loop watch, it should be upside down when looked at. 6 pm should be on top, under the chain & 12 pm on the btm, so when it’s worn, and you slip your hand beneath it for viewing, you are viewing it correctly to read it. The rt. belt loop watch pic has the correct watch face position on it."
2.0,Nice concept but just too heavy. It is the kind of necklace that you are always aware of wearing.  The heavy thud on your chest as it moves about. The weight of the medallion pulling on the rough chain and irritating the back of the neck. Perhaps if the chain was less rustic and more polished it wouldn't be getting returned because always thinking of my family was the reason for the gift.
2.0,I returned this. Similar to other reviews the area on the arm that is a different color is much tighter than the rest of the arms making the shirt fit very oddly. It is too bad.
2.0,These are much darker in real life than they appear in the pictures.  Not the same as the movie.
2.0,"Loved the look of the bracelet, but unfortunately the charms fall off within the first week."
2.0,Colors are not as pictured. Much brighter. I ended up returning.
2.0,Too shiny and thin for my liking
2.0,It didn't look nothing like the picture.i was disappointed but still kept the earrings. It had looked like Diamond hoops on thepicture but when I had received them they were flat on the other side
2.0,Its cute but rubs way to big..I bought a large and it was hanging off me.
2.0,If you have problems with texture this towel is not for you. I put the towel on my head and it made my hair very dried out. Is this even a thing. Just something I noticed. I hate the texture.
2.0,"Not sure if it isn't more annoying than the bugs.  While the bugs do not bite, they still hover & buzz, making you swat and knock the hat about.  Always fighting with the limp brim of the hat."
2.0,"Pretty bummed, I've only had them a couple months and I'm already getting holes in the thighs. I really liked these too. I was about to order 2 more pair and then this happened. My Walmart yoga pants last over a year before thigh holes start. 😔 Super bummed..."
2.0,"I ordered these because I've had this type in the past. To keep it short. Not totally happy. I had to shorten both ends and cut the strap to get them to fit. These would fit a child perfect. The end pieces are cheap plastic and not quality rubber so I don't know how long they will last. The metal clips that secure these to your ear piece doesn't hold real well either. they did hold my glasses up on my nose but this is the first day. There's no swivel in the strap at any point so if you twist it you wear it that way or remove and fix it. Since I have 5 of them I would be ok for awhile. I went to Walmart and bought a better strap that won't fail when I most need them to hold. I would NOT buy these again, they are cheap but if that's what your after give them a try. The snap piece in center is very nice and handy when putting your glasses on."
2.0,"Not what I was expecting. I thought I ordered an off white cardigan according to the description pic. I got a white white sweater with a stain on one of the sleeves. The material is really soft but I don’t know that washing it won’t mess it up and I’m not gonna take the chance that weird dirt stain won’t come off and I’ll be stuck with a sweater I’m not actually satisfied with. The fit of the arms isn’t quite as roomy as I expected, but otherwise seems decent enough. I’ll be returning this for sure due to color and stain."
2.0,"I've had these for almost a year, but don't wear them that often because the posts bend easily and the backs need to be tightened before each wear.  They look good on, but I find myself checking the backs frequently.  I hate having to adjust/check on my clothing and jewelry - it's distracting.  I wouldn't recommend them.  If and when I need to replace them, I'll be getting a different brand and I'll be willing to pay a little more."
2.0,Just looked too cheap for me. I’m sure it’s fine for some people. I’m just kind of picky….
2.0,"Looks horrible out of the package. Bunch of threads loose that I had to cut off. Incomplete stitching one area. After a wash and iron and a little fixing, it looked cute. Still a tad small on my daughter who is pretty tiny herself."
2.0,Shouldn’t be labeled as tall. Big maybe but not tall. Ordered as a gift for someone needing. 5xl Tall! Sleeves too short and length hit right at the top of pants. Would return if I hadn’t already printed on the shirt. Huge waste of $40! Wont purchase this brand again.
2.0,"disapointed, three broke before I even put it on. The other three (double band, dangly, and star) are still awesome. Threw away three chokers, not even one use."
2.0,"The dress looks nice, but when you put it on there are a few flaws. My zipper is very poorly constructed and can't get past the waist band on the dress. It is a horrible design and zipper choice. Then, the back seam is sewn so that all three layers are tacked together which creates less poof and a wierd look as if the dress is stuck in your butt crack...not very attractive. The waist line was a little loose, so I had to add a black belt for more definition. I am 5'7&#34; 155 and ordered a medium. It was loose on me around the waist."
2.0,I purchased this because I saw a video of a very full breasted woman using the. This was not able to hold me up even slightly. I feel ripped off.
2.0,"I finally wore this over the weekend, and it was so tight, it left indents on my finger. I typically wear a size 5, and ordered a size 5. It didn't stretch for me and now the time is past to return. Disappointed with my purchase."
2.0,"It hung all wrong on me, had really flimsy material.  Returned."
2.0,Comfortable but looked lousy. Returned.
2.0,"The material on the pants was ok, however as you can see in the pictures, these are definitely not high waisted pants. I am 5'10&#34; 238 lbs, I usually wear a 16-18 and I bought the xxl. These were too tight and didn't fit well enough for me to keep, will be returning."
2.0,Cute but not soft at all!
2.0,"The shirt runs 2 or 3 sizes to small. I wanted to return and was told the shipping would be more than the shirt. I was offered 40% of the purchase price and thst was it , so if you are a small or medium size thus will work for you anyone else I would not waste the money"
2.0,Was to heavy. Returned yesterday.
2.0,The pants material is too thin and kind of see through
2.0,"I bought a size down but it is still way to long, especially for exercising"
2.0,They don’t hang freely.  Some of the tassel pop up randomly. And some of them were bent.
2.0,Way big on my baby. Came with a broken button on the chin. Cheaply made for the price you pay
2.0,"Very thin texture, not going to last long, had a hole on my socks on the first day I wear them, I was wearing a steel toe shoe,but other socks from store didn’t have this issue"
2.0,"While it is a stylish looking thing, I would have to say that it doesn’t do a whole lot of static busting. It does seems to reduce the amount of static a little bit but not enough to make it a must have item for me. When you get shocked it will show a red face for a few seconds but you already got shocked and don’t need this device to tell you that."
2.0,Bought size 2XL for son who weighs 210 and is long waisted. Not big enough.
2.0,Unfortunately I didn’t notice until it was too late to return but my product had rust under the metal parts that caused the suspenders to be discolored.
2.0,It looks fine but I've had it for some months and it doesn't keep the best time--I already lost one link---
2.0,They were too flat on face for me.
2.0,I ordered a size up from normal and the bottoms were still too small. The top fit weird and the quality wasn't very good. Do not recommend.
2.0,"These are so cute but dang my pinky toe would fall off if I wore them for more than 5 minutes. The strap is so tight and really hurts, and I don’t even have wide feet. Had to return them."
2.0,I will have to return this dress for a larger size.<br />It is also very clinging in all the wrong places.
2.0,"The front portion of the hat was too small, even though there was adjustable straps in the back. I'm unable to secure a good fit."
2.0,Needs drawstring at the waist.
2.0,They stretch out pretty quick.
2.0,"This night shirt is quite clingy and the material is almost see through.  Although the fabric is soft, it clings to you and is not comfortable for sleeping."
2.0,Shorts have no give in them very stiff did not fit at all.
2.0,The necklace is cute and I love the pendant but the chain is so cheap and rough that it literally ruined 2 shirts before I realized what was happening.  I could purchase a new chain but am super annoyed that it was so poorly made.
2.0,Loved the fit but the length was disappointing. I'm 5'4 and it was not as long as expected. One side of the dress by the hip poked out. Super weird! Nooooooo pockets! I bought...I conquered. But no thanks!
2.0,These shorts were offered as a color option on a pair of shorts that has pockets. Was extremely disappointed when these arrived and had no pockets.
2.0,"This product is silver, not gold by any mean"
2.0,Came apart after one wearing - not well put together.
2.0,Very very pretty but fit is tight and after two weeks my nose is green.
2.0,Loved the way these fit and looked on. But the mirror coating is coming off.
2.0,Bunched up looking elastic
2.0,Arrived with stud missing. Shame.
2.0,"They do the job, for the price paid."
2.0,"I knew that this bracelet was inexpensive and the design rather plain before I purchased it however I did expect to like it. I dont to be blunt. Mainly its the coloring. Its gold plated (at least its supposed to be) but the color is very brassy and nothing like my 14 kt gold chain. It may be the fact that the base metal, stainless steel is darker. Possibly. I'm debating whether I should return it. I'm not pleased. It looks cheap...."
2.0,"These are pretty, but I've had them on for two days and already one of the screw backs has fallen off (and is lost). I noticed when I was putting them on that only the very tip of the post fits into the back, and not very tightly. It's warm right now, so it's not like I was pulling a sweater over my head or anything (which is they only way I've ever lost a backing in the 30+ years I've been wearing earrings). Not happy, since these are essentially useless now, unless I purchase new backings."
2.0,Not very well made for silks. Plastic leaves.
2.0,"So of course this was going to be a cheap bracelet, it’s $15, but this is gum ball machine quality. It’s made of very light and flimsy plastic. I’m thinking the color is spray painted on. Anyway, it’s not worth $15. Definitely $5"
2.0,"The material was not at all what I expected.  This is more of a plastic coat not something I'd feel comfortable wearing. Folded, it has the bulk of a thin magazine. The stitch work was very nice though and the color was pretty. It certainly will keep you dry. It's just not my taste."
2.0,"The boots are cute and exactly the style I’ve been looking for. They are true to size. A bit clunky but that’s okay. Unfortunately the quality is pretty poor. I’ve only worn them three times and the sole of the left boot has torn away, almost completely. I will be returning."
2.0,"One pair is nice and soft, fb it's well.  The other two are rough feeling and the argyle one looks and feels cheap.  The snowflakes were nice.  Had a lot of compression socks, these are not my favorite"
2.0,I love the bright colors and graphic designs.<br />Downside...photos of products do not represent actual item.  I have ordered sevetal of these. There is one with a paisley desgn that appears to be small but reality is that the paisley design is at least as big as my hand.  Another has a smaller heart more towards the the upper left chest...it ended up being about 6 inches in size and positioned at my belly button.  If I was pregnant i might not mind but i dont really want to draw extra attention to this area.<br />Some say they are short sleeve and it ends at the shoulder-no sleeve and others end up being 3/4 length.  Not consistent.<br />Runs really small. Normally wear a lg but ordered a 2xl. Not much extra room.
2.0,To small even going up a size
2.0,"I ordered the smallest possible size, and it was too big and just plain frumpy feeling. The fabric wasn't terrible so I gave it 2 stars. I'm about 5'5"" and usually a little under 115 lbs. If you're relatively small, don't bother."
2.0,"The dress is very disproportionately made. I'm about 5'6, 167 lbs, breasts are on the larger side and medium back side that sits high. 😩 I ordered a large in blue.<br /><br />The top part could be adjusted to look more flattering but with my body type it's going to shorten the length of the dress that already falls about an inch past my cheek. The dress is very high in the back compared to the front. The material feels like aerobic pants and light. The dress itself, the seam between bust and dress had extra thread that if you tried to pull it would probably get a hole, if you burn it off would probably set the dress on fire sooo...it maybe cute on someone else but overall didnt fit my body type and it was disproportionately made in my opinion. I will be returning."
2.0,"I had to return this because--as so many other reviews have noted--it is NOT the Orolay jacket at all. It's made by a company called Jaslan, and it's not the same quality or the same style. Be careful when you're ordering if what you are looking for is the Orolay jacket; it's easy to order the wrong one...and it doesn't have nearly the number of pockets, and it doesn't have the same slim lines as the other does. I have sent this one back and ordered the other, and I'm much happier."
2.0,"The tie came in much more saturated in colour than the advertised image, lending it a much less refined look. Furthermore, the tie had the pattern sewn together in the exact opposite direction. Had the tie much more accurately resembled what was advertised, the make of it alone is disappointing. Stiff, scratchy, and attracts many fibres and hairs. Refunded my purchase upon receiving."
2.0,"I bought two pairs.  Price was good, but I'm not sure if I want to keep them or not.<br /><br />The pocket is cool vs. having one on the small of my back. I can actually grab things from it. Conversely, swimming in these is not an option as it creates drag.<br /><br />Not much support up front, contents will often shift during transportation. After my first km, or down dog, I need to readjust, and readjust, and readjust again.<br /><br />Not very compressive anywhere else (see above).<br /><br />Middling QC. I wondered why I was chafing the first time wearing one pair and found this extra length of serged seam. I cut it out, but I shouldn't have too.<br /><br />Either they will be going back, left at the cabin, or left in my gym locker. They will never be a go-to pair of shorts, and I wouldn't wear them for a competition."
2.0,It's poor!
2.0,Ridiculously small. Not bad matierial but I bought 3x and I take a 1x. My girlfriend is a large and it was way tight on her☹️
2.0,Tiny!  Returned and received refund
2.0,"Cheap, as you might expect. I stepped on the package and got a lovely hole pattern in my feet, and threw them away. Do not waste your money."
2.0,"I bought one of these about five years ago or so, and loved it. Thick, soft, and the perfect oversize. I finally wore it to the bone and wanted to get a new one that was more acceptable to wear outside the home. Not sure if I wanted an even more oversize or not, I ordered both a size 4x and 5x.<br />First of all. The 4x and the 5x are exactly the same size. I’d actually go so far as to say the 4x is slightly more comfortable for bigger people as the waistband isn’t as tight. Barring that, they’re the same size.<br />Secondly, the quality of the sweaters is completely different. I saw people mentioning that the quality shifts between the 4 and the 5, another reason for me ordering bc both sizes, but to me they were the same thin, cheap, scratchy material. Miles off from the great sweater I bought years ago. I’m unfortunately keeping one regardless (the 4X because, as mentioned, the bottom band is not as tapered and is more comfortable) but if I were more inclined, I would definitely look elsewhere. Very disappointed that one of the good options for plus sized sweaters sold out."
2.0,Necklace chain arrived disconnected! Hopefully I will be able to reconnect as is a Christmas gift.
2.0,"I was really excited about this piece, but honestly, the fit and look when it’s actually on, looks like the white tank tops that men wear"
2.0,"I found the fit of this shirt to be awkward.  I feel like I'm constantly tugging at it to adjust so the buttons are in the right place.  The color is beautiful, though."
2.0,The material is like the red Pennys you used to get in gym class to divide the teams.
2.0,"Way smaller than the 2X I bought, material is very thin, and it is not even close to size!"
2.0,"I got a pink Medium bodysuit. I’m 5’7” 145lbs. the straps were way too long, making the bodysuit show wayyyy more boob than I wanted it to. I eventually just cut the straps off the backside and tied them together at the top. Once I made some modifications I liked it, but the material is still slightly see through and I have a feeling this wont last me long"
2.0,They're cute but cheap looking gold color
2.0,Less than 1 month using these shoes and the heel cracked off and broke! These were my 2nd pair as I wore out the first over 6 years. Clearly the quality as gone way down!
2.0,"The previous reviews said that this had was sized big which is why I ordered it. They either fixed the sizing or it was just bad luck, but the size fits just like every other L/XL hat that I have ever come across, which for me is too small."
2.0,Unravels after a few weeks worth of use.
2.0,"You know the way that a Levi's (or any other brand name) zipper tucks right into the space at the top of the fly, just short of the button?  Well, this one doesn't.  You can stick a forefinger into the gap between the top of the zipper and the waist button.  And the fly, after washing, doubles back on itself, so that the  zipper shows.  I'll need to iron the shorts to correct this, and I wasn't planning to iron cargo shorts.  Side by side photos show wrinkling relative to a lightweight Target brand, and to a lightweight pair from a famous jeans manufacturer.  Same load of wash.  Add that there are loose threads in the pockets which will catch on your key ring.  I love the lightweight fabric, slim fit and deep pockets, but the fly is really irritating."
2.0,Cheap...flimsy...but I didn't pay much either.  Runs small.  Wouldn't buy again
2.0,Bad fit & finish!
2.0,"Wore them 1 time.  They are easy to breath through which is what I wanted but they don't stay on your face.  I want to use them for Covid face covering at work, but they slip off my face.  Everytime I turned my head or tried to talk they would slide down.  I will have to sew them and make them smaller if I want them for work.🙁"
2.0,i will not wear it. too shinny . and make me look bigger !
2.0,I bought for my 5 year old. She is always saying her hands are still cold
2.0,The steel toe kept rubbing my toe and I couldn’t wear them after about an hour
2.0,"Very cute but size is way off!! DD fits like a C or tight D. Also there is an error on the page, if you pick a size it will go into the basket as a different size ..my 34e becomes 34g"
2.0,"Works, but hat doesn't fit everyone well, where the speakers can fit over your ears."
2.0,"Not your every day wallet, it's small, so if you add small stuff then it's ok."
2.0,One of the earrings lit up for about 30 seconds and then stopped working. They look cheap but I’ll still wear them for tacky events.
2.0,"Very beautiful, but the hooks are definitely not flexible :("
2.0,Don’t buy these if your feet are size 12 or larger. The toes (and heals) are constructed so thinly that after only wearing them only 8 times large holes appeared in the toes.
2.0,"I mean you get what you pay for but this is a very boxy cut and the material is almost like a shower curtain. It is very cheap though, and pattern is cute. So if you can live with the material it's fine. Curious to see if it washes okay."
2.0,"Decent belt. It fits my Ferragamo buckle perfectly; however, the leather is cheap and does not last long. This is my second strap in 2 years. The quality of the original Ferragamo strap was subpar also. I wish someone would make a replacement strap using quality leather."
2.0,"short arms, largest size did not fit and I am a loose fitting large, returned."
2.0,The mask looked like the white walker but was blue if it would've been white would've been better. Returned item!
2.0,NOT ROOTS OF FIGHT!!!!!!!! Fits very small
2.0,"El proceso de compra, perfecto, la hebilla super, pero la correa no es de muy buena calidad, ya se me pelo entera y para cambiarla tengo que comprar otra y adaptarle la hebilla"
2.0,No me gusto el tipo de tela.
2.0,The front of the locket is only partially covered with the copper coating.  So it's partially steel grey and part copper.
2.0,They don't stay in well.
2.0,"This dress fit, but awkwardly. It was almost as if there was a twist to the garment. The upper portion was cut peculiarly."
2.0,Cute top. Nice material. But cut very very small. I order xxl expecting it to run small I wear a large and the xxl fit  more like a medium
2.0,"They look very cute , but they fit very snug- bordering on tight: run super small , I am 115# and needed a size large"
2.0,Absolutely loved them and loved how I looked in them however seam started coming apart on my backside which then revealed a underlying white stitch that was easily noticeable.
2.0,"I don't believe they sell this size anymore, but I am a 32DDD and I ordered the DDD size, and it was HUGE. It was funny because I've never had the problem of a bra being too big - it's always the opposite - but this was so big that I felt like I was trying to stick 32A's into a DDD. I used the 'Guide to Bra's', but I don't think that it's run by that company because my normal size was recommended.<br /><br />Regardless, I ended up not being able to wear this at all, sadly."
2.0,Ordered Xsmall but It’s like a medium size.
2.0,It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be
2.0,"I made the mistake of thinking it was three pairs, since each pic has 3 pairs in the pic. So I thought I was getting a good price. It’s not a good price. They’re decent sunglasses but you’re better off paying like $3/$4 at children’s place. IMO lol"
2.0,The smell wasn't quite what I expected but it doesn't last at all<br />Disapointed
2.0,"Cutest hat ever, and I would buy several more for our barn parties we host, but this is shipped flat as a pancake, all folded up and I tried to shape the fold marks out to no avail. Won't be buying this again :("
2.0,The shirt fit but the pants were short. I would go up a size
2.0,It is wider then it is longer so its not great for anyone with a longer torso to wear with leggings. The shirt itself is cute but not at all what I was expecting.
2.0,Poor quality material. Not well made.
2.0,"I love long, beautiful earrings. These were not for me. There is nothing wrong per se, they're just not that interesting compared to other statement pieces that I own, and it has nothing to do with the price point. I ordered both the solid rose and rose/crystal color. They came well packaged. The solid rose is noticeably lighter and overall nicer looking IMO if you are choosing between to two."
2.0,These do not fit well with glasses with thin legs.
2.0,"Fabric feels nice, lacing is chunky, just runs small"
2.0,"Nice stretchy material, am 34B and medium still feel tight on the bust but very loose around the band."
2.0,Too thin<br />Runs small
2.0,Was not useful at all
2.0,"Returned, sizing way off. Cheap."
2.0,Bought a pair of these night driving glasses and finally used them this week (I don't do much night driving due to the glare of other car lights).  They did not work as promised; difference was the lights were yellow and glaring rather than white and glaring.  Would never recommend these to anyone.
2.0,Cut smaller than anticipated. Not for busty gals
2.0,Broke as soon as we got it. My niece was very disappointed.
2.0,"This bra is not adjustable.  The straps were too long, and the cups were very stiff... not very comfortable.  Also, lace is not very comfortable against the skin."
2.0,"Good quality, would have given it 4 to 5 stars for that. But since it is running really small (see measurement tape on the pics) I can only award it 2 stars overall."
2.0,i sprayed my shoes with this stuff and a few days later it's as if I never did. May just be the kind of shoes I have. Probably works really well on leather.
2.0,"Pattern is cute but waistline is too low and bunches up.  )(Also has that vinegar-y stench.)  Looks a little better w/ a wide belt, but I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"It was a little &#34;Halloween&#34; looking upon arrival - too much orange.  Appeared much more coral on line.  Nice bag but too orange for me - had to return it.  Also, scarf was missing"
2.0,"Elastic rolls and twists easily.  Constantly adjusting. Very easily wrinkled within minutes.  For the price I shouldn't complain,  but I've already gotten rid of it after seeing it twice."
2.0,Bought these cause the description said they had pockets and they dont!!!!
2.0,Poor quality. Threads were unfinished on the outside of the skirt. I returned.
2.0,"Does not fit like the picture shows. I am returning it. The shoulders part only fits if you wear it off the shoulders altogether, the bust area is either made for flat-chested women or it's just not well-made (I would go with the ""not well made"" part personally), and it's short. Like ""crop top"" ""bares your midriff"" short. The model either is wearing one tailor made for her or she is short waisted and no chest. The fit of the shirt in general is not comfortable either, so the only way to smile while wearing it is if you're being paid to... like the girl in the picture. All in all, very disgusted with the top because I was really looking forward to having a cute top and I got ...... this...... ugh."
2.0,They are tight.
2.0,"This is a very brightly colored and  nice looking top. Iordered a size Small, it's HUGE....my guess is the actual size is a 14-16.<br />My dressmaker will be able to do alterations and make it about a size 8, so i will likely not exchange."
2.0,It fit initially but shrank to about 2 sizes smaller after 1 wash...really poor materials used.👎🏿👎🏿
2.0,"Maybe I have been so spoiled by Galvia brand socks that nothing else can measure up. These socks are thin and scratchy. They are kind of cheap, so what's there to expect. I would not recommend these."
2.0,"Worked great for about a month before I suddenly died . At first I thought it was a problem with the battery so I purchased a replacement, but that didn't work.<br />I'm guessing there's an issue with the internals.<br />Shame, it was fantastic while it lasted."
2.0,I'm a size 4 and this small is very tight on me
2.0,I'm fairly sure this hat is not authentic. The New Era logo on the side is not embroidered on the hat. It is a glued on patch that has started to separate after less than a week of wear.
2.0,"What an epic fail. If you want it long in the picture order the next size up. I ordered my true size the length comes to the hips and I'm 5'5. Not made for tall people.<br /><br />The quality is also cheap. I mean yes, you are paying 18 dollars, but come on! Thats the price of a quality sweater at TJ Maxx, Anyways, this would be perfect from someone below the age of 16, but for a casual sweater to go out in or to the movies, not a great idea. Wouldn't purchase again, plan on returning."
2.0,El material bueno y  color igual que foto solo que pedí M mi talla normal pero me quedo muyyyy grande
2.0,"It's going back.  I'm too short for this shirt and the sleeves don't allow me good arm movement.  The fabric is quite thin, and I was looking for something more substantial.  In it's favour, it does have discreetly placed pockets. It's just not the shirt for me."
2.0,"Too big and does not adjust smaller, only stretches to larger sizes.  Brim was creased and damaged during shipping.  Cape was attached off center so it came further forward on my face on one side than on the other.  I liked the material and the length and width of the cape."
2.0,Not durable at all. I had the bag for 2 months before it broke
2.0,"This is really cute, but when I got it one of the pins it came with was way too short. I had to take one of the pins from my other wrist band I had. It was super inconvenient. When I buy something I expect to be able to use it 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,You get what you paid for and since these were cheap they appear cheap and fragile.
2.0,Unfortunately this is already worn out after a handful of wears :(
2.0,"shrinks after one wash in cold water, definitely don't dry it!"
2.0,They seem to be staying up but Very thin.  I am wearing the white ones and I can see my entire front of my foot and skin and toes because they are see through thin.  I like thin socks but these are too thin. Not what I was hoping for.  not sure to give 2 stars or 3.
2.0,"Fits too high, 2 inches up from my belly button/ waist line. I'm 5'8&#34;, 125#. Got a US small but wished it was smaller."
2.0,This is really cheap looking in person. It didn't cost much though. So I suppose that's to be expected.
2.0,Overall I would rate higher but since one ball already broke I don’t really trust wearing the others even though they are cute and comfy to wear
2.0,This is not at all the size it says it is. I would order 2 sizes up.
2.0,"My son is 8 he wears a 10/12 ..i bought medium.. way too big, extra long sleeves.. color is vibrant & looks very nice. The material is awful. I am returning."
2.0,Made cheap and does not look like a swimsuit cover!
2.0,Well it didn't work out for my civic key fob key. Sticks out about a 3/4 of an inch and is annoying. Also the keys seem to dangle around when open and selecting a key. Definitely wouldn't want to be fumbling around with my keys when in a hurry. Also the buttons seemed hard to close.
2.0,Wrong color That's all.
2.0,Sizes have changed since I last bought it age and are not as comfortable because the sizes of changed
2.0,Great product BUT pop out easily and it’s kinda embarrassing
2.0,Seems sturdy but ripped after putting on for the first time. Other than it tearing on the mouth its a Very nice mask.
2.0,Size up a full size!
2.0,[[VIDEOID:c9553f7a246653a346b1b73ccd28600c]] absolutely no stretch and fits like children clothes . the jacket isn’t really sheer but definitely is cropped and the pants are like they’re made of glass . please please wear black undies . def tall girl friendly . I’m 5’6 and the pants are def giving 5’9+ so prepare to drag them in the street . besides all that the color is def there and it’s cute
2.0,Top does not come straight across. It shows outline of the padded top. I'm not real happy with it. It will stay on as I do yard work good suit to wear at home by pool.
2.0,Shirt does not fit anymore after one wash
2.0,I love the charm but the faux leather neclace is already broken! Would never buy from this company again!
2.0,"36 C, size large, too tight just on top. Quality was just OK,"
2.0,"At first it was amazing and I got a lot of compliments on it, but after 2 weeks of wearing it, the glitter part pulled away from the band and the band started to crack.  I had to superglue the glitter part down but that didn’t last long. For the price it’s good, but not for everyday use."
2.0,"dishonest reprezentation and quality.  not worth tbe price, no matter what it was."
2.0,Don't wear it
2.0,There is something inside that scratches my leg when I don’t wear high socks. I don’t want to start cutting stuff off but I think it’s on the zipper part. I thought since I wore them I couldn’t return them.
2.0,Fell apart after 3 months. Not worth it.
2.0,"Loved it when I got it - very sleek and forced me to prioritize.<br />Two months later, it is fraying all over - especially around the id window.<br />Very disappointed in the cheap quality."
2.0,The diameter is too small. I thought they were bigger
2.0,May be the expectation was a bit high. For $30 equipment the sound is really cheap. Always a mechanical sound is accompanying any music I play on it.  Cap material is also sub standard.
2.0,"I loved these shoes so much that I ordered them in silver and gold.  Unfortunately, size 5 1/2 (my normal size and the smallest they carried) was gigantic!  They were about 2 sizes too big!  As soon as I put the shoes on, I walked right out of them.  So sorry to have to return them."
2.0,I loved the different colors but I took these out first day trying them. It leaves this Nasty metal taste in your mouth. I never had that problem before. Trashed them and went straight to Spencer's Gifts to get some new jewelry.
2.0,This product is cute but the quality is poor.  the material is cheapo. Sorry to say that but is for real. I have to fix it after wore once. :(
2.0,Soy bajita y me quedo demasiado largo
2.0,"Huge, gave them to my 20 year old nephew who got a better fit from them."
2.0,"I had high expectations for this dress as so many reviews leaned towards being favorable. Unfortunately it was ill fitting. As some reviewers have mentioned this dress is not for someone with a large chest. It's not so much the lack of support as it is the placement of the straps that are not flattering. I am a 36D and the lines cut right across the boob area as well. The blue is a great cobalt blue but the nude under the blue doesn't work well. Maybe a darker color slip underneath.  I ordered a size xl and usually am a 14/16. It was tight around the waist, but there is a little stretch to the fabric so that may work for some. I will be returning this."
2.0,sent them back
2.0,Very cute but dosent leave room for my baby bumb to grow.
2.0,"Was not a sunshine yellow, was more like a dark mustard color."
2.0,Not good fabric at all. Very thin pockets that are a net instead of strudy pockets.
2.0,"I really thought this was a cute dress from the picture on the model. It just wasn't the best quality and such a tight fit despite getting the biggest size. The top is see through but the bottom has a small skirt lining. The material is very inexpensive so the whole dress will not last many washes. The design also fits very different if you have a bigger chest size. Overall, I would not recommend this dress."
2.0,"Not the best quality,it broke in less then a week"
2.0,It made me look wider. I didn’t like it and gave it to my cousin.
2.0,"These are very pretty in the packaging, but once you put them on they are very big and bulky and hard to tell what they are when your wearing them."
2.0,Somewhat small I would like mine a little bigger but these work better than the plan ones that you get a walmart
2.0,this isn't that nice.  fabric is hard.  didn't like it very much.
2.0,"I tried on this shirt in order to review it and was so excited, I love the bright pink color and the lace is so cute!  However, I went to button the back of the neck and...it's not possible.  So it's been sitting in my mending pile until I can add a loop or something to be able to button it up and wear it.<br /><br /> One thing I didn't anticipate was the top of the shoulders actually are overlapping lace and not in the armpits.  So - if you think of sewing the lace to an armhole - it's one piece from top, going down, and ending back up at the top.  I would have preferred the seam be in the armpit so there's not lace in my pits, but maybe that's just me.<br /><br />I also want to mention that there were fuzzy strings coming from a lot of the lace. I was able to cut them away but its kinda like stretchy lace that accidentally got snarled with velcro"
2.0,My son put his on and asked &#34;is this a youth extra large?&#34;
2.0,This nice cute but it’s skinny on body. Arms are little long but that’s fine. Returning it because it’s just to skinny on body
2.0,Very stiff ans difficult to put on a 3 month old.  Very cute though.
2.0,the are very cheap one try and they broke
2.0,Tight fit and I have a small foot 7.5 😑
2.0,The dress was very short. My daughter had to wear shirts underneath.
2.0,Showed up with one henge snapped off and one lens cracked down the middle.
2.0,For small wrists (6.75 - 7.25).<br />They should offer 2 sizes
2.0,It's cheap quality.
2.0,Was just a piece of glitter painted cardboard glued to a head band.  Lasted a week though. You get what you pay for!
2.0,"This shirt is definitely not as pictured. The shirt runs short, isn't as long as it shows. Stretch is good."
2.0,"The print was pretty. The fabric was soft for a stretch material. I'm a a pretty busty woman (46H) and it fit fine across my chest and back. The problem is it's not 29.5"" long. I'm 5'8"" tall. Barely came down to my hip and came nowhere near covering my behind. If you're 5'6"" or shorter and somewhat busty it would probably be fine. Anyone taller and small busted would probably be fine. But if you're 5'7"" with anymore than maybe a C cup steer clear. I ordered the 4XL. Hope this helps someone."
2.0,Item not as described. Very small and short. Photos do not represent what item looks like well. Seller difficult to work with and would not provide full refund.
2.0,The actual bracelet part came loose in about a week.
2.0,"All of the tank tops have the back straps attached way far out to the sides. So when I wear them, the straps in the back are under my armpit - they are not attached near my shoulder blades like they should be. So the straps are constantly falling off my shoulders. Its incredibly irritating. They are a bit too long but I still like the length because i like to layer and wear leggings. However if anyone is reading this and wondering about the length, I would definitely say its more of a slip length then a tank. I'm 5'6&#34; and it comes to about 5in. above my knee"
2.0,"I ordered an XL and had to return it. I usually wear a US L and thought XL would be more than enough. But i could hardly get in. My 12 year old niece fitted into it( who wears a US size 10), but had discomfort to sit and stand. Also the product came with a small hole in the cloth. So an overall, NO NO for me. I gave it a 2 star for the price and fast shipping!"
2.0,this strap I bought was for work for my safety glasses prescription style but it only lasted 2 months never buy again
2.0,Lol they feel horrible.<br />Shipped fast though and I will say you do get what you pay for. Seller is selling at a reasonable price. Good for maybe a surgery or occasional use. If you want comfort you have to pay a bit more. I've gotten great retainers off of Body Candy
2.0,"Dress is very cute on the model & I'm sure would fit someone around 5' pretty well... but the bodice part is very small on me, and the dress doesn't come close to the floor - I am 5'11&#34; for reference. Also as other reviews have stated you would definitely need an undershirt with this dress."
2.0,I got the xl gloves and they are too small. I can squeeze them on but they make my hands cramp. Then they are hard to take off.
2.0,"Ugh. I really wanted to like these. I know these are bombshell knockoffs and I can’t afford those. I’m 5’6, 36C, 28 waist, 34 hips. Pant size 6. Legging size small. I looked at their size chart and thought a medium would be a safe bet. Nope. The pants are tight through the legs but a bit loose in the waist. The waistband starts at a High spot, not compressing the mommy pooch. The top is too tight in the bust and armpits. Maybe a large would have worked better, but that’s two sizes up from my normal sizing. I can’t recommend."
2.0,Order two sizes up if you have a butt
2.0,Doesn’t appear to be quality of any kind. Doesn’t fit properly....
2.0,It is too small.actually my size is medium and i order larg but even it's still not fit
2.0,The design with the ruffles are nice but this dress was too short for me. I have butt and breasts and I wear a 14 and the material was too thin and the dress rode up because of my curves.
2.0,Coming apart at seams after a couple wears. Hasn't even been washed. Runs large. Is very warm.
2.0,"It's such a cute suit, but is sized way too small. I wear a size 3/4 in most jeans and I ordered a Medium. It wouldn't pull up past my hips! I would have needed an XL."
2.0,"They're adorable and seem perfect for indoor use, but they were just too difficult to put on, that it was easier to just not. Inwishbthey were easier to slip on, for being house slippers"
2.0,May as well thrown my twenty dollar bill in the garbage. The lower jaw and upper jaw/ teeth are super floppy/ flappy. This thing is super large as well so good luck with a tight/ clean fit. I think it was made for Cromagnums or cave men with massive skulls and jaws.
2.0,So i had to come back and comment again regarding this bag please be careful with this bag for I already have a hole in the inside pockets and thread coming out of the bottom of the bag . And no. I dont carry any sharp objects  in my bag for the hole to appear ..
2.0,"These do not work very well. I can get them on the band just fine, but the “claws” do not grip the band enough and it just slides off."
2.0,"Great price. Holds a ton of stuff. But, on the second week, the main buckling strap on the right side simple came off and disappeared while I was walking with it...gone forever, and now I can't buckle it around my waist. Also, there's not enough rigid padding in the back (the part that lies against your back), so anything I keep in the main compartment digs into my spine when I am on my bike. SO, having the main strap just come off (it;s not even anchored to the body of the pack!), is a deal breaker...the search for a reliable, reasonably priced tactical pack continues"
2.0,Demasiado grandes para las máscaras faciales. Son más indicados para cinturón o cinta de mochila etc
2.0,"Arrived with stained bottoms and stitching coming undone.<br /><br /> Fit s a little large in the size 14.  Bra cups were removable, but they were large for the suit/age range this is intended for."
2.0,"Looking at the photo, I thought the fabric would feel and look more like a very light knit.  It doesn't.  It feels more like inexpensive polyester. The sizing was also an issue.  I ordered a small which fit more like a very roomy medium.  It's long, but if you are between 5'4"" and 5'6"", it's doable with heels.  I just don't like it enough to keep it."
2.0,May Bithstone
2.0,I bought size 9-10 and they look 3T at best! They are soft but very cheap
2.0,The adhesive is too sticky and I ended up sweating a lot (not normal for me). This was less than ideal in my bride's maid dress.
2.0,It is too big and heavy
2.0,TOO SMALL FOR ME
2.0,It’s not bad but the dress felt<br />Like a windbreaker jacket dress. Ended up giving it to goodwill.
2.0,This would have been a great dress except for a big dull gray patch of fabric  that fell right over stomach that really ruin the look of the dress. I did not see this in any of the other posted pictures or I would not have bought it. Unlucky me.
2.0,"Not true to their advertising, I ordered an assortment pack but received all white."
2.0,not a good pair of work gloves - the rubber part - which would be the palm and fingers (as pictured) is not pliable - its very rigid.  it loosens up only a tad with the warmth of your hand but not to a point where it is &#34;true&#34; rubber - after working with these because the rubber is so hard it cracks and creases where your joints are.  it's better than nothing i guess but really the problem is the rubber is just too hard for it to make it a good gardening glove.<br /><br />hope this helps.
2.0,"I was super satisfied with the ""my kilometre"" swim trunks and that's why I decided to try the bib shorts. It's not the same case. There's absolutely no leg compression, just tight leg bands at the end. That classic cheap synthetic Lycra feeling. The chamois feels like a cheap plastic sponge. I would not recommend this not even for the beginners. Staying in my drawer and will stay there forever. If you already bought this and stuck with it, don’t hit the road with these… Stay indoors."
2.0,"I had no idea this shirt had that horrible lace stripe in the back. It's ugly and out of place with the rest of the design. And while ithe shirt fits, the hour glass proportions are off for me so the garment looks awkward."
2.0,I liked this scarf but unfortunately it was quite scratchy around my neck and really couldn't wear it for long.
2.0,Super stiff fabric and square cut neck design isn't for me though it looks nice on the model.
2.0,"So my issue is the picture makes this dress look black and purple but it is really navy blue, tan, and light purple..so the print was disappointing ...I guess I didnt notice anywhere that it mentions the colors in it...the dress is very comfortable but a bit long and loose fitting."
2.0,"First time laundered and it pilled. Very disappointed. However, I like the fit and appearance otherwise."
2.0,I should have looked at the picture a Little closer because I really don't like it being short in the front and long in the back just a strange look. And I guess the bigger your chest the shorter the front gets. 😝 If you have a tiny waist like me it's looks baggy in the middle.
2.0,2 stars
2.0,"I am not very impressed with these sunglasses, they are way too small. I think this would be better suited for someone with a very thin face. I would return these but I only spent $7.00 on them so it's not worth the trouble.<br />When these glasses came, there are no scratches on them and it come in a black pouch.<br />Don't think I will be ordering this again unless it was for someone else. Oh well, live and learn."
2.0,Very pretty but also not what I was expecting it's very very thin and I have a 3 year old a little nervous to wear it cuz I don't want it to break its a pen
2.0,"The V neck is sewn incorrectly and the dress was so severly wrinkled that its not worth dry cleaning. A regular iron would burn the dress. It looks like it was wet, then balled up and was let to dry in a ball. Its completly messed up"
2.0,A bit disappointed. It shoe isn’t that well made and looks awkward but great price.
2.0,"I am not pleased with this item. When the screen cover is placed on the phone, there are air bubbles that I am not able to remove."
2.0,"The dress is very pretty. However, I ordered the dress 4 times due to defects and there was something wrong with every dress. I finally got one that is fixable, but I'm not sure I'll keep it."
2.0,lasted a week and then the strap tore
2.0,"Hat looks similar to pics in description.  But it's a hat for small headed folks with no hair.  Barely fits on my head.  Wife made Tommy Boy jokes about them, ""Big man wearing a tiny hat"".  Laughter and mirth were NOT the responses I was looking for in a hat.  So rejoice tiny headed folk, you've found your trucker hat!!"
2.0,"Fit was nice but completely see through on top. Which wouldn’t have been a major problem bc I would have just worn a cami under, but there was a hole in the breast area so sent back for a refund."
2.0,I didnt understand why the hardware didnt come with key rings. I also wished that the seller would state no key rings.
2.0,It is pretty long. It could have been my choice if it was 10 inches less
2.0,Nike sign peeled right off after first week of wearing. Emailed Nike. No response
2.0,Edges of buckle sharp and hard to use
2.0,This hat was supposed to be powder blue not dark gray. We'll keep it but it was not what was advertised.
2.0,I love them so much.<br />What I disliked about them was the nose guard (plastic piece) fell off after the first time wearing them
2.0,"Weirdest fit. The middle part is sinched but only in the front, the belt loops are 3x the size of the belt so it just looks stupid. If the belt loops weren't there you could maybe pair with a large belt to off set the weird bottom which is pulls..... yeah just dint get this dress."
2.0,They fell apart after 6 weeks of having them
2.0,"bought this to carry my laptop and personal items like wallet passport and tickets for trip to Costa Rica.  the inside of the bag ripped, on both sides.  my laptop is a small 13 inch hp.  the only things in the bag were my kindle fire, my laptop, my passport and ID.  save yourself some money and spend a little more for a better bag.  this ripped on the way to Costa Rica, totally ridiculous.  and i got back to late for refund."
2.0,"At first glance, I liked the look of these glasses and was surprised they came with a cloth for cleaning and a hard case. I wish I could see through these but I cannot.  While they do fit comfortably over my reading glasses, they distort my vision with or without reading glasses.  Also, I see bright blue spots of light through them, which is extremely distracting.  When I told my daughter how disappointed I was in the lenses, she suggested I simply download a program for my computer that does the same thing these glasses are designed to do.  She told me there are apps for my tablet and phone, too - who knew? Not me... So I did.  I worked a solid day online with the new software that adjusts the light from the screen and my eyes feel great and I didn't need these glasses.  I won't bother returning them because I received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review and it would be more of a hassle to return them than keep them."
2.0,The fit is not what I expected.
2.0,"The band is nice and stylish. I have been using it for 1 week now and I have noticed some peeling. I don’t think it’s real leather. It is disappointing. The pictures attached are from when it 1st arrived. I work in an office at a desk all day, so it’s not like I have a rough lifestyle for it to get damaged."
2.0,"I'm pretty disappointed with how the band ended up fitting. The top strap fit really well, but as you can see from the picture, there is a significant gap between the bottom part of the face and the strap.  I can push the strap in to align, but it doesn't stay that way.  The screws in the back are tightened as far as they'll go.  This is going to bother me every time I look at it.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the band was easy to install, and the tools that came with the band were very helpful in the process. And, technically, it's still wearable and usable."
2.0,It keeps popping off
2.0,top is cut for someone with an A cup or wants their girls popping out the sides...not for me. cute print though
2.0,"I ordered a small which is my usual size. Occasionally I need a medium. This is too large in a size small. But I realize it is described as “oversized“, and it is! It is quite long, but I am only 5’ tall. Also, ordered the color apricot, but it is beige. Have not yet laundered. I wouldn’t recommend or buy again."
2.0,Expected to be larger.
2.0,Disappointed in the large size and found them to be to sharp to wear
2.0,was not a good style for me.
2.0,Turned a dingy gray after one was with cold water and color proteting detergent.
2.0,"Doesn’t fit my body style, hour glass figure. The pattern was beautiful, quality seemed good for price but just not for me."
2.0,Cheaply made had to return!
2.0,The color is deceptive. It’s bright hunting orange. Deer run away from me now.
2.0,"Fits a bit strange. Will keep it, but must fix. Very long sleaves and a bit wide at the hips."
2.0,"These panties are very good quality material and nicely put together; however, we need to return them because they run small. I have a very skinny 4 year old who weighs 32 pounds and a size 4 pant waist is big on her. We ordered the 4/5 and they are very small. They are also cut fairly high in the back of the legs with a narrow crotch. They fit more like an adult cheeky panty and I feel they would be giving constant wedgies."
2.0,Came with a REALLY bad smell. I am working on trying to get the smell out and hope it will clear soon.
2.0,I had to return these shoes. They had a really bad odor. Couldn’t take out of the bag it was so bad.
2.0,I bought these for a roaring 20's themed party and loved the length shown in the picture but they weren't that long.  Knot landed at my sternum and length after knot was half.  Quality was good though.
2.0,"Good size and like the style, Wore holes in them within a month of normal wear and tossed them.  I walk a ton at work though,  regular light office duty and you might get more life out of them."
2.0,"Bought the white color shirt. Was see-through, uncomfortably tight in arms and chest, extremely thin and scratchy. The shirt looks decent except for being see-through. Too tight to really work out in though.<br />Would not recommend. It's most likely a fake."
2.0,I wear a size 11 and ordered that size. They were to small.
2.0,La descripción del producto no coincide con la fotografía
2.0,The chest proportion to the dress size is way off as well as the pocket placement
2.0,What I thought I was buying what looked like green stone on the inside The Eye of Agamotto. Nothing is inside but glossy glaze clear coat not at all what I expected. No Green no light
2.0,"cute suit-pretty print, ect...-but weird fit. Just not for me."
2.0,"Was disappointed in the length. Not long enough for a labret or monroe piercing. I wasted my money. Although pretty, I can't use them."
2.0,"Wish the chest part was a bit bigger. Definitely not good for one who has big boobs. Other than that it would've been perfect! The ""V"" thing it has doesn't help also."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f78a315680311d13e97e2456b4bfc831]] Product it was excellent besides one of them was broken in the package
2.0,"Arrived quite bent. If the strap in the back were able to be cinched tightly it would correct itself, but the strap isn’t nearly small enough nor has much adjustability. Definitely would not stay on while running or if the wind blew."
2.0,"I should have paid more attention to the item description, because the boxing glove was way too large for what I wanted it for! That was my fault, but what I didn't know was that I would lose half of my money spent on this item when I returned it! If I had known that then I would of just kept it! The seller charged very little to ship it to me, but charged more than half of the item price to ship it back!"
2.0,Thin and oddly cut
2.0,they are very cute but they smell nasty and the metal used to clip it is SO cheap they break instantly and they are hard to open in general
2.0,Cheap fabric! Poor construction! Definitely a bad buy. Don't waste your money. Unfortunately I had to return it do I don't have a picture of how ugly and chintzy it really is.
2.0,"Whilst the bags pockets are designed great, it doesn't fit more than an iPad or small notebook, and after 3 weeks of use the bags inside lining is already ripping, so looks good on the outside but made poorly on the inside..."
2.0,Had to return the product. Runs small.
2.0,"For the price, these are outrageous. I was expecting a soft comfy long pant. No it's made out of weird dress pants materiel. The blue is so bright, they are very cheap looking for almost 30$. I mean forreal tacky. Maybe a different pattern would be better but I am definitely disappointed"
2.0,"The scarf is super soft pre-wash and it looks like a good quality piece of cloth. Then, I started handwashing it and I couldn't believe the amount of lint that came out of the scarf. I wouldn't want to use it after that, and so I haven't tried it on my toddler. After the flat dry, the lint still came out of the scarf when I touch it, ugh. I may just need to throw it away, unfortunately."
2.0,"I like this top-handle tote but after 2 months, the handle came loose in public and I can't find the screw-like attachment. This great purse is useless now, sadly. Do they sell those screw-like things that hold the handle on the purse?"
2.0,"I ordered up a size for bust, and fit, but the sewing puckered a lot messing up the look/pattern on me. Returning it."
2.0,love the dress however the large was returned for medium. I should return the medium for small but just haven't.  the dress is so cute just wish it fit better
2.0,"These ran small, and did not fit. I had to return them. I would consider sizing up one size for sure, but possibly two sizes, because they were that small."
2.0,Really cute shirt I really liked it like the first day I wore it. Then I washed it and the alien face got attached to itself and got all spotty and messed up and I was like dang it. And washed it again and the white of the face got black and dirty looking and I’m upset bc it’s such a cute face but it’s messed up now.
2.0,Bad lenses.  I just replaced my lenses today and the lense is far way different from original. It has some kind of double image/glare if thats how it calls when I am using it.
2.0,"Cute shorts, but the shirt fits oddly and has a very uncomfortable short undershirt. This fabric is seethrough and I’m guessing the undershirt is to fix that, but it only hides half my nipple.... Not wearing this."
2.0,"Socks look cool and it appears the material does not contain cotton so they should wick moisture away, but they do not fit.  I ware a size 10.5 shoe with a 14 inch calf.  Typically this is a L or XL compression sock, but not these.  I purchased the largest size listed  - the L/XL.  They are extremely difficult to get on and off.  Once on the fit is fine - good and snug.  The threads on the inside can catch a toe and you have to back up to get it on.  I found using the standard procedure to pull the top over the foot and insert toes at the exposed heel then pulling the top back over the foot almost impossible.  Then trying to pull the top down and back over the foot just s difficult.  FDX needs to do a little work on their sizing.  There were no reviews when I purchased this item.  I hope this review helps others."
2.0,"I purchased this ring to wear everyday. Within a week of receiving and wearing it for 5 days while hospitalized, the initial shine and beauty disappeared.  When I return home, I will begin the return process."
2.0,It ripped within a month
2.0,Me llegó roto solo que noe.gusta estar devolviendo las cosas después que la.compro.
2.0,Disappointed. The XL fits like a medium to me. I usually wear a large so I went up a size thinking I would have a roomy fit. It’s also short at the waist. I don’t like it.
2.0,Pensé que venían en pares y se ven muy mala la calidad del color
2.0,"Photos show white stitching, however, the bag's stitching is the same color as the bag. Not only is that a misrepresentation, but the bag doesn't look as &#34;quality&#34; without the pictured white stitching."
2.0,Purchased for my wife. very thin material. Nothing like the pic.
2.0,"The sizing was good but the materials felt rather cheap, especially the zipper."
2.0,Super big. Did not work at all for what I’d intended. Wasted money
2.0,"A week after I started wearing this band, it began to wear off. After another week, it's mostly white on one side. I have many bands for this watch and none of the rest of them do this."
2.0,"The size fit all thing doesn't work for this beanie. If you have ever had issues with hats being a tad bit too tight, this beanie will probably be too tight for you. Its extremely snug, and while it looks good, its just too tight compared to my other beanie which is loose, stretchy and very comfortable. I was hoping that this beanie was going to be like that, but it's not. I'll have to look for 'stretchable or stretching' in the description of beanies for now on, because this one was very tight."
2.0,"it's not really adjustable, if you try to make it smaller, it distorts the design.  and it wasn't exactly round, sorta oval shaped when it arrived."
2.0,"Feels good, however, one magnet fell out of the fitting. Had to glue it back in."
2.0,"The bottom of this kept crawling up, the sleeves and style just looked baggy and much more costumey shiny fabric than the image depicted. It really looks bulky until your arms are up and was not attractive. It also took weeks to arrive."
2.0,No interior support at all.. Had to buy inserts
2.0,Very pretty and soft but not nearly as long as pictured. I’m 5’9 and ordered an XL and it fit like a crop top.
2.0,Gloves are warm and comfy but run a bit small. Son usually wears this size but these are too small for him. I have much smaller hands and they almost.fit me
2.0,"Used for a month and a half, already tore where the strap meets the bag. Did not over load with weight at all"
2.0,Very cheap. But got the job done for a costume party. The “enamel”/paint wasn’t even inside the lines and poorly done.
2.0,These are really not worth $12 in my opinion. They're cheap feeling in both frame and lens. Too small for my 8 year old.
2.0,"First one wouldn’t stay on the desired heat level but kept fluctuating.  I sent it back.....Customer service was Johnny on the spot with replacement.  Second one will come on without my turning it on, but at least it stays on the right temperature.  I can’t recommend this brand."
2.0,"The material, looks like almost a plastic bag"
2.0,"I only tried one, others may fit different. Too small, bought for shoe size. Inside was “stringy”. Like the decorations they left extra thread inside sock."
2.0,Shirt is awesome... just runs too small
2.0,"I love these pants.  Nice material, comfortable, everything I want in a pair of pants for camping.  Except the belt.  Whoever designed this belt should be fired immediately and I'm not kidding about that.  It's total garbage, it's an S-hook that is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO UNHOOK.  When I'm camping and I've had a couple of drinks, it's a multi-minute process trying to fumble around and get the belt unhooked.  So you think, okay no problem I'll pull out the belt and use a normal, non-garbage one.  IT'S SEWN IN.  They took the absolute worst feature of the pants, something commonly replaceable, and decided to make it permanent for some insane reason.<br /><br />It's such a bad belt that I basically can't wear these pants any longer.  They sit at home in the closet."
2.0,No way to reset the second hand.  No accompanying literature.  Utility of adjustable bezel is not documented.  Would not buy again.
2.0,Helpful; but flimsy<br />And hard to separate
2.0,Too big.  Cheaply made.  I have much cheaper sunglasses that are way better.
2.0,Not much padding in the bottom and the zippers are difficult.  Also the front pocket zips down to close.  If it zipped down to open then you could partially open it with the bag upright and not have everything fall out.  That's just bad design.  The outside looks good is about all I can say for this bag.  Functionally it is just not that great and too dark on the inside.
2.0,Nice jacket but runs extremely small. An Clarke is about like a needy.
2.0,bot the best because the mouth of monokuma was huge across my face
2.0,Runs very long. I’m 5’5 got a large and it’s pass my knees in length.
2.0,Just o.k. for night driving
2.0,"Ordered Size S per the chart which should have been a little loose - nope tight.  At 5'4"" shorter than the photo but nice length. Color Wine is a Bright Orange Red. Material is a little stiff.  To wear off should would need to order at least 2 sizes up. Material is not very soft, may get better with washing. Sleeves were a little short on me and I have short arms (petite length)."
2.0,I love the look of the bottles but none of the spray nozzles work :(
2.0,"I was sent the wrong style, color and the xl was way too small.  I checked the tag because I thought the size had to be a mistake but it said XL.  I usually wear a large or medium but ordered XL because I wanted the long, loose fit for running but I think this was child size.  The return was very easy so I gave 2 stars."
2.0,Comfortable but does not stay up
2.0,"I purchased these socks for my wife for Christmas.  In only four months they are pilling up and wearing thin.  They are not wearing as well as I think they should.  Unfortunately, we are past the window of opportunity for returning them.  Thankfully they were not expensive."
2.0,I picked an XXL. It's very small. I always go bigger when purchasing from Amazon. But good grief. I wear an xl- XXL in womans shirts. I don't have a clue what they think is XXL.
2.0,This shirt definitely runs small but is also very seethrough. I tried ordering bigger than my size and it didn't help.
2.0,"I followed the company's measurement chart to determine my size. The pants were too large. The company nor Amazon didn't include any info in the packaging so I could return the product, so I'm stuck with them. The fabric was soft and attractive."
2.0,Was not dark enough
2.0,I loved this charm! It was perfect for me and adorable! however within a week the little moon had fallen off and was lost before I could attempt to repair it:( I dnt consider myself very hard on anything I own because my lifestyle is pretty easy going so I was a bit disheartened when it broke. I’ll be on the lookout for other cute charms with a bit more life in them.
2.0,It's a fit small but very cute.<br />The quality is as you'd expect from a 10$ product. So it's upto how you maintain it.
2.0,Cute but very uncomfortable. Couldn't wear them any length of time.
2.0,I just received this dress and it looks more Navy blue then bright blue. I have attached pictures for the color reference of my petticoat I am wearing under it to give the dress a little lift. I called amazon and I would have to return it and reorder it but since I need it for this Thursday I am stuck with it. Buyer beware of color differences and I read a lot of the reviews before I purchased it.
2.0,"Unfortunately these didn't feel right for my husband, the legs fit a bit too slim for him. The sizing of the pants is good, but he found that they were too close for his legs to feel okay."
2.0,I couldn't use these easy too small for an adult head.  Can't use if you wear eyeglasses.
2.0,Very cheaply made.  Item broke from the start. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Was so excited to order this dress! Very cute when it came but runs VERY SMALL! When i wanted to return I was informed it would cost more for shipping than the dress costs. They refunded me a small percentage& now I am stuck with a dress that does not fit!
2.0,"Just got these, and they have the exact same problem as Fruit of the Loom and Hanes briefs -- they don't comfortably contain the package.  To summarize the problem, the front is too narrow and the leg bands are not tight enough.  They are designed too much like women's underwear.  The waistband sizing is as it should be.  If I wore a pair of swim briefs designed this way, I'd be arrested for indecent exposure because my junk would be hanging out the side.  For this same reason, they are very uncomfortable.  The rest of the pack is going to the goodwill.  Hopefully, somebody else will find them acceptable because to me, they are garbage.<br /><br />I have previously worn Hanes and Fruit of the Loom briefs with no problem, but now they are wearing out and need to be replaced.  Hopefully, somebody out there has a decent pair of men's briefs.  When I find some that work after several washes and wears, I will buy about 50 pairs."
2.0,I didn't like these😕They are to big (I have a fairly small head and thin fine hair) for my head and slip off. They are also lined with fleece and I wasn't expecting that. I'm very careful and read review on everything before I buy. I hope this helps.
2.0,poor look and quality.
2.0,"Does the job, but really the product look like use.  :("
2.0,Size was small so replaced with bigger second time size was ok but cloth was small old
2.0,Material is very flimsy and almost see through.
2.0,"I purchased these boots on sale and am disappointed.  Even though I ordered a larger size based on what others said, my toes are cramped and my heel is too loose.  The boots are very stiff in the toes as well.  Hopefully that will change with time if I continue to wear them.  I am, however, 100% satisfied with the first and second pairs of Emu Ridge shearling boots I've owned."
2.0,I had ordered the two pack of these and they fit fine. I ordered the 5 pack thinking it would be the same exact bra and I was wrong. They were very snug and uncomfortable. Just goes to show the same item is not always the same.
2.0,The bottoms fit perfect but the tops are 2 sizes too small. I ordered a 24 month and a 4t and the bottoms were perfect but the tops small on both. I guess we can try to say they are belly button shirts? We really wanted more coverage though.
2.0,"very cute shirt, fits as expected. However the description indicates it is a poly/viscose blend fabric (65 poly/35 viscose) but what I received was 100% cotton. I would not have bought it if I knew it was 100% cotton."
2.0,Good looking watch but I returned it.  I bought the gold colored one and the band had a silver buckle. That’s a hard no.
2.0,This top would be cuter if the pattern were consistent all over or matched the picture at all.  Not returning because I’m lazy.<br />Mostly fitted and perfect long crop length. FYI this was “grey”.  Wearing a Med: 5’4” 120 lbs cup C for reference.
2.0,Way too small for any normal-sized adult.
2.0,This is not USA sizing. Runs very small.
2.0,I love these sunglasses and all the really cool accessories that came with them but I had them less than a week before one of the legs broke. I didn't even have them on I was holding them in my hand. The glasses fit comfortably and they weren't too tight so I don't think I put strain on them I think there was a hidden manufacturer's defect. It made me really sad because I bought them specifically to go to the Smoky Mountains and they broke two days prior to me leaving. I tried super glue on them but that didn't work either.
2.0,"Well, either they're not sticky enough on the ""strap"" part, or I needed a bigger size. They just didn't give me a lasting lift. I had such high expectations, but they just didn't live up to it."
2.0,I thought these earrings would be a lot smaller than they are.  I got them to wear to work because our mascot is a flying pig.  They are WAY TOO BIG to be professional.  So I can't wear them to work.  They are more of a joke earring since it is so large.
2.0,The top was damaged near the collar and the pant was too tight in fitting near the hips. Very uncomfortable to wear the pant and walk around. I am sure going to return the product.
2.0,This is a gift for someone that saw it on Amazon. Not sure if she will like it since it is dark orange with black. Looks absolutely nothing like the photo
2.0,"Ordered a large for kid .had to re order xl he is 5'6"" and 142lbs usually wears man med."
2.0,"While I was not expecting a high quality item, this is really cheap fabric, and the size is just completely off."
2.0,"This is nice, but not for humid weather."
2.0,Cute but flimsy. Broke the first use :(
2.0,"Very cute, but after having them less than a month the seam broke and I had to throw one pair away"
2.0,It's a bit loose on one side
2.0,Salió muy pequeño y no se ve de calidad
2.0,The band is cheap plastic. Only issue.
2.0,"Backs are loose and posts were smashed and bent. However, I had spare backs and the posts can be bent back. Met expectations based on price."
2.0,"It's for my granddaughter, but looks very flimsy."
2.0,i got one size bigger and it fits perfect its stretchy and moves with you. After about 2 months of having them the material is starting to get little beads and is super uncomfortable on the inside and then looks ratty on the outside
2.0,"Sized very small, quality of dress is not what it appears, and returning dress has been a huge hassle."
2.0,I would definitely recommend sizing up but if you have bigger boobs it probably won't fit because the cups are REALLY small
2.0,The frames are a perfect size however the arms of the glasses are standard and it squeezes my husbands head.
2.0,"So cute, but at least 10 beads have fallen off before I've even had a chance to wear the necklace.  :("
2.0,I had hoped the shirt would be more free flowing but it’s more tapered than expected
2.0,Muy ligero y cómodo . Color fiel a la foto. Compré talla S y me quedó perfecta.
2.0,I like the purse but the button on the front is coming undone already little disappointed in the quality of this one.
2.0,"Was excited when it arrived.  But then I put it on.  😒. Necklace was very stiff, did not move like a normal chain."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Cheaply made and very thin, feels like it will rip"
2.0,the bands not real leather. it just says natural and it’s a bit thin in width. the bottom band slides around and it won’t lock in but it stays in i guess. and the case is alright it does what it needs to do but i’d probably buy a third party band somewhere else. either way the product is okay.
2.0,Top fit great. Bottom not so much. If you have curves this isn't the right fit. I used the top with a different bikini bottom.
2.0,Will be giving this one away
2.0,"way too tight and the rubber material pulls on my daughters hair, she refuses to use it"
2.0,Returned. Looked better on others and I am a tall slim woman with big boobs/tiny waist. Thought this would work.  Color wasn't good in red--more of a muted ketchup color. Maybe would be better in black.  The bottom was strangely tight yet long. IDK it just didn't feel or look sexy on me and I am 6' tall. Why was the small feeling so LONG on me?  I liked some of the other dresses from this company much better on me.  No issue with the way it was made. Just not the one for me.
2.0,Did not like the low quality.  Sent back.
2.0,"As the other reviews stated, the fit is off, so I went with a small when I’m usually an XS in this brand which fits perfectly.<br />The small fit good in the legs but was too big in the stomach and kept creeping down."
2.0,The color is faded it's not black like the pic very disappointed
2.0,"The brown shown in the model is NOT the same blouse , there is no brown in the middle this look like a completely different one am very disappointed .wanted to wear it on my cruse matching my pants by the ground that SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE,THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT."
2.0,"Seem like very nice glasses. But they are NOT polarized. They even included a ""polarized tester"" sheet, which worked perfectly with my polarized sunglasses, but did not work on these. And holding these in front of my polarized sunglasses did not darken what was behind them. So if you want yellow-tinted glasses, these are nice enough, but do not expect polarization."
2.0,Went as Garth from Wayne’s World for Halloween. This wig worked ok after I cut it a bit. It doesn’t really look like the product photo. The top is very long and spiked. The bottom half is very straight. Would work best for a rock singer costume. The glasses were great.
2.0,I wore this costume one time and the print rubbed off where the belt and holsters touch the suit. The sword sheath did not last more than 15 minutes before the stitching all fell apart and left my swords on the ground. For the price I would not recommend.
2.0,"These were solicited as sweatpants. They are not. Advertised as having a high cotton content, these joggers were made with an extremely thin lycra/polyester fabric without any cotton."
2.0,Some came with the diamonds off or slanted
2.0,Glasses felt like you bought them at a $ store. Very cheap feeling and best fit for narrow/slim or children's faces
2.0,These pants fit correctly and are very comfortable. However the pattern looks nothing like the one I ordered and they are what I’d describe as “flares” rather than true bellbottoms. They are also a very thin silky material similar to a halloween costume.
2.0,I didn't like the earring metal doesn't appear to be black. It appears more of a silver color.
2.0,"It was nice but small. I'm 5'9"" and order a large and it doesn't fit"
2.0,Did not like the closure. Very hard to get closed. Also the lapis lazuli bead was very small. You couldn't really tell what it was. I returned it.
2.0,"Cute for a small gift, however the overall feel and look is rather cheap."
2.0,My grand daughter's birthday
2.0,mislead info
2.0,One month already faded
2.0,Cheap fabric and too short! Just blah. Sent it back.
2.0,"Loved this winder, but after 3 years, down to only 2 working winders.  Don't see how to get into the thing to service."
2.0,"I bought a size Medium and this is what I typically wear for maternity tops.  I found the garment very tight in the arms and shoulders, which is surprising as I have small shoulders and thin arms.  The fit was loose across the bust, which is to be expected as I am only a B-cup.  The dress also was plenty loose around the stomach and went down to mid thigh, so the fit was appropriate in those areas for a maternity garment.  I am 5'7"", 155lbs, and 6 mo. pregnant.  Unfortunately I can't wear the garment because the sleeves are so narrow, otherwise it would have been a nicely styled item."
2.0,"I thought I had ordered Navy blue earrings. When I received them, they were not navy. They were black and green."
2.0,Every pair had at least one earring that the post was too short and it was tight on ear and uncomfortable to wear.  I also received colors that even match each other.
2.0,Great price but many of the lights were duds.  I guess they were in the warehouse a long time and the batteries died.  That's why the great price.
2.0,One of the ears was unglued when I recieved them. So pissed. But whatever they were only like $2. But if you're like me & is easily dissatisfied by things like this I recommend not even buying them.
2.0,Material was cheep and the stitching has already started to come out.
2.0,Fit was good but I didn't like the material.
2.0,"The hat fits nicely,  the necklace broke immediately"
2.0,I was very disappointed to see that It's not screen printed. Just a stiff iron on decal. I Would not buy again.
2.0,"Used for reading and distance vision without getting prescription bifocals. Would work OK if the top of the lens was horizontal (true half moon) instead of a ""slightly flattened oval"".  Would welcome information in the Amazon forum where I could get true half moon readers."
2.0,"The size was way to small, I wear a XXL and my son wears a Lg and they fit him fine"
2.0,"The earrings are lightweight and are a pretty design, however when looking at the posts, there is some darkening. Makes me wonder if it is truly 14k gold."
2.0,"VERY small calves. I’ve never worn wide calf boots, but I actually needed help peeling these bad boys off. I’m not exaggerating when I say this, PEELED them off me. One of them I actually had to cut off, making it impossible to return, total bummer. The foot part sizing was just right. Tiny calves...order away. Anything more than skinnnnny calves , I’d order something else."
2.0,"This is like for a baby head, the wig is nice tho. Would look elsewhere if looking for a black wig though, no natural parting either."
2.0,"Look nothing like the picture, it's a cheap yellow plastic looking gold"
2.0,These are a good pair of pants for the first couple months. After a few wears and washes they inner thgh wears out and they shrink somewhat.
2.0,"We have been buying crocs for our children because they are easy to wash, easy to slip on and are comfortable to wear. However, this one pair was too tight on the top of my son's foot. He was so disappointed because he loves wearing Crocs, and I was disappointed, too. We bought this pair specifically because of the sides being closed instead of having openings where water and ants and dirt can come in the sides. He still slips the shoes on and wears them for short time periods because he loves the design and ease of the shoe. We are hoping the top will stretch a little and become more comfortable."
2.0,The sizing is sooo ridiculously off. I love the weight and feel of the ring. Just too small but says it’s a size 8
2.0,Poorly made - cheap junk! Save your money!
2.0,"Bags are very over priced for there quality, made from cheap material . I needed gifts and got them too late to return and but smth else that is why i keep them , small poor quality  would not pay for them more then 2 $."
2.0,"Comfortable material, but a bit snug around the neck. Huge arms, I could fit my whole body in there, unbelievably big! I returned it."
2.0,"This isn't a dress, tunic, or even a shift. It's so small it's barely a blouse! It's very pretty though, and the quality is good, but I'm only giving it two stars because it's not a dress like they advertise."
2.0,"Too small, but returned the small one and now waiting for my larger one to come in. Excited!"
2.0,It was a pretty good band. A bit tight in fit a hard leather
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for my ex's daughter. She was very excited to receive it. We paired it with other earrings (thank GOD) because this item was so below expectations.<br /><br />Out of the box, it was adorable. Squeals of delight. This is why I gave it any stars over 1. It really is cute.<br /><br />Why did we not like it more? Because.. well, at the time of purchase, there were no listed dimensions. No one had posted any at the time. We assumed it would be big enough for an adult ear, but this is NOT big enough. Neither of us could properly place it. Thinking it was at least metal, we tried to straighten the tail just a little to make it work... And the dang thing broke. Very thin layer of silver (if it's even true silver) and very poor quality metal underneath. It broke one more time when we tried to hook it over the ear as a sort of cuff.<br /><br />Complete waste of money, but it was very inexpensive, so I guess that's probably why. Don't get this if you have anything other than petite ears (adult petite to small moderate ears). Didn't bother to ask for a replacement because I figured it would fall apart as well."
2.0,I needed some temporary non-prescription glasses and bought these because of the frames.  Nowhere in the description did it say they would be blue light blocking. I compared them to a glasses I bought from Target that are also blue light blocking and you can tell the difference right away with the two. The Amazon one blue lenses are noticeable from different angles. I bought the Target glasses for $5 and they were cheaper and you can’t see any blue in the lenses.
2.0,Was not as happy with this. Looked better in picture. Will not buy again
2.0,"Not enough toe room, tight around toes.  I wear women's size 9 or 10 shoe.  I am 5' 10"" and overall weight is good.  Bought large/x-large."
2.0,"These are so perfectly oversized and the color on the lense is great, however it rubbed off after just two week of traveling with them. They're unwearable now because there are big black spots on the middle of each lense."
2.0,"This is seriously not worth $28! The cord is really thin and feels like a really cheap synthetic--very scratchy around the neck. When it arrived, it was already unraveling around the cord that attaches the pendant to the necklace. The cord is very, very cheap. If they had taken the money they spent on the little storage bag and gift box and spent it on a better cord, this would have been worth a little more. The stone itself was ok. Not polished the best, but ok. At only one inch wide, it is very small, though as listed. Make sure you note how big it is. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for something like this at the most. Not worth it. I returned it, especially since it was already unraveling. I gave it two stars since the stone itself wasn't that bad."
2.0,"I ordered my usual size, small and tight"
2.0,"Nylon material, loose and baggy and tight in other areas. Red is more hot pink than red. Probably returning"
2.0,"When i got it, it was folded into 4 folds and has not got its shape back. i have tried steaming it and trying to get the wrinkles out but its not taking shape..."
2.0,"FIRST AND FOREMOST THE SHIRT IS NOT BLACK!! I received a navy blue plaid shirt which instantly threw me off. I have purchased this to wear over a number of black outfits for a upcoming trip and sadly now I can't because it doesn't match. As for the fit I am 5'0, 160 pounds. Length wise it was perfect and it fit on the arms but it was just a step away from being too tight. It does say one size fits all but I would advise anyone with larger arms/wears bigger than a medium in tops not to buy it.<br /><br />Plus it isn't the right color. -___-"
2.0,"Runs small, and not flattering at all."
2.0,"Super cute and just like the black version I had EXCEPT that black from whatever I was either wearing or whatever it rubbed up against got transferred to the pink part. Otherwise, this bag would've been the best bag ever. Super frowny face."
2.0,"I wasn’t expecting top of the line, superior craftsmanship or high fashion but for 17.99 for a kids T-shirt, I expected better.<br /><br />The positives:<br />Received quickly<br />Looks exactly like the picture<br />Design/graphic is on front and back<br />Sizing appears to be accurate<br /><br />The negatives:<br />Seams don’t line up<br />Stitching is loose in spots & just messy in general<br />The terrible stitching makes the seams pucker<br />On a flat surface, shirt looks ok - if you hold it up, you can see right through it (and I mean RIGHT through front & back)<br /><br />Deserves to be noted:<br />Although I didn’t remove stars for this because I’m not sure if the description didn’t mention it, or if I just missed it… I thought the shirt was cotton or “regular” T-shirt material. It’s not. It’s that not really shiny, slinky, slippery material. I mention this for people that have a preference.  Personally, I can’t stand that fabric, and others love it."
2.0,It's cheap not real silver.
2.0,It does not fit like the picture.  Neck hole is small and the shirt isn't long as shown.  It's a box fit.  Wish I didn't miss the return window.
2.0,Super low cut
2.0,It's a little too big for a nosering
2.0,this was very small I think it was for a kid buyers beware
2.0,The length of the band should have been listed in the specifications because I can just barely fasten it
2.0,So disappointed... it has been broken more times than it has been together. It catches on something...broken. I think it has spent more time at the repair shop than worn. Going to look for something more sturdy.
2.0,Looks good but broke the second day I had it extremely cheap made
2.0,"I’m giving this two stars because although it’s a pretty set that you can wear separately, it turns your neck black along with the necklace. I had to scrub my neck and it smelled like pure metal. It was super annoying to do this every night on vacation because I didn’t pack anything else. I threw each necklace out after one day of use. You literally can not where it more than once.  I am not exaggerating."
2.0,Okay so. These shredded my ears and blew out my right one so bad I had to downsize to 11mm... that’s what happens when you use acrylic. Didn’t know that until I used these. My right ear was a bit agitated but it healed well. And I had my gauges in before this stretching for a year to prep for this size
2.0,"It is my arms that make this dress unwearable at this time. I bought it as an early graduation dress. I cant close it because I would fear it ripping. It fits the rest of me pretty good, but not my arms, sleeves are not giving."
2.0,Size ran much smaller than normal extra large items. Also material very wrinkled even after washing could not get out wrinkles.
2.0,"Like many straps, 'genuine leather' appears on the back but when touching it feels like anything but. Mistake in buying. I'll keep searching."
2.0,"This pair was a little disappointing, the fit wasn't as full or wide."
2.0,"I usually wash all the clothes before my first use (that is just how I am), and I do not know if this dress shrank or just it fits small...I think there are better and nicer things to buy out there."
2.0,These are not durable shoes
2.0,XL was too small for me and I’m normally an XL or size 16
2.0,It is pretty. But I bought this to b a gift for my future mother in law and it is just too small. And it says no where on the packaging or box or anything that it is diamonds. As a gift I'd like the receiver to know what they are getting...pretty sure I'm not alone in that. And the chain is nearly invisible! If it is homding diamonds you'd think it'd be a lil better. I know nobody gives a decent chain with any nice pendants anymore. But this one is ridiculous.
2.0,"Purchased the blue color. bag pattern is nice & &#34;classy&#34;, but plastic handles make the bag look really cheap. The original price is very inflated, so if you think you are getting a quality bag for a good price-think again. for the price it is a decent bag, but it does look cheap."
2.0,Okay for a costume but don’t waste your money for everyday wear
2.0,"Do not waste your money.  I am a women with normal size hands!  One size does not fit most, hand is very large and they are too short!"
2.0,Too small and ordered a size bigger.
2.0,"Second time Hide and Drink has disappointed. Usually pretty good, but this looks very cheap, leather has odd greenish tint, finish makes it look artificial."
2.0,Just not super flattering… and the buttons are not functional.
2.0,At first they are really good looking and charming but after som time the gold tone disappeared.
2.0,"Socks material is not for socks.  When you put them on, the socks are tight and the design disappears.  Not good when you need the top of the socks to show the pattern."
2.0,This is not the quality that Karen Neuburger sleepwear is known for.  The material is somewhat flimsy & the elastic around the sleeves is uncomfortable.  I removed the elastic & resewed the cuffs.
2.0,"I bought this dress as well as another on Amazon.  I thought I liked this one much more, but when I got it, I realized they were the same dress with very different looking pictures.  I was hoping that the skirt section would be long as shown in the picture and lay smoother as shown in the picture.  The picture from the other seller is much more accurate.  I've attached both for comparison.  If you like the picture that shows the more gathered shorter skirt you will love the dress.  I am 5'9&#34; and 120lbs, small chested, and I felt like it fit very frumpy and made me look pregnant."
2.0,These shoes run extremely small. I bought my son a size larger than normal and they still didn't fit.
2.0,"This is not sweatshirt material, as I was expecting and the fit is perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a bit short!"
2.0,This dress is for tiny tiny women. I went by the chart and got the extra large but it didn't even come close to fitting. I arranged for a return and the buyers were courteous and prompt. But this dress is not meant for anyone with a little behind or boobs bigger than a small C. And also it is very short and I'm 5'1
2.0,"worked good the first time i used after that the back ones would not stay closed on shirt, spend a little more and get one that wont break after one use."
2.0,Not what I expected. There are no tags on it so I can't even tell if I got the right size. It felt like it was on backward when I put it on so I turned it around and it felt worse so I know I was wearing it the right way but it made it uncomfortable. I am going to keep it because I have already washed it and I also wore it one day but I don't think I will ever wear it again.
2.0,Super cheap and see through. Mine felt almost like a hard scratchy fabric. Comparable to somwthing at a dollar store. Pretty disappointed :(
2.0,"Pretty bag, I just hope the terrible smell goes away! I wish I'd read the other reviews first warning about tge smell. I've been carrying about a week and it still smells terrible."
2.0,"I received the luggage after 4 days even though it was originally promised for a 2-day delivery. I even contacted Amazon twice because of it, and they promised it would be here earlier then the revised delivery date, but it wasn't. Then after reviewing the set, it seems very flimsy and it did not come with any directions on how to use the lock. Nor any product warranty information. It did, however, come with a TINY printed description of the product on a very small 3&#34; piece of card stock paper, but it's broken up English and challenging to understand. Can someone please contact me from Coolife ASAP with directions for the lock?<br />Thank you.<br />PS. I've boughten hundreds of items on-line, but this is my first negative review- ever...it's too bad."
2.0,"They we're crazy comfortable, but they pulled funny across the front crotch area which made it awkward looking."
2.0,Keeps coming unlocked and falling off!
2.0,I looked like it was totally streached out...
2.0,Nice if you're a size 4.
2.0,"Problem focusing with the lens. Loved the size of the frame, nice glasses. But just couldn't focus, this is the only polarized lens I had problems with."
2.0,Very pretty its a shame it broke on the second day.I put It  back together and it broke in a different place and cant be fixed.
2.0,I need to send back but not sure how... Was just gonna sell it and reorder. I like it tho just too tight on hips
2.0,Quality fabric and will probably reorder in a much smaller size. I followed the sizing chart and compared reviews yet still ended up being 1-2 sizes too big. I didn't want to order too small because these usually are tight anyway and also to avoid the muffin top effect. I paid for next day delivery because I needed this for under a dress I'm wearing tomorrow morning. So I'll be heading to Target tonight. Disappointed and inconvenienced.
2.0,Ok for walking. Definitely not a running bra.
2.0,"Love the cut of the dress, the fabric is see thru.  I bought this dress to chaperone prom.  I had to wear a scarf so my bra didn't show."
2.0,I returned this. It was too bright and bold for my Mom's taste.
2.0,Description should state the sizes are not accurate. I received size 8-10 (M) & it should be labeled as L or XL.  Way too big. Quality not very good (but very soft/plush feel as stated). Only been wearing 1.5/2 weeks and elastic in band is now sideways and rolling up within the waistband area.
2.0,"The shoe overall looks cute. Wearing it you can tell you’re getting what you pay for. It feels cheap. It also was at least a full size smaller than listed. I am tall with big feet, so i wear a size 10. They don’t make bigger sizes than 10 so I had to return not exchange. Pretty disappointing. Bought a different shoe."
2.0,Ran very small for size
2.0,Too tight. The waist is horrible and really unflattering
2.0,"These mask support frames do not work well. First of all, it's very stiff around your face and makes it uncomfortable. Then it's really too small. For an adult, it will fit just around your mouth and not on your nose at all. But it is supposed to be for a child. It is too small for a school-aged child. It ended up digging into my daughters nose and there was no comfortable way to position it. It does fit my 20 month old baby. But just barely big enough to go over mouth and nose. These are a no-go. Find another brand."
2.0,"is too small coming for china not cool i thught is american , always chines things is small even xl it has to be very very much bigger i have to return this to where china"
2.0,"The fit was kinda awkward on me and I never ended up wearing it. I bought it for my school's outer space day during Spirit week. I'm a little larger in the tummy area, and I just felt like the midsection cut at an awkward height, which made me look larger than I am. It would probably look fine on someone thinner."
2.0,It has a poor fitting and the cashmere lining isn't good enough. It tends to come out of the fingers when I try to take it off. Overall disappointed.
2.0,"These glasses are clear and protects from the side. The bifocal part was to large for me. That is the only reason that I returned them, They were shipped quickly and there were no problems other than the bifocal art."
2.0,"Buy another brand, you get less from what you pay for."
2.0,Looks like a plastic belt
2.0,This suit is made with cheap material like rayon. Legs were wide instead of tapered like pictured. Looks luke something my grandma would wear.
2.0,Material is not that stretchy or breathable. I order a size large than what I wear and it was skin tight. I was hoping the shirt would have a little more room. It's shame cause it is a cute shirt but it won't get much wear😕
2.0,fell apart after two days...if it was more durable I'd have loved it.
2.0,The size chart for me was not even close. I can see this on a smaller chested woman but not one someone who is larger in the chest area. I returned it and they were great and prompt with my refund.
2.0,"This dress was so thin you'd need a full length slip and cami and it still felt like you were wearing nothing.  Returned.  Blousy unattractive cut as well, but it was for my skinny 18 year old daughter."
2.0,"I was expecting so much more from the other reviews. These are expensive and the compression is just not there. They may work for traveling, but not for people that are on their feet 12+ hours at a time. My legs and feet hurt and were achy not even half way through my shift. I have other compression socks that do so much better for way less money."
2.0,Did not fit the size I ordered. Material thin.
2.0,very nice other than the fact that I sent them back because they hang low on the ear so you don't see the beautiful part you just see the connecting parts when you look straight on at someone wearing them
2.0,There were no damn thumbs!!! Just hand traps🤦 But they are warm and fuzzy!
2.0,Cut oddly
2.0,Purchased a small and it’s as big as a large. Weird cut and not very attractive. Gave it two stars because of the cute message printed on front. It is light weight material and good for summer days.
2.0,"That's right, I gave it 2 stars, but would still recommend it.  It's better than most (s-word) $40 vests out there.  It's cut for normal male body types (wider at the shoulder than the waist) but it is laced at the sides so you fat guys can adjust for your overindulgence.  All that said--the leather is leather you would expect to find in a cheap vest as are the side laces.  I've put about $12 worth of Obenauf's Leather Oil into it so far and it is softening up a bit.  I may replace the side laces because I'm afraid if I ever lay the bike down and go sliding down the road they may break and allow the vest to not stay where it will protect me.  Some may wear a vest to look groovy, I wear one to protect my hide  and keep my t-shirt from vibrating my skin off, so I want it to hold together in case of pavement surfing.<br /><br />Other good points (and the reason I chose this cheap vest) is the number of pockets, and the overall appearance is good.  Still looking for a high quality vest though. . ."
2.0,"Enchroma expects their expensive glasses to last 2-4 years with regular use. If you think that's normal then go for it. My frames started falling off my face after a year or so of use to the point they became more annoying to wear than not. When I wrote them to mention that fact they essentially said buy a new pair. So if you want to buy a new pair of $350 glasses every two years, these are the one for you."
2.0,"Pro: the small size is long enough for me (I’m 5’8”)<br />Cons: thin fabric (dark blue is see through), smelled strange (no way I could wear without washing first, but it’s not great quality and doesn’t seem like it would hold up well to washing), elastic waist placement was off on me, felt/looked frumpy and shapeless around waist.<br />I will be returning. It just looks and feels cheap and bleh."
2.0,Did not like this. It is really weird material. Like paper. Did not look nice on. Size small fit me really good but did not like the shirt.
2.0,Look like good jeans I ware 36 and had to get 38 and if they shrink any I guess they will be rages
2.0,"Not what I expected, it fits too small to actually go on my head. Maybe it will look okay on the back of my head...I don't know. It seems like more of a constume that I could get a party central"
2.0,Way way way big.....to my son's ankles! Is super cute with the dinosaur tail and feet etc. Is very thin but I've decided I like it. Can be folded up very small and comes w a little carrying case. I ordered the large for my 7 yr old and went by the size chart. They did refund me and I am ordering the small. Great customer service.
2.0,Thin and cheaply made.  They will work if it’s not really cold out.  Would not use in snow.
2.0,"Update...  Asset almost 3 months, the nose piece broke.  Great idea, poorly executed.  Lacks quality.<br /><br />Just received these yesterday.  I wanted something to always have with me and my regular glasses were such a pain.  A coworker has the name brand version, and while I thought they were goofy, the size was right.<br /><br />Function over form, I thought.  And the price was right, half that big the name brand.  Plus, I just compared them to the name brand, and they are pretty much spot on.<br /><br />I was concerned that the strength would be off.  I'm a 1.75 and I went with the 1.5.  But it is really good.  After I peeled off the protective film... The results were glorious.  No more asking my kids to read packages for me in the stire.  And no more bulky glasses cases protruding from my pockets.<br /><br />Pending the longevity, I will definitely buy these again."
2.0,"Fabric cheap, returning"
2.0,Unable to wear due to being too tight and I ordered an XL. I normally wear L. Not much stretch to it.
2.0,There is no way to tighten the strings.<br />Makes it lose on the foot.
2.0,"Great looking baby, unfortunately I used it twice and strap came off, not well made.  I only had my walker and cell phone in it, I was very disappointed"
2.0,"Very small and low quality, but customer service was super helpful."
2.0,Very poor quality-waited for almost 2 months to receive it.
2.0,I know that is a costume and shouldn't have expected much but im still really disappointed i read multiple comments saying that is an amazing costume (this is not the case). I was not corseted like the description states and the top is very floppy if that makes any sense. I would not recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice costume...  Totally not worth the money that I spent on it. Not to mention that the antenna's are basically a headband with pipe cleaners attached.
2.0,I have typical 38 inch waist and these briefs don't cover the back completely like they show in one of the pictures. It is more like a triangle than a trapezoid.I come to notice that this is the problem with not just this &#34;howe ray&#34; brand briefs. I am not wasting any more money on this brand.
2.0,"While I liked the look of this swim top, there were issues. I am small, 5'3, 110 lbs, 36B, and usually a small is just right. This, however, was too big with no way to make it any smaller nor could I exchange for a smaller size. I was disappointed, especially after waiting over 2 weeks to receive it. I didn't know it was coming from China."
2.0,"The elastic stretches too much, causing the straps to fall."
2.0,I love the color and the fit is good. The stones look much bigger online. This ring is very small and lightweight.
2.0,My husbands boots are huge and never dry all the way to the toe. I had hopes that this boot dryer would fix that problem with its telescoping arms but no matter which position I tried the toes of the boots stayed cold and wet.  The dryer has one rotating dial.  I was only able to turn it up halfway because the unit got so hot that I was afraid it would catch on fire.  This happened with the boots on the arms and without.<br /><br />The boot dryer is very quiet and does put out a good amount of air but may be better for smaller shoes or even children's sizes.
2.0,"Fabric feels wonderful, but I measured myself and ordered according to the size chart and it was way, way too small. I am 5'3"" about 160 lbs usually wear size 8 or 10 in US sizing and the Large was so small I couldn't get it over my hips."
2.0,This is way too big for a cartilage piercing in my opinion.
2.0,"I like the materials. The bottoms are true to size, only the top is way too small. If your bust is 34, get the 36 or 38 bust size. But then the bottoms are gonna be too big for your butt to handle. I don't like returning stuff coz it's a stressful process for me"
2.0,"They run pretty large. They also poofed out a lot; even if I had ordered a smaller size or if my legs were bigger, they still would have looked weird."
2.0,The look is really pretty but terrible quality. As soon as I tried it on one button fell off. Didn’t get to fix then went to try it on again another day and the other fell off. Now I have to fix one loop and 2 buttons. Not impressed.
2.0,"The material is too thin. The picture is not from this company, I’m pretty sure it come from Pretty Little Thing. They look and feel like costume pants. It’s alright for the price. But it also took a month+ to get here"
2.0,It is too small for me :(
2.0,"I am 5'3, 130lbs, 27 inch waist and 38 inch hips and ordered a small. I should have ordered a medium. I have thick thighs so the fabric stretches and becomes sheerer over my thighs and you can see my underwear so I have keep them covered. I will attach a picture with the leggings in front of a window and you can see the shadow of the pattern from the back side. The stitching is not strong as I can see in areas it stretch and pull apart on the butt seam and around the waist after trying them on and wearing them twice. Its the silky, slinky feeling material so they are not necessarily warm for winter. The cold air goes right through the fabric. I will plan to wear them and will style strategically because I like the pattern but I got what I paid for so I am not complaining. The mirror pic is horrible and gross with finger smudges but I just wanted to show how I styled it."
2.0,They look so much cozier online -- they have no padding or support inside...feels like you are walking on the hard ground.  I guess I am used to Dearfoam or the slippers that have some padding inside for the bottoms of your feet. :(
2.0,Only givi.g it a 2 star because I like the design.  This runs wayyyyyyyyy hig. Will not buy again
2.0,"Material is very thin, low quality.  Returned it."
2.0,"Soft scarf.  Drapes nicely until you put items in hidden pocket.  Then it sags miserably.  Okay is only tucking couple of dollars in it, but add credit cards and it does not hold shape."
2.0,I would not order these again. Very cheaply made.
2.0,"Chose smallest size, still too big. Need to distinguish between men and women sizes."
2.0,had to return due to them not fitting my size. everyone is different so they might fit others better than how they fit me. loved the rhinestones and the slip in feature that these shoes offered.
2.0,"These lenses have a strange, wavy distortion to them right in the sightline. Not sure if this is how they are made or a defect."
2.0,The quality is very cheap.  It's way too stretchy.  Doesn't actually provide much belting because it will always stretch more.
2.0,"The pink is a neon pink and I was not expecting that, at all, based on the color swatch. It's soft and comfortable and fits fine, but the material is VERY thin and seethrough.  I wouldn't purchase again just based on how thin the fabric is."
2.0,"The colors in this dress were so nice but as much as I love pockets, the pockets in this dress did not lay well. It made my hips looks lumpy. Wanted to love it but I sent it back."
2.0,I’m disappointed. This was a Christmas gift for a grown woman. It’s really small compared to the model picture. More like a teen or child size. Probably will return.
2.0,they are not round as advertised.  the odd shape makes them not so pretty.
2.0,It was a lot lighter in color than I was expecting.  Also smaller than I expected.
2.0,"I don't understand how I can purchase two products from this company with the exact same size and one is too large and the other is WAY  too small? I typically wear a large. I purchased an extra large and this suit doesn't cover my girls and is too short in length. I am 5'4&#34; 165 lbs. 36-38D. In the white monokini, the girls fit perfectly but will have to sew under the cups to &#34;lift&#34; the suit as it is too loose in length. I gave this one two stars because IF you can fit this (XL is better for the smaller chest woman) you will delight in this suit. Both suits were VERY good quality. I am about to order three more monokini suits--LOVE THEM! I won't order anymore of the crochet suits and will figure out how to send this one back."
2.0,I am a small to medium at best and I can barely pull these medium sized bike shorts over my hips.  Someone either really can't read a tape measure or they were sized wrong.  Not sure if I will send them back or what at this point.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:a18367a78a571afebe1cfe092259d5fb]] I received this nose ring but quickly noticed that the picture of product and what I received are much different. The model even is picture and the ring looks smaller and less chunky. The ring I received have extra wiring on it and is very heavy. It is still cute on just wish it looked like the advertised product.
2.0,"These are cut for someone very tall with very thin legs: think Twiggy. I am 5'3&#34; tall and the shark bit pants leg hems are all bunched up. The leg part is so tight that they feel like leggings and are a chore to done and take off. If you are a tall very slender person, they may flatter you."
2.0,"I am 5'11&#34;.  I went with the XL one.  The length was as expected, coming just to my knees.  But tie comes up above my stomach.  It's very irritating.  I don't have broad shoulders or anything that would shift it.  It's just really high, so when I do tie it, it's uncomfortable.  I plan on looking for a new one.  The fabric is nice and soft after I washed it, but I am still not happy with it."
2.0,Cheaply made and came from China. Size was way to big and did not like the Material the shorts are made out of it’s different from the shirt
2.0,Chain VERY thin and weak.
2.0,"The crotch area was bunchy and too much fabric, didn't fit me well"
2.0,These are so huge they will not stay on! Dissapointed.
2.0,When finally arrived my order the first item was this necklace and many bids are falling apart from the rest maybe the company have to use a better glue.
2.0,"They are cute and thick, but it took almost 2 weeks to come & they are very big for wise. I will NOT order again."
2.0,"I like that this is a choker. I loved it and wore it everyday. However, I hadn't had it that long when it tarnished very badly and the coating was peeling off. I had to throw it away, it was green and looked horrible. It would be perfect if it didn't tarnish so easily."
2.0,Not what I had in mind would like real leather and for it to be smaller and thinner I like the design
2.0,I bought these vampire teeth for my daughters bday party. The teeth were very small they are really for like toddlers or for small mouths. We we're suppose to play bobbing for apples with them but they wouldn't stay in place while in their mouth. I end up just using them as party favors.
2.0,"Cute and squishy, but my tiny mother couldn't get her foot in them, the part across the instep was just too small for her to get her foot all the way in. Unfortunately, can't return them, and doubt a larger size would help if the instep part is that narrow. She wear a size 6 but this is way too small"
2.0,very flimsy and not sturdy at all! I would not buy again!
2.0,TOOOOOOOO SMALL! Returned it
2.0,I’m 5’3” 150 lb I wear an 8. medium short was too big. These are very thin. Returning.
2.0,"Cute, but *very* small. Too small for my teenage sister."
2.0,This looked nothing close to the photo. I bought this for my wife as we like to go to Ren Fairs and festivals. This think looked like a costume you would purchase at Walmart for Halloween. The material was very thin it didn't fit correctly and the ties came off the first time she tried it on. Complete waste of money.
2.0,I have a very large chest. For this reason I usually wear an xl. I bought a xxl. It barely squeezed over my chest and it flattened everything. It has no give at all. I reordered an xxxxl. Will see how that fits.<br />Update: the xxxxl fits great. It is a little loose in the stomach but I don't mind that. Not too big as I would expect with that size
2.0,"Pictures shows fluffy and good quality items, in reality:<br />Halo didn’t have enough fluff<br />Wings was looking good from one side only, the reverse side was not as nice. The holding loos for arms was super night and hurting my shoulders (and I’m 120 lbs adult)<br /><br />Had to return it"
2.0,"If the earings were connected to the stud not the clasp I'd have an overwhelming positive review because these earings are very cute, but the clasps are connected to the heavier weight of the feather drop and just keep falling off... which means I  couldn't change the back for them..."
2.0,"Cute pattern but very uncomfortable fit; blouse is extremely short but not curved as shown: square cut. Sadly, by the time the shoulders were adjusted/tied to fit my bust the overall length of the shirt had changed. Material has basic, stiff polyester/cotton blend feel, no stretch apart from the cinched back and it will shrink in the wash. I recommend hand wash in extremely cold water and hanging dry while paying close attention to inevitable wrinkles. It’s just not for me; perhaps best for younger women? I probably wouldn’t recommend this based on the amount of details that need to be taken into consideration when picking a size and the disappointing overall quality."
2.0,"This dress was quite cute, however the fabric is extremely thin and see-through.  I tried it with a full slip underneath, but I still felt much to exposed to wear it out of the house. I ended up returning it."
2.0,Hard to breath sometime
2.0,Too small nothing like expected
2.0,La visibilidad es baja
2.0,"They look nice and they are warm. I expected the hill to be a little higher. I will need an insole and thick socks for them to fit better. However, quality is great and I really like the fabric.<br /><br />Wore them only 2 times, they ripped off at the back, I supposed the stitches were to loose. Really disappointed because they looked great."
2.0,fits small and not very comfortable compared to other brands....spend a few more bucks on the other brands
2.0,"I wish I could have liked this dress but the stitching of the flowers was off. Also the large does not fit me. To help others I will share that I normally wear a 12/14. I’m a 12/14 in jeans at Old Navy and wear size L dresses there so I figured i’d go with a L but even then I might go with an XXL because it seems to run small.<br />So about the quality... the yarn is all over the place and one little tug could remove a flower, maybe just that dress? Not sure but I was surprised that someone would think that this dress passed the line to sell. This dress was supposed to be for an event this weekend. I’m bummed about it because I read the reviews on it. Oh well."
2.0,Way too long and loose
2.0,Runs very small and get broken..
2.0,"I ordered a large. The bottom was too small and the top was too big. Manufacturing defect maybe but the top and bottom definitely didnt go together. Very cheapo product , stiff fabric and poor quality"
2.0,I got the 4 seasons pack and they are tiny!  No way these can fit an adult. I had to give them to my 10 year old neighbor. And they are 100% cotton so there is very little stretch to them. Lots of conflicting information about these socks.
2.0,Much smaller than advertised. Should be for a child or any smaller-than-average wrist.
2.0,This was my second pair.  There is something wrong as the progressive lens is different than the first pair.  Very difficult to use.  Practically useless.
2.0,Fit horribly and didnt look very good regardless
2.0,These were not the type of clasp That was described. These are a slot clasp. We wanted the click ring clasp. Other than that they are very nice earrings. They do not have a “round latch back “ As stated in the description.
2.0,2 straps broke on the first day she wore them.
2.0,Sent back.  Inaccurate description
2.0,Mint green and black tops differ. Green dress nice but top is too tight for my job.
2.0,Two of the finger holes are separating at the seam after only a few weeks of average use.  Oh well.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Cheap shoe, I would not recommend!"
2.0,"I'm a bit disappointed. I went to Bitbelts website to figure out what would fit my Samsung Gear Fit and they said the Bitbelt Jr. Unfortunately, when they arrived it didn't fit. I can barely slide it onto the one half but there's no way I can fit the other end into this. The one side of the watch warps this like crazy. I think perhaps, the regular Bitbelt would have fit? I was only going off the recommendation of their website.<br /><br />I think they should put sizes on their website to help with any confusion. That way you can measure your band and you'll be sure of the fit each time.<br /><br />This would have worked well. I haven't had any issues with my Gear Fit, luckily, but I was trying to prevent it from becoming lose or losing it in the future. I suppose I'll just try to be more careful with it.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />Okay, so I spoke with Bitbelt customer service and they told me that the Bitbelt Jr does fit snugly. I thought there was no possible way for it to fit so I tried it again. With a lot of pulling and tugging I was able to get it over both straps. So I tried putting it on my wrist and I'm struggling to get it on one handed. I don't want anything to be this difficult. Customer Service was very nice."
2.0,"Very comfortable, the fit is fine and the pattern is nice. But the color is an extremely odd shade of cow manure green. It will be going back and I will order a different color."
2.0,Quality was weak. Only one side the pattern. Would not buy again.
2.0,There was only one in the package that resembled the picture all the rest were small.
2.0,Necklace began falling apart after 1 week of wear.
2.0,Their sizing chart was way wrong!  I ordered the size they indicated I should wear and it lacked at least 8&#34; of meeting in the middle!!!
2.0,Bought this bag for a friend. Was absolutely beautiful in the beginning. After only 4 months of use the color has faded and is almost cracked looking. It was a gift and she loved the bag...I'm so embarrassed that the gift I gave her looks so horrible. Would never recommend.
2.0,"I give up. I bought in M... too tight.  I bought in L... too loose! According to size chart M should have fit. I am 5’8” 141 lbs  35.5-27-36.5. The fabric feels like a light thin cotton linen.  Comfy for summer. Taupe color isn’t very pretty to me. Pretty drab washed out looking. But, if fit, would have kept.  I also purchased in white. Must return both. Again Disappointed in sizing. Just not for me I guess. 1st pic is size L, 2nd is size M"
2.0,Very cute but yhe spring clip to close the earring broke after two uses.
2.0,This product was returned. It was REALLY small. My toddler can wear this backpack.
2.0,"Size ran small, but the fabric felt great. Will be returning for a larger size."
2.0,"Incredibly small. Order two (2) sizes larger than you. For example, if you normally wear medium, order X-large. These are Asian sizes and Large was far too small for me."
2.0,the fabric is not as good as expected. it looks like a nightgown
2.0,"Upon wearing for the first time, my wife noticed that one pant leg was longer than the other.  I think we got shipped “seconds from the Washington State vendor.  Their price was also $10 more than Costco’s price for Nautical pj’s.  NEVER AGAIN!  Buyer beware!"
2.0,"Hard to expect great quality when buying a very inexpensive dress, but the seams were showing and there were a lot of loose threads so I returned this dress."
2.0,This product looks EXACTLY  as the photo BUT it is extremely too small. I could barely fit my legs threw the bottoms I ordered a large and I wear a 8 in bottoms. The top merely covered my nipples 😒
2.0,"Well made, and the leather is a nice touch, but unfortunately the frame is too narrow if you have a medium to wide face. I am returning only for that reason."
2.0,It was much smaller than the photos made it look.
2.0,"I really love the look of this mask, but there are some major use ability flaws.  First it smells extremely heavily of paint fumes.  It's very chemical smelling and I took it off after a couple minutes due to this.  Mines airing out in the garage with the hopes our mascot can use it next week.  Secondly there is no visibility. You cannot see a thing. There are very small slits in the nose and mouth but they are so small that it's not feasible to use.  I hate leaving a low review because the mask looks amazing, but if it's impossible to wear then that defeats the purpose.  I'm not sure what I can do as far as creating eye holes but if the chemical smell doesn't diminish it won't be use able anyway."
2.0,Damaged on the same day of use
2.0,"I love all my cheap amazon clothes from china typically but this one isn't great.  It is made out of swimsuit material so it is shiny which is odd.  The seams look cheap, and just overall it looks really cheap.  On the sleeves I think they literally just added a few extra inches of the stripe pattern so they are super long.  Also the top color isn't really mustard, it is more yellow.  I wanted to like it but it isn't for me."
2.0,"Once got the laces pulled thru, I couldn’t adjust. The one that goes thru hole to hold tongue up snapped on the end then when trying to get it back out of the lace hole, the other end snapped. Now I’m down one out of the set but I’m not gonna return the entire set bc I don’t want to try pulling all the rest out bc I’m afraid of them breaking so I’ll be missing the middle one on left shoe and just order the original type I got instead of these. For some reason I thought the bead connected in center to snap together, I was wrong :("
2.0,The material was very thin and see through. It did fit but you defiantly would have to wear a slip or something under it. I am not a fan of the material to me it seems to be more itchy than anything. Disappointed in the product over all.
2.0,"Within one hour of putting a pair of these on, one stone fell out of each earring. I was not rough with them, I just wore them outside. One pair is now unusable. I would imagine that the ones without stones will hold up well. Not a good value."
2.0,scratchy polyester.<br />why do boy shorts seem backward?<br />they're longer in the front than the back.<br />I have others that are fine.<br />giving the entire package away.
2.0,"I bought the baseball shirt because i thought the words were funny, it came as expected by the back is so wide!! The way it sits on my shoulders is very comfortable, but I also have wide shoulders"
2.0,Well it's most certainly cute but the quality is not to great ... mine looks torn at the skull and it also seems to be so thinly placed on the bodysuit that it doesn't look completely white for what it's worth I expect better quality
2.0,"This collar is beautiful. It looks just like the picture, and there's nothing out of place.<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />Except for the fact that it's not made for bigger people (people who weigh more). As in, people who has more fat around the neck will most likely sadly not be able to wear this. Including me. I weigh around 250-260 pounds. My boyfriend ordered this for me, and I was completely disappointed and felt insecure just because this collar wasn't made for people like me. He assured me that it's fine, and that it's not the only collar on Amazon, but that still made me feel bad. Thanks GIANCOMICS...<br /><br />If you're a bigger person please consider getting another collar. Or at least check out the inches on this collar in the description and see if you can find any other collar that has more inches on it, so it can hopefully be a garunteed fit. I feel like this collar was made for fit teens. I may be a teen, but I'm not exactly fit.<br /><br />I hope this helps you all, good luck!"
2.0,Cute but way to big for a child's head.
2.0,Product was a lot larger than expected.
2.0,it kept falling off and eventually i lost it after only having it for 2W :/<br />it was cute though while i had it.<br />what a waste of money
2.0,I was excited to get this sweater but it was made poorly and the fabric was not the best. It did not fit like the photo at all and the shoulder straps sat in a bunch. Not a good look for sure!
2.0,"Size is way too small, not standard US size, more like Chinese size.  Ordered a medium, but it's more like a small or XS in US.  The material is good and is well made.  So gave it 2 stars"
2.0,These are super cute sandasl and very comfortable.  I wore them to work and in a few hours the strap came loose. The elastic band holding the strap came unstiched. 😔
2.0,"I mistakenly bought without reading the reviews, the adhesive sticker is way smaller than the mainstream breast petals sold elsewhere. The soft center of the sticker (where you would place over nipple) is 1 3/8&#34;.and the overall petal width is 2 5/8&#34; wide. It does not fit over nipple properly, and im honestly scared to try them on based from reviews i read about it ripping skin off."
2.0,My granddaughter loved the necklace but it broke just after a few weeks
2.0,"This suit was much much smaller than any other 4x suit I have ever purchased. The picture of the suit looks like there would be texture, but it's just a print of sequins. There is no sparkle like I was expecting."
2.0,"Super comfortable. Fits me well and it’s very flattering. I would give it more stars, but I did one wash according to the instructions on the tag. The pocket came unstitched. I wore it for about an hour before the wash, and now have to sew it and hope it doesn’t fall apart when I wear it to an event.<br /><br />*12 hour update* I spent all night, last night, patching up the seams that have come undone on this onesie. The zipper was coming off, the shoulder separated from the sleeve, and now I’ve checked the other pocket to find a hole. If I could get another one from somewhere else before my event, I totally would. This is ridiculous."
2.0,My 8 year old loves the moving ears! But I bought this hat for the lights and sadly our hat does not light up.
2.0,"Just ok. Shirt overall is inexpensive polyester, and does have much of a feminine shape (boxy).  My main observation and complaint about these &#34;golf style&#34; or &#34;polo shirts&#34; for women, is that they are short waisted.  The fabric doesn't fall much farther than the hips.  At 5'7&#34;, I prefer a shirt that is 2-3&#34; longer."
2.0,It fit around me very snug which I would have forgave in a sports bra but the way it sat on me my boobs sort of squished out of the sides and just looked horrible. I made a cute item look sooooo bad. :c
2.0,It is rather tight on me which I know is suppose to be the point but I can't breath in it. Also the material rolled up my thighs which irritated me all day long. I wouldn't purchase this item again.
2.0,Runs huge and was late arriving almost missed her bday the reason I got it
2.0,"Those gloves are lovely but they are completely falling out of the sizing chart as they are running really small. I ordered size L, I have 7.5 inches hand circumference but in person those gloves were not even medium size, they were rather small, I couldn't even stick my hand in it. I should have read more careful that there is no free returns you have to pay return shipping. Really, Mr/Mrs Seller of wrong sizes, you should provide true information before charging for return shipping! I'm a very loyal Amazon customer but you're annoying and disappointing vendor."
2.0,felt it ran a little small
2.0,I wasn’t super impressed by this. I felt that it was very thin and a lot brighter than what I thought I was going to get. I ordered the pink one and it came as a bright neon pink. I have had luck from the company before and ordered for an upcoming beach vacation. It would have been alright most likely for a one time use but I just felt like I could do so much better. It is big so feel free to size down.
2.0,Beautiful dress and definitely makes you feel powerful BUT dress did come broken on the straps. Feels like great material. Not sheer at all. 5’7 220lbs ordered a size XL.
2.0,Glasses see too small. Almost kid size.
2.0,Very Small. the length includes the adjustable chain which it does not tell you in the description.
2.0,"Backpack worked good for a few months, after that, one by one, each zipper started breaking. Now every zipper is broken and won’t close at all. Poor quality"
2.0,The material not the greatest. Super heavy. It doesn’t look like the picture.
2.0,"Nice cap, but it came crushed in an envelope."
2.0,"Although I ordered a size up it still fits like a small/medium. If you're buying, go 2 sizes up. Also the material feels like a weird fabric-y plastic. Doesn't seem like it'd be comfortable to wear in the first place."
2.0,"Cute when the sleeves stay up, but they don't and are quite flimsy to stay up around the shoulders. Had to Return after trying on."
2.0,Poor quality. Huge holes in pockets where they were not properly sewn
2.0,"I just used it for the first time, and while my TSA lock is still locked, the strap is missing. No note in the bag or anything to indicate a search was attempted - the strap is just gone."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this bathing suit cover up, but I feel like it's length gives it a bit of a grandma vibe. It looks better over a black swimsuit, but even then, the tassels reach all the way to my knees... I prefer swimsuit coverups that to hit at the mid thigh."
2.0,"The hoodie is not cotton at all. It’s mostly rayon or polyester, like tablecloth or Halloween costume material.  Am disappointed because my son wanted it so bad for his birthday. I give it 2 stars because the design is the same as picture, but the material is not worth the price."
2.0,"This was a great mask and my son said it was comfortable to wear, but only the red lit up. The blue would not work but every once in a while would turn on. Seemed like a loose wire, bit of course it was sold out and needed it for Halloween."
2.0,"necklace came apart as soon as it came out of the bag, I ordered more then one an they were all the same , fell apart to easy."
2.0,Well made but runs small
2.0,These fit very tight and snug and are difficult to remove.<br /><br />I usually wear x-large latex/nitrile glove.<br /><br />These are definitely suitable for washing dishes and other household chores. They can protect from heat of the hot water.
2.0,"Comfortable band, the loop hole I use is pilling after not much use and I had to reuse the pins to secure the strap to the watch from the watch. The pins they sent were too small. I did not reach out to the company to see if they would send me the right size. My quests is they would send them, just didn’t want to put in the effort. Good price for the band. Happy overall. Would probably buy again."
2.0,IT look ridiculous on my significant other I couldn't help but laugh.
2.0,Luckily I used this for 1 night but this is NOT an adult costume the skirt barley stayed on I had to use a safety pin to keep it up and the hand cuffs kept falling off because they were way too wide
2.0,Too thin and very small in shoulders but  if every where else
2.0,"These socks might work if a person has very skinny ankles. The ankle part is extremely small and tight, there is no way I can wear these. I even put them over my wrist, which is 6 3/4 inches, and it was still tight!<br />I have been looking for someone to give these to but no one I know has child-size ankles with adult size feet.<br />The material and construction otherwise is fine, but for whatever reason the ankle part is way too tight so I don't know who these could fit.<br />Also they are men's socks which you would think would have bigger ankle part than women's socks."
2.0,Poor quality.  They are small and for young child.  They look weird on adults.
2.0,"HARD to get the adjustment buckle through belt loops. HARD to adjust tension while wearing. And the belt gathers up your pants in back making uncomfortable bunches, while pulling the belt loops out of shape in front. If you think obviously I have it adjusted too tight, any looser and it does not hold the pants up, it's too loose. So... doesn't do on me, what it does on the models. Goodwill they go."
2.0,Wear it as lounge wear
2.0,Too short and tight in arm openings
2.0,"This shirt is cute and is made of a nice, thinner material. I hate thick t-shirts, I don’t know how people don’t sweat to death in them. The problem is that this came with a hole in it and since I have to wear it the day after tomorrow, I can’t send it back. I sewed up the hole but it was not on a seam so it doesn’t look the greatest."
2.0,had to return because it was too small
2.0,Cute but super skinny for my 7 year old.
2.0,You need to have a perfect body to feel comfortable in this dress. Fabric super thin can see all imperfections or shape wear underneath.
2.0,"Came sized much smaller than expected. Dress is a very lightweight material. The next size up was sold out so I gave the dress to my friend, as I can get no use out of it."
2.0,"Does not appear as pictured. The shorts look super soft and comfortable, but the material was coarse and super cheap. I would not reccomend for $22.00 dollars each.  Not a good value for your money."
2.0,"I was really excited to finally find underwear for an adult woman with a 22” waist, kids undies are not high rise enough and offer no bum coverage like adult underwear (briefs) do, however these are bigger than indicated in the size chart, not for a 22” waist unless you like underwear loose, especially in the bum, which I’m not sure why anyone would, as loose underwear bunches.<br />I like the fabric, they would certainly be no-show, so I’m going to cut the seams and take them in about an inch on each side to fit me.<br />I refuse to wear a thong or skimpy panties as they are not only uncomfortable but obscene, and ride up in places that are not good for hygiene, but sadly those are usually only what’s available for super skinny adult women…like manufacturers think we all must want to have pornographic undergarments because we are thin… nope!<br />I’m just really annoyed I cannot find the size I need, except in children’s sizes that are too low rise, too small a gusset for a panty liner or pad, and too skimpy on the bum cheek coverage. Ugh. Sorry for the rant. These are not true to their measurement if your looking for undies that fit and are properly snug."
2.0,Out of all the shirts I have received from this company this is the worst it's thin material the cut where it ties  is so high that it shows the bra
2.0,The principal idea is nice but in reality it sucks. Arrived broken and disfigured. Doesn't move nicely and the edges are sharp
2.0,Nice style but the material was cheap.<br />I returned
2.0,"The straps fit the watch; however, the width of the leather strap itself was too skinny for the heavy face of the 5S.  It looks comically disproportional.  Disappointed."
2.0,Ordered L cuz  I'm a small and still was pretty snug. Was ripped in the inside as well.
2.0,I wanted to use this for international travel to organize all my cables and cords but the weight of the grid organizer added to much to my carry on so I didn't use it.
2.0,I'm using these in AK. I expected a lot more out of these since they are Bone Collector Brand.  I usually like their products but this one seriously falls short. The conductive material DOES NOT allow for precise control on a touch screen seeing as I cannot even type the code to unlock my phone. In less that a month of being in my pocket and only being used on outings it's already acquired a hole in the bottom of the right thumb. I'll be using these as a liner glove.<br /><br />Pros : reasonably warm<br /><br />Cons : conductive touch for smartphones is useless
2.0,The top of the sweater was extremely large along with a very long arms. The bottom of the sweater was tight. I returned it.
2.0,"Well, this strap look nice and etc, but that's what I got trying to use their own tool to adjust it, 'cause my hands are small. The second way of adjusting didn't work too cause the lock is different than at the scheme. Now I believe I need to take it to some clock repair to help me with that."
2.0,"I got these glasses because my eye doctor suggested blue light blockers for computer use.  They arrived on time, fit well, were clear, and magnification was good.  However, when I tested them with an online blue light blocking test....I saw no appreciable difference in the test pattern colors.  This would defeat my purpose for this purchase."
2.0,"The picture shows two necklaces instead of what is was sent. Paid cheap, got cheap."
2.0,Had holes in them after a couple months and make feet very sweaty.
2.0,And kinda awkward. The sides don't stay up and I don't know any one with a large enough head to wear it. Definitely not for kids.
2.0,"Peesy cheap pare of ear rings and necklace. I'm pretty dos pointed even for the price. You can see glue marks, it looks like it's something you would but for play time. Pretty sad.  I would not buy them unless you want a cheap piece of jewelry."
2.0,Blurry lens
2.0,Super cute head band!
2.0,A little disappointed.  The colors are not as pretty as they where on the picture.
2.0,"Poorly constructed, it came apart."
2.0,"I usually wear a medium but bought a large so it would be a lil loose, it was too big. I’m 5’3 157 pounds"
2.0,Not for toddlers more for babies.
2.0,Although it was a great design and size I couldn't get past the odor and had to send it back. I thought about washing it but it being black and canvas I didn't want to chance it.
2.0,its a lot shorter in reality than it looks in the picture.
2.0,I am 5'5&#34; and 110lbs. I have a hard time getting it over my shoulders. Its very tight except the arms are a bit loose. The legs are long. Idk what person this was made for... A woman with long long legs and a very short torso. Its also very thin and easy to tear. Ok for one time use but not extend use. Disappointed.
2.0,its as thin as a shirt
2.0,"These are very flimsy. They are soft,but so thin you feel the nonslp nubs on the soles of your feet and can only wear them for a couple of minutes before it bothers you. Would not recommend for ambulatory people. Convalescing or bed ridden people they would work perfectly for."
2.0,"Just received it today and am bummed that I have to return it. I’m usually a size Small top, but ordered the XL after reading some of the reviews. It fit well, but it’s too short. Was hoping to wear it with a high waisted skirt, but you can still see two inches of skin on my back and the skirt rested right above my belly button. Other than smelling funny, the quality was good for the price and the shipping was super quick. I also like the fact that they have several options to return it if it doesn’t work out for you."
2.0,definitely not the product in the pictures. its the same concept but not as well made or with the same gemstones.
2.0,"The picture makes this look like it is two or more inches wide when worn.  It is very thin, only about an inch.  The charms are small.  When worn everything overlaps. This is best suited for someone with a large wrist so that the bracelet fits tight enough that you can spread it out to look more like the picture and it will stay in place. This would fit my upper arm or as an anklet.  The tightest setting is 7&#34; and it expands to 9&#34; so I don't recommend this for small frames.  Nice idea but only works with a tight fit, perhaps for someone with an 8&#34; wrist size."
2.0,I am so disappointed by the color!  I thought it would be a lucious evergreen color perfect for the northwest and instead it is almost anheather gray.  This will likely go back.
2.0,Didn’t fit right.  It was too small which made the slit really high.
2.0,too tight and too thin
2.0,Should've been cheaper. It looks great. Not sure about warmth yet. Prob. Should've go thermo one.
2.0,"They claim these also fit adults, but don’t tell you they mean “adults with children-size heads”. May be great for kids, though."
2.0,"I bought these for my dad and he only wore them around the house in the evening.  Very light wear. After 6 months they were completely falling apart and he is ready to toss them out.  I was trying to contact the seller directly but there isn't a way to do that.  Unfortunately it led me to leaving a poor review.  Though I understand these are inexpensive slippers, they should last more than 6 months and I'm disappointed in their quality."
2.0,it was easier to keep the item and donate it than to go through all the hassle of a return.
2.0,too small and got holes within 3 times of washing them. will not purchase again.
2.0,"Tight fitting shirt, looks more loose and flowy in the ad photo. If you have any type of shape to your body it may fit more like an undershirt. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
2.0,I liked design but they have a very flimsy clasp that I can see breaking easily. And the suede bands are very thin & look a bit cheap. The price should have topped me off. I returned for credit.
2.0,"I ordered this because it got such great reviews and I am on the constant search for the perfect hybrid workout/casual skorts. Well, this one did not fit the bill for me. This is due almost entirely on the fact that there is NO compression or shape support whatsoever. I suppose if you have a great figure and don't ask much from your clothing in the way of shaping, this might be great. I found this to be almost too big, SUPER stretchy and super clingy at the same time. Even with the lack of compression and snugness in the shorts, the skirt manages to cling to me rear in a very unflattering way, especially given that the shorts are so loose, revealing ever dimple and lump. And since it is touted as &#34;swimwear&#34; I was totally shocked by the seemingly soft and flimsy fabric. I would NEVER wear this in the water as they would droop and hang down so badly. This are going back to the seller."
2.0,"The fabric is thin and the pink color more washed out than the product pics show. I ordered a medium, and am 5'8"", 140, 36D, size 6 jean. It layers great under the flannel shirt I bought it for, but otherwise more like a pajama top; you wouldn't wear it on its own. Plastic buttons, too. :/"
2.0,Will not keep your feet dry
2.0,"The band size was correct, but the cup size was way too small"
2.0,"This bracelet is cute but is not very sturdy, the first one I wore broke within one hour period. The charm is fine but the actual bracelet is not."
2.0,The clasp is junk. The watch would fall right of my wrist.
2.0,I received and it was broken. I was very disappointed.
2.0,"The fabric is stretchy and light, but the size is WAY off.  I ordered this in 4X, and it would only have fit my 9-year-old niece.  Not plus-size at all."
2.0,Too boxy. Does nothing for the shape
2.0,I followed the instructions to the letter and it was two sizes to small.<br /><br />It would cost most in gas to send it back (Drive the the UPS Store) than to just throw it in the trash....so I did!
2.0,"Dress appears beautiful.  However, while I like the lace bodice, the skirt was rough and felt like canvas.  I have had lots of luck with dresses purchased online but this one was was a “dud.”"
2.0,$10 for a designer ‘leather’ cap was a tip that false material description was to be expected. I checked the cap labels and reread the description by Bebe and read the reviews. Cap described as pebble leather. Naw!  Also a seam in the back was not sewn in. Very disappointed but OK item for a rainy day or a a sweaty workout in the garden!
2.0,"Was not the first picture, which other people had mentioned in their review. However, I got what I paid for."
2.0,Shirt is really cute. Had a lot of trouble getting it to stay on my shoulders and not keep falling off.
2.0,It is much shorter than the pictures. It hits right below my sports bra.
2.0,i have to admit when i first took this out of the bag i really didn't like it. But once I tried it on i thought it looked a lot better i'm glad i given it a chance.  I gave it 4 stars because when was not constructed ir sewn very well  but all n all cute<br /><br />Update: the frist time I work them they ripped a hole open in the crotch
2.0,Good product but one came ript (right hand) everything else is perfect.
2.0,"Not too impressed with this. It fit a little smaller than expected. It was super sticky and stayed in place at first, but as time wore on it falls off, starts to move, and loses its stickiness. I would NOT buy this brand. Try a different brand. Ends up being uncomfortable and sticking out at edges. This is not my first &quot;sticky bra&quot; so I know how to use/apply them."
2.0,They are okay.  They seem very cheap. I'm sure they will break after using them a couple times.
2.0,Small and plastic feel
2.0,"Runs small, need to order up... hopefully I can return for a larger size"
2.0,Easy to put on but straps are a little flimsy
2.0,Was not actual size.
2.0,"These broke after just a few wears. I didn’t wear them that much so by the time they broke, 5-10 times of use, the meddle clamps fell apart."
2.0,"The product came with a bird missing! Only a yellow lonely bird inside :(<br />This was supposed to be a present for my bf's bday, but even if I order it again it might not get here on time! Disappointed with BDS."
2.0,Such a disappointment....size is not accurate
2.0,Increasingly small I wear an 8. I ordered 9 my toes Hans over the top. I would order 3 sizes up. This would be fine for an older child. I would be getting an 11 next time even for a size 8 (USA) foot. Also the rubber strap is really harsh it caused a blister on the outside of my ankle. That may be due to the size problem. M. Illinois.
2.0,"I would have kept this skirt, but it is VERY see-through. Other than that, I absolutely loved it."
2.0,It's very thin and not the bright white I was expecting.  The sleeves are much shorter than they look in the picture also.
2.0,Really cute... my boobs don’t fit though. Returned.
2.0,Very cheaply made. All 4 broke after wearing only a vouple times
2.0,Poor fit for athletic build.  Waistline is made way to wide and looks like a dress
2.0,"Poor quality, took to long to get delivered. Not a true legging that you can work out in... Fit akward, and are that comfortable, but they do have a pretty design on them"
2.0,"I was very excited to receive this dress. Well, it arrived today and it looks nothing like the picture except for the sleeves. I normally wear a large and still will have&#34;wiggle&#34; room. This dress fits more like a small instead of a large, the material is very thin.Wish it was like the description. It did ship fast."
2.0,Didn't find them to be comfortable
2.0,These rings were a little bit better in size I ordered three sets of rings together there were two that came that were extremely small. And these were slightly bigger I could fit maybe three of them halfway on my fingers but they really need to start making these rings and several different sizes to fit several different finger types! Service different customers not just little teeny tiny hands.
2.0,"Was really excited to buy these after viewing hope scopes youtube review on these , but unfortunately was greatly disappointed. Upon trying them on the fit was perfect, then the following day i found myself every 5 seconds pulling them up as they kept falling off all the way down to my thighs. Really wish they would be tighter in the waist area!"
2.0,"The dress arrived FOUR MONTHS after I ordered it (3 months after its original delivery date). It did not fit because of how long it took to get here. The lace is not fully attached, it is only sewn on by a couple random spots meaning that any 6 month old baby is going to grab the lace and put it in her mouth. The edging of the lace is not hemmed so when it goes in baby's mouth she will end up swallowing threads.<br />Also, I ordered the purple and the lace looks violet in the picture but is actually grey.<br />(To the credit of the company, they did give me a refund when I requested it, so I would not completely refuse business with them in the future)"
2.0,fits small in shoulders<br />way to long
2.0,"Wish I had spent more time in these before washing, I'd have returned them otherwise.  Waist size runs at least 1"" too big, the pant length is WAY too long for supposed regular cut, and the crotch is unnaturally long.  On a positive note, their general quality seems above average."
2.0,These are soft as described but the stitching is sloppy. There are long black threads loose on every seam. I’m afraid it will be only last a few washings.
2.0,"I initially loved the product, I liked that the band is comfortable. The plastic that attaches to the watch itself broke after very light use."
2.0,So I got this on sale for $14 but I only wore it a couple times and the inner material is coming apart and fraying and the clasp fell off. I’m sad because it was cute.
2.0,very tight small fitting runs tiny
2.0,Not as shown in specification.
2.0,"Cute but I can tell the zipper will break really soon. So cheap, in a bad way! No room for a wallet photo and it comes w an additional c card wallet that doesn't really fit inside the pocket. The zipper keeps catching on it. Sad bc it's cute. I'm tso turning it."
2.0,The bag is cute but it hardly lasted at all… ripped in less than 2 months ish..
2.0,"These leggings are flimsy, thin and not suitable for outdoor wear."
2.0,This necklace only looks good with no sleeve shorts. Everything else seems overwhelming.
2.0,Should have listened to the reviews. Way way too thin. Not much point to these if my 3 yr olds undies can show through before they even get wet....
2.0,"Larger than expected, and the color is much more neon pink than in the picture"
2.0,This did not fit as expected for the size I bought it for
2.0,"The liner is a very cheap, poly style. Assuming this was put in because of the complaints about it being itchy. The liner is not fully sewn in, it just just attached at the shoulders and armpits, so it rides up. The fabric on the outside is not very soft - so I am disappointed. I read the reviews and should have listened, but figured I would take a chance.  Save your money and spend an extra $20 on a quality piece!"
2.0,these were too big for my arm
2.0,"Thin base, uncomfortable, I will have to buy an added sole support this came hard as a rock! Sheepskin bade is thin and ineffective."
2.0,"Runs a bit small, and the fabric is TOO clingy"
2.0,"Nothing at all like the picture! Material was very cheap, shiny and had a slimy feel. It also had a few small pulls. I sized up so the size was fine. The style was different too, mostly because the material was so thin that it basically had no shape.  I feel like I received something different also.  I read the reviews and they were pretty good except for the most recent. At least the return process was easy."
2.0,Not great for fitted clothing
2.0,Pretty dress but way too small.
2.0,Not real leather. Doesn't even smell like leather and if you look at the holes for the clasp you can see the foam material they used to bind the whole strap together.
2.0,The bra portion is see through and it arrived broken in half. From what I could tell it would have broken easily regardless
2.0,It looks good but it is had to put on and take it off. My son complained everything we tried to put it on and take it off
2.0,"These earrings were very tiny! They're cute, but they were way too expensive for the size, and it's not even sterling silver!"
2.0,"Nice fabric and feel, but the red is more pink than red in color. Also the length is too short- more like a boys size than men's."
2.0,"The shoes are simply gorgeous, but they run small, The fit across the front is for women with slim feet, not high instep."
2.0,"It was so cute in the picture.  I put it on and the neckline is much higher than shown and the one side goes up a good 1/4"" above the other side.  If I wore 5"" heels it would still be 4"" too long - I am 5""5'.  I wouldn't recommend unless someone that does wonders with the sewing machine wanted to get it cheap and remake.  Disappointed!"
2.0,Love the inside comfort band. Like the size as it gives good sun protection. Unfortunately straw is cracking after 1 wear and missed return date.
2.0,Delivered as expected. Color as expected. The built in pads would only work on breasts that were not natural. The bra created a unaboob. Did not work for me. Good quality material but did not provide support.
2.0,"Slippers have been returned for refund, but no evidence of that happening yet..  Reference number is D9HIIz f1RRMA.  Pleasew help.<br />Daniel R Weber"
2.0,This is not cute. Looks super cheap. I just threw it away.
2.0,These bracelets arrived in a Tiffany blue box. (Not a butterfly gift box as mentioned)<br />Each bracelet was individually wrapped - which isn’t the easiest to remove.<br />The box also included a cleaning cloth.<br />The men’s bracelet makes a lot of noise when shaken on the wrist.<br />The metal doesn’t show finger prints which is nice.<br />The material (stainless steel is what it says in the description) is very cheap looking.<br />The gold color on the men’s especially looks very fake.<br />Both bracelets are plenty big.<br />The women’s bracelet could be worn and look not super cheap but the men’s is pretty bad.
2.0,This was a Christmas gift. My daughter pulled too hard on the straps and they have broken. Very disappointed because she only wore it once.
2.0,Way small. I wear 10.5 shoes. I had to return 2 times and finally settled on size 13. Still feels small
2.0,Had to return<br />Way to big<br />Size 1
2.0,"Overall this dress is pretty cute but the buttons are so far apart from each other, specially the ones on the breast area, that I’ll have to put a pin between them. The material is a little see through. I’m 5’0, 130 lbs, 34b and the small was the perfect size."
2.0,I was disappointed due to receiving the wrong color - I received BLUE instead of navy - but since the style was nice I wore it anyway.
2.0,"It was not the wide headband I was expecting that Nike normally has. Also was expecting an adult sized headband, but it unfortunately is youth. Had I known it'd be a skinny youth headband I would not have paid as much."
2.0,Leaked out side within a couple hours
2.0,Didn’t do anything for night driving.
2.0,"Liked the look, just not the fit"
2.0,"These are really cute! I gave them a low rating because they are not as shown. Out of 30pc, 14 red, no turquoise, no black and white. Won’t order from this seller again."
2.0,Looks and feels super cheap
2.0,"I expected this item to have higher compression and be made of thicker, sturdier material.<br />The band that holds it on your upper arm has more compression than the actual sleeve leaving a ring around your arm and the rest is like glorified pantyhose. I got a run in one arm within 3 hours!<br />Not impressed"
2.0,all plastic
2.0,"The waist band has no support and its a bit see through, I can't wear it for leg day so I use it for upper body day. The scrunch is awkward and it slips down from the waistband."
2.0,"This bracelet comes as two. Also the charms are not very secure, I've had the bracelet for a few weeks and half of the charms are gone."
2.0,"In less than 2 weeks of use, the material is flaking off. It's unfortunate, as the design of the bag's compartments and strap and really great. It's larger and holds a lot more stuff than one would expect. I like the interior design as it makes it easy to keep my sunglasses and keys handy."
2.0,The XL didn’t fit my daughter who is 5’4” and 137lbs. It was tight
2.0,"This shirt is made from a nice stretchy material that I like and it is well made. It is, however, cut quite a bit on the short or tight side compared to others of the same size (I wear a medium in shirts and in this shirt I would need a large). My biggest complaint is the cut of the arms or where the arms are attached to the body of the shirt. Even if I’d ordered the next size up, I could not wear this cut because of the placement of the sleeves. It would be passable in the next size up as long as I did not need to raise my arms. With my arms raised, I have too much material on the top of my shoulders and not enough material in my arm pits."
2.0,Doesn't really hold especially well. Constantly needs adjustment.
2.0,"While it's a really cute dress and I love the style of it, the arm holes are way too big and show a lot of my bra. I had to return it. There was just no way to wear this without flashing a ton of bra through the arm holes."
2.0,The dress was completely see through. I wore a beige bra and you could see right through.
2.0,"I wear this around almost daily and it worked beautifully the first 2 weeks, but now it’s not holding a charge! I thought it was my cord, but no! I used 3 different cords and they all were fine. It’s just my beanie randomly stopped charging! How irritating!"
2.0,I returned it...looked so cheap and the material was rough.
2.0,"The first time I used this bag, the shoulder strap ripped right off.<br />The bag also smells very bad of petroleum<br />Very disappointed"
2.0,Hat was too large. There is no way to adjust size.
2.0,"It is not obvious that there is metal on the band in the pictures and I did not see anything written in the description about metal being on the band, especially because where it is located it is in constant contact with the skin when wearing with your watch. I believed the low price it was all silicone, but alas there is metal that holds the band ends together and it is not covered by silicone on the inside.<br /><br />Unfortunately I am allergic to nickel and of course at this low price point it is made with cheap metal (including nickel) as I woke up the next day with a rash exactly where the metal touched my skin overnight. I’m usually careful to order something that specifies nickel free, but again I did not see any obvious signs pointing to metal being used.<br /><br />Which is a bummer because otherwise it’s a great swap when I want to change band colors from my original. FWIT the original Apple band that came with the watch has metal in the same spot however they did not use nickel because I have worn that band for over two years with no reaction.<br /><br />So if you aren’t allergic to nickel/react to cheap metals - go for it! The color was perfect and it was plenty comfortable, with the exception of my rash that has now appeared from the metal."
2.0,"Arrived perfectly and seemed to hold up, but the clip broke after 2 weeks."
2.0,I don't know why I bought this one. Seriously! shop at Ross's instead!
2.0,Very cute in person.Downside is it moves around to much won't stay in place while on phone.
2.0,Dislike this dress
2.0,I really like it but the bracelet is very hard to put on.
2.0,Uncomfortable and ill fitting.
2.0,"Usually I wear a 2x, ordered a 3x that was still waaaay too tight"
2.0,"I really liked the look of this band on my watch, it added a nicely professional look, and I even got the band adjusted for a nice fit with the provided tool (not easy, but it worked).  However, as seen by several others per the reviews, the connectors directly interfacing with the watch itself came loose very frequently causing the watch to fall off so I didn't feel like I could wear the watch when working on anything that required significant movement.  Unfortunately, just when I thought I had that issue figured out by tightening the screws, one of the provided pins that connects the band to the watch connector broke.  Only lasted a week...had to go back to the default watch band.  Hoping to find a compatible heavier-duty pin or get a replacement."
2.0,The piece looks nice but no matter what I try it won't stay on my ear. It just keeps falling off.<br /><br />very disapointed
2.0,"no stability at all, just rolls everywhere"
2.0,"It works, but the quality isnt realy that great. it breaks easly."
2.0,The product looks nice. However it smells really bad so I’m not thinking it’s real surgical steel
2.0,Not worth the $6.99. They are super cheap and are not reusable.
2.0,Just did not seem like a good quality shirt for 50$ sent it back.
2.0,"I wear compression socks every day, for long shifts on hard floors that involve constant movement and little sitting.  I love the design on these but they are my least favorite pair of socks for actual function.  They are very thin and seem to have less actual support than any other pair of compression socks I have used.  The foot part is big... I wear a shoe size 8.5, but the heel in the sock tends to go somewhere near my Achilles’ tendon and lower calf, unless I leave extra material under my foot.  There is no reinforcement at the heel or toe, and I’m not sure how long they will last.  Finally, they don’t breathe well... I have noted my feet get a bad odor wearing these that they do not get with other socks.  For looks these are great, but for function they let me down."
2.0,Honestly it’s a good bag seems well made but mine didn’t come with the American flag patch! Let down
2.0,"For years, I’ve been looking for a nice, basic ribbed racer-back tank, as I used to purchase the “Perfect“ tank at [corporate store name] (which I loved) — until they cheapened their inventory, and started using thinner material, crappier stitching, and cut corners. This is very similar to [store's name] low-quality tank. It does the job, but it’s cheap clothing from China. I wouldn’t buy it again.<br /><br />Size medium for 110 pounds fit fine."
2.0,Returning it! Too narrow and tight. Not comfortable around ankle.
2.0,Those doesn’t look the same I seen online
2.0,Looks a little to cheap. Ended up not using it
2.0,Not the quality I expected from Ray Ban
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4f0d8de209f0c0afc447664b9235124f]] The item does not fit well at all. The lace is way too big and does not even sit on the garment well. This is going back.
2.0,"Took the advise and ordered a larger size, glad I did but DOES NOT fit as pictured. I am an XL and even went larger to a 3X, if i wanted this to wear as pictured i would need to order a 5X. Also, be aware that this does not feel like a t-shirt, it is thicker (warmer) than what i would wear in 100 degree temperatures. Other than those issues, the shirt is fine."
2.0,The fabric was rough and that in its self was disappointing. The design was beautiful. The fit was great (S) but the elastic bands that went around the breast to the waist then arms was very rough.
2.0,"The material, fit, and quality are all nice however after one trip to the beach I can’t get the small black spots out as one reviewer had mentioned."
2.0,"The bag is super cute and it goes with a lot of outfits!! I liked this bag a lot, but it was not very sturdy."
2.0,"bought these for my wife, when she tried them on, she didn't like how they fit on her"
2.0,Waayyyy small. Barely covers my 4 yr old's bottom. Not very good quality either.
2.0,"This dress would be perfect except for the yellow material right at the muffin top on the hips.  Darker colors at the mid section, please PattyBoutik."
2.0,"I tried on when I received it and it fit so I put in the washer on cold water and hung out to dry. When I went to wear it, it shrank. I can wear it but it now fits smaller than I like. I want to return it and get a bigger size but not sure I can because it has been washed."
2.0,"This is NOT Burgundy, I got a RED blazer it was not want I wanted, since I ordered a Burgundy blazer, but the shade of red is somewhat dark so whatever, I'll keep it; is for work so that's okay. The reality is that is not really flattering, not wrinkle-free, doesn't stretch really, cheap material, very thin, no lining so it doesn't hold. I'm gonna take it to a seamstress I guess so next time I'll just go to Kohls."
2.0,I like this hat style. This particular one did not fit as expected.
2.0,"I loved the look of this when we opened it, but after my daughter has worn it for a little over a week, it is tarnishing very badly and the chain which in the description was supposed to be sterling silver says 18K gold plate on the tag.  I'm debating what to do, because my daughter loves it but I'm concerned about what maybe in the jewlery aka lead."
2.0,"Not sure what else I can say here.  It arrived promptly, it fits, and I like the looks of it.  Stood up well to three or four washes, but of course that's not much of a challenge.<br /><br />*After less than a year you can see David's teeth and that's about it.  Pretty horrible quality really.  Lowering rating."
2.0,The bottoms hardly covered anything back there and the white part is very see-through. The material didn't seem thick enough. Not real impressed.
2.0,Broke. Right away
2.0,"Odd material, unfinished hem, weird pleats. Would not recommend."
2.0,I found the product of medium quality
2.0,So I ordered the black and white in two different sizes (medium &large).<br />I've attached a picture of the large next to my victorias secret sweats that are a size medium so you can see the size difference in the waist.<br />The fabric also varies with size. The size medium was more of a soft stretchy to the touch and the large was stiff.<br />Im 5'6 134lbs and the large was even tight around my waist.
2.0,"While stylish and very attractive, they remind me of the ""Opti-Grab"" in the movie ""The Jerk!"" There are too many distractions when wearing them. the outer rim and nose bridge wire are highly visable when wearing and a very dangerous distraction while driving. If I'm not behind the wheel I'll enjoy wearing them as they look great, but not while driving. School Bus Driver"
2.0,"I bought these because I liked the way they looked. In hindsight, while they look fine, the quality leaves a lot to be desired. The elastic around the legs is very low quality and doesn't hold well. The stitching is also prone to tearing. I would not buy these again. I will spend a little more money to get a better product."
2.0,"I wanted so much for this bathing suit to work. I'm 5'8, 36c, and wear a size 8/10 usually. Generally i would get a large, but I opted for an extra large for this product. The material is good, and no issues at all with the bathing suit being to tight causing the &#34;sausage effect&#34;. The reason I give it two stars however, is the fact that it is extremely short for someone that is my height. I'm not conservative when it comes to my backside showing, which it does in this. My issue is that in order for my top to reach the bra inside the suit, I have to hike it up so high which causes one of the worst cases of camel toe. Also the straps aren't the most comfortable when I'm trying to balance out what exactly is showing. This suit will definitely work for someone who is shorter and smaller chested."
2.0,Sleeves were too small and I don’t have very big arms
2.0,Does not fit like expected. Shows the dress hits at the knees when in fact it is a full length dress.... Wasted my money
2.0,I don’t notice any difference in these socks. And definitely not any warmer.
2.0,Papery material. Weird fit... looks messy
2.0,I bought these for myself in a XL and they were so small. They were able to fit my 13 year old daughter perfectly and she wears a kids 12. She loves them. They are soft and durable.
2.0,Way too big for bracelet
2.0,I like the clarity of the lens. I got a 2.5. The nose clip is very tight and uncomfortable to me. Also the lens are very close together. I have had other nose clip lenses and was much happier with the comfort and the size.
2.0,They were adorable... 2 hours ago. Now it’s falling apart after the first use.
2.0,First of all the colors in the photos do not match the actual shorts. I bought the Blue shorts solely based on the fact they showed to have a black under tight while most other colors had white. They arrived with white under tights and the color blue is not as dark as it appears to be in the pictures. The fit is also kind of weird the tights aren't exactly tight and they will slide down a bit while trying to do a squat. Overall not very happy with the purchase and may return.
2.0,The comfort did not last to much
2.0,Does not have the look or feel that I was expecting. If it wasn't so close to my departure date I would return it. Disappointed.
2.0,"Too small, too see through"
2.0,"The jacket is very snug but fits as expected based in other reviews. The hardware used to tighten the hood and the waist snapped instantly on first use. While it looks and feels good, it is poorly put together. I would pass on this unless you're not planning on being to active while wearing it."
2.0,Not true to size vary small. They do have great color and feel soft
2.0,Fell apart after two months
2.0,Very thin material.  Kind of see through.  Needs to be ironed all the time.
2.0,It's itchy not soft material. Also it's short. Not a maxi dress...  definitely not worth the money though
2.0,"The pants are so soft! They fit like leggings, very tight and kinda pull on the crotch, across making it a tad un-flattering. If you are above 5’8 they will also be shorter."
2.0,"This dress fits well and as expected, however the embroidery is on a piece of tulle which is then sewn onto the dress.  On the dress I ordered, the tulle was not sewn flat on the dress and it bunched up in the stomach area.  This did not look flattering at all.  I did notice also that the padding for the bra on the dress is barely sewn in.  I returned the dress as I am not a seamstress to fix this."
2.0,"They are not very comfortable, too stiff. Not as cozy as I thought they would be."
2.0,"I don’t like this dress, don’t have shape and is super long.The dress makes me feel like I’m in a PJ. Maybe good for a person that’s like dresses like that."
2.0,I thought the picture showed that the glasses have bluish tinge..but what arrived is brown
2.0,"Not a fan of these for adults. I have a normal sized head, but these were very tight and gave me a headache. They also don’t protect eyes very well against the sun. I really wanted to wear them for a retro party, but they were just too painful to wear."
2.0,These looked just like the pics but whatever they use to add the tint makes them hard to see out of. Needless to say I don't wear them.
2.0,How hard is it to size arm guards?  These are so skinny that they are painful to put on.  I have wet them and shoved a fruit jar inside them and I'm hoping this will stretch them out.  I do believe they will protect my forearms.
2.0,It’s cute but so think you can see right through it.
2.0,Works for about 2 hours then nothing. Feels like sitting on a layer of wood.
2.0,"Way too large, and quite short. Other reviews noted a boyfriend blazer, the one I received definitely is not. Fabric and quality seem nice. I was just looking for something a little longer than waist length. Notice they do not show it on a model. Check for review pics before ordering. Return shipping is on you."
2.0,look very cheap
2.0,Picture is deceiving.  Very small and cannot be used on the shoulder. Overpriced.
2.0,It didn't look good on me! It made me look like a peasant!!
2.0,"For the price, not the quality I expected!"
2.0,Nice size and feel.  Zipper broke within the first month of use.
2.0,I wanted this capfor a raccoon costume but it looked nothing like the picture. It had none of the rings on the tail and just looked like a piece of brown mink/fur.
2.0,The shirt is very thin and cheaply made. The color Blue doesn't match the blue on the shoes. Prolly wouldn't buy again.
2.0,One stretched out quickly and started falling apart.
2.0,"Can’t get the chemical smell out of this. I read review on other listing that it smells really bad and it doesn’t come out. But I didn’t believe it. Guess what its true. I washed it twice, then soaked it in dish soap, in essential oils and nothing helps . Don’t want my baby smelling these chemicals so can’t wear it at all."
2.0,"It’s cute and what I wanted, it’s just not the prints I wanted. So you can click on what you want but you might only get two out of the four correct"
2.0,"I love a blazer year round, but this one is not for me. It's made out of polyester and not the good kind. The fabric is itchy and has a weird swishing noise when you touch it. The fit is pretty unflattering if you have broad shoulders and a narrow waist - very boxy. I can't see myself ever wearing this"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f99ee768d2f47004c67f9862ea842b9f]] The material is super thin and way smaller than I thought it will be. I got a medium and it’s not what I thought it would be. The color is lavender.
2.0,Was not size 2T..way too small!
2.0,"Not too happy with this item.  I presented this to my husband as a wedding anniversary gift.  I ordered a size larger and my husband can just close it, unable to tie it to stay. I need to exchange it for a larger one, or request a refund."
2.0,"I was so sad that this didnt work out. The dress was just what I was looking for, but my boobs were to big and the dress was even just a little to small even for an extra large around the waist"
2.0,Nice earrings at a good price. But they hurt my ears.  I'm returning them.
2.0,"I bought this for a body painting photoshoot. Im glad I brought backup because they didn't lay smooth. After following the instructions, I put it on. The front bunched up like a wavy line. We tried to make it lay properly but it wouldn't. The adhesive sticks well and if it wold have laid flat, it would have been great. But there was a definite panti line."
2.0,It's just doesn't look that good when u get ur hands on it. It looks kinda cheap 😢😢
2.0,Top fits ok but bottom is tooo small and I ordered a size up.
2.0,El tamaño demasiado pequeños
2.0,"I typically wear a large, but ordered xl bc it was fitted.  It was so small, I couldn't even try it on.  Also, be clear that only the sleeves are a satin like material, not the whole blouse.  Very see through, even for a white top."
2.0,Color didn't match description
2.0,I’m disappointed in the quality of the dress and the made in China stickers on the bags.  Giving as a Christmas gift to my twin grand-babies.  Too late to return.
2.0,"I was not happy with this set.  It looks cheap, it came in a plain white box (not the nice velvet box that Camrose and Kross usually provides).  And there was no certificate saying that it is a Jackie Kennedy piece.  I would not order from this company again."
2.0,I loved the straps but couldn’t find a matching screen 😩.
2.0,"The fabric is more suitable for a raincoat than a dress. The style is nice, but bexause of the fabric texture, I did not rate it higher than 2. It's ok for the price I guess."
2.0,"I'm only 6' and yes I have a big head. The ""one size fits all"" does not completely cover my ears and it feels like my head is in a vice"
2.0,"The fabric is horrible, my legs were itching while I was wearing it, the waist is too high while the legs are too long. The leg part doesn’t surprise me, because I am 5ft but I had to fold it over about 3 times on the bottom. The fabric isn’t very breathable and definitely not like true leggings fabric at all. I would never buy these again."
2.0,Starter falling apart after the first time wearing it. Looked great at first.
2.0,Pretty and made decently well but giving 2 stars because it is too long for a nose ring. Half of the bar hangs out of my nose.
2.0,"The fit was good, but the lens are not good quality.  Not even close to manufacturer quality.  I do not abuse my sunglasses.  I have had these, obviously for many, many years.  I like the fit of these, unfortunately, Arnette does not make them anymore.  Thought I would try replacement lens.  After a couple of months, they stared discoloring, losing the dark tint.  Almost as if they are peeling.  The discoloration is getting worse.  Purchased in July 18.  Started seeing problems within 3 months and now I don't use the glasses anymore.  Too bad.  I had high hopes.  Maybe it was bad QC, I don't know, but I would not waste the $30 again."
2.0,"I'm not a small girl -- 5'10&#34;, 150lb, 36C.  These are just too big.  They're a little loose around, and a lot too long in the straps.  And they provide absolutely no support at all.  I wouldn't even run for a taxi wearing one of these, let alone do any real exercise.  Very disappointed.  They're really only good to sleep in."
2.0,"Very nice looking glasses, and worked well but polarization wore off with repeated cleaning."
2.0,Too small. Weird fit
2.0,"I liked the idea of money clip built in, except it needs a stronger clip so you won't lose money."
2.0,"These rings were cute when I first got them but I wear them every day and the coating is wearing off very easily.  I am a nurse and I wash my hands/use sanitizer a lot, so that may be part of the factor, but I was very disappointed nonetheless."
2.0,Writing in a foreign language and the size was way too big….can’t use them for now..maybe in a year or two
2.0,"The watch on its own is nice but made with average materials. It keeps good time, but it is bulky and uncomfortable but I was willing to except it anyway. The clasp on the rubber bracelet broke just after the 30 day return policy expired. I will replace it."
2.0,Wasn't made good. The sequence falls off alot
2.0,Not very happy. Rather small.
2.0,"The color was beautiful and the material was soft, but construction and fit weren't great. The &#34;lace&#34; at the bottom is so stiff that it stands out like a hoop skirt rather than draping naturally (NOT flattering at all). And the front is pretty short...be careful that your pants don't ride too low unless you want to show your midriff."
2.0,Fits okay but very disappointed in the color.  Actually a very very pale blue. not vibrant as shown
2.0,You would expect a size 48 to have cups larger than what looks like &#34;B&#34; cups. Fit everywhere but the bust....way too small there.
2.0,The color was right but the style and fit was not as shown in the picture. Was a lot more loose fitting than depicted disappointing.
2.0,"I ordered the sunglasses for my daughter and we only received a case. The case seems nice, but she needs protection from the sun. Please help!"
2.0,"For one of the earrings, the stud was unattached to the double circle. Otherwise the earring is absolutely beautiful and delicate. I will need to superglue the earring back."
2.0,"The blouse does not look like the one I saw , the piece added to the bottom is about half the length I saw and I wear large but it was way too small for me."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this top but the fit was very awkward. The seam on the front that should be like an empire top runs straight across the chest, which gives the impression that you’re trying to hide a pregnancy."
2.0,Size run small got it as a gift for my son and dissatisfied with the product representation just regift I guess🤔🙄
2.0,I just installed these and the lense color is great but the lenses are half the thickness of the originals and they rattle in the frames. Will not buy again.
2.0,SO disappointed.......too too little.....too fine.
2.0,Thought it would be smaller
2.0,I liked it and wore it about 10 times before the Pom at the top started to rip away from the hat. Not happy at all. It is warm. The cc leather logo made a brown stain on the inside white fleece.
2.0,"The Blazer looks nothing like the featured picture they advertised. The girth of the jacket is too wide and the length is shorter than what is shown on the model. I'm 5'3"" and 150 lbs and I bought a Medium. It made me look very ""pungy and boxy"" because the jacket has no shape or length like shown in the picture. I get I'm not the same size as the model, but see for yourself in the pictures I've included...looks nothing like the photo other than the color."
2.0,They for oddly the top was tight but the bottom was loose. And there were tear lines along the mesh part. I will not be wearing them.
2.0,Cheap; the dress made very poor;  And on all sides the belt badly made the seam all turned
2.0,I love the top but there is a tear in the side seam. I would return it but it’s too much trouble. Very disappointing!
2.0,"I bought this and honestly forgot about it until today. otherwise I’d return it.<br />It looks cute but when I tried it on It’s cheaply made, The stripe is sewn crooked and goes up over the chest on one side. It’s junk and I wish I would have sent it back."
2.0,Product started out great but I have now had it in for 3 weeks and 3 of the 5 “stones have fallen out”
2.0,"Here is what I liked about the Kimono: Color/Pattern, fit and price. Here is what I don't like: after TWO WEARS AT THE BEACH, (TWO!!!!!!) pieces of the fringe just started glided off!!! I hadn't even washed it for it to start falling apart as it did!!!  So needless to say i am very disappointed. I seriously can't even touch the fringes because they just start falling off... its so annoying!!! I do NOT recommend this kimono. Save your money and purchase from other dept./chain stores."
2.0,It’s VERY cute however not sturdy at all<br />The magnetic clasp comes off ALL the time. If you aren’t careful it can un magnetize and slide off your wrist<br />Only recommend to wear during an activity that doesn’t involve too much movement
2.0,"I love the color and construction of this towel wrap. I am 5'3"" and somewhat chunky, so I purchased the XXL size and it fits well.  I am a bit disappointed though for it is not as absorbent as I thought it would be, so it really can't be used like a towel. I plan to return this."
2.0,"Way too small and stitched like tights, not leggings. These are not meant to be worn without a dress."
2.0,the white was extremely see through and the dress was not as flattering as I thought it would be
2.0,"I was careful to always turn the top inside out for washing, but after only a few washes, it had these burrs on it. Fit does not look like the photo. Unfortunately would not recommend this item. Other Youtalia thicker material I've gotten is good so far but not this."
2.0,It turned my finger green.
2.0,"Purchased for teen Halloween costume.  Went with a sweatshirt due to cold Michigan weather, however this shirt is more like a heavyweight T shirt and runs quite small.  My son is 5'6"" 145 lbs and the Adult Med is snug.  Will definitely not wash before use."
2.0,"Just received the anklet.  It fits with no room to spare and I have average size ankles.  I bought it for my granddaughter and her ankles are larger so I'm sure it won't work for her.  Also, the extension doesn't look very strong.  Not as nice as I hoped it would be.  Paula LoFranco"
2.0,They say cotton...but not cotton. Cute. But not cotton.
2.0,"If you are busty forget it! It is also very heavy material.  I have another one I bought at JC Penney's a few years back and it is light weight, larger cup area and comfy. I bought this as a back up.  It arrived right before I left for vacation, so I had no choice but to take it. It did fit ok enough to wear for the pool and lounging, I just could not do a lot of moving around in it, or I would have popped out the front. I only wore it once though because even on the patio in the sun and 89 degree weather it never fully dried. Totally disappointed!"
2.0,They are comfortable but flat already and lifting away from the rubber sole
2.0,"Literally, no one is talking about how see-through these are. I would not trust these in the gym."
2.0,"The dress is absolutely beautiful, though it may be a bit tight around the bust. I couldn't tell though since the zipper tape is damaged and I can't zip it. I tried to repair it to the best of my ability (glue. I tried to glue it. It didn't work). I wore it to a Halloween party holding the back together with safety pins, but I'll need to either send it back or try to fix it. Not sure what I'm going to do for my Halloween costume though since I can't exactly wait 2 months for a replacement."
2.0,Started tarnishing the first time I wore it...bummer because it's really cute otherwise.
2.0,"Meh.  Went with the size chart, not true to size.  Material is super thin.  Im 4 11 short so and the ruffle falls at an awkward length Had my hopes too high.  I will wear as house clothes."
2.0,Dosent stay on the ear
2.0,I purchased these ear muffs for my son to use when we go to see The Monster Trucks this weekend and when I attempted to try them on him one of the muffs broke off! Took me 30 minutes to get it back on! Hopefully it holds up thru the show :(
2.0,"I usually wear a (US) size 10 (sometimes 12) or a medium/large. My measurements are about 38-30-47. I wear a 36c bra... and I have rather wide hips and a booty... so, I was expecting just a little more cheek action than normal but that wasn't the problem at all. These bottoms BARELY covered my front!! My whole 'nani was on display and I got it in an XL, based on the reviews and chart provided! Nope. Returned. However, the top fit absolutely perfect and the bikini itself was fairly well made for the price. So, I just wish the sizing was better proportioned and closer to the sizes described."
2.0,"It was very comfortable at first but after having worn it for maybe an hour at the most it began to dig into my ribs and shoulders, and was extremely painful. Great if you are planning on only wearing for a short amount of time, but not for everyday use."
2.0,These do fit and are super cute but they are hard to get on a 2 year old
2.0,Very cheaply made. Colors faded within a week
2.0,Tried them on and they are cute but immediately noticed they are thin<br />Almost like thick stocking without much rayon as you would expect in yoga pants. I ordered larger as I’ve learned through years of amazon purchases. In “Pink VS” yoga pants I wear a medium. I’m 5’8 and 150#s average build. In these I ordered a Lg/XL and I’m glad I did! If I were very curvy or had more weight to stretch these I’m afraid you would see right through this material. Not returning yet jury is still up on this purchase. I’ve purchased several colors that are not in yet so I have time to make a final decision.
2.0,Good fit but would have been perfect if there are extra rubber retainers included. My toddler removed it and couldn’t find it anymore so one useless mask for her
2.0,The outfit was really cute but the size I bought which is the regular size I always buy for my daughter was way to small.
2.0,"The angle these are bent at is not correct, and they're too long. I had to bend them myself with pliers and then use a wire cutter to cut off the extra length. And then the end was super sharp. I have these lying around somewhere to use as a last resort."
2.0,Very difficult to put on the glass frame.
2.0,Dollar Store Quality...Not for a Serious Jeep Person.
2.0,It slides down when you sit. The material is good and soft.
2.0,Was not shaped and could not shape it as photo- am not using it. Did arrive on time and the company was efficient- just did not like the product.
2.0,"These tees are way too thin, even for summer. Not satisfied with this purchase at all."
2.0,"These run short,  I am not tall, 5'2"" and these did not come up to my knees.  Makes them useless for me."
2.0,"These earrings were cute, but very, very tiny.  Did not like them!"
2.0,"ITEM WAS VERY ROUGH,HAVE ORDERED THE SAME BRAND AND VERY SOFT.THIS VERY ROUGH NOT AS OTHER."
2.0,It's okay it's definitely cheap quality but you get what you pay for
2.0,Fell apart after my daughter wore it.
2.0,"The bottom part is way different than what it's shown in the pictures, it's a small thin thong and I'm not comfortable with it. However, the baby doll part fits good and I'm very pleased with how I look with it. I'll keep it but forces me to search for a bottom part that combines. Disappointed."
2.0,"I was so looking forward to getting these. Then blah. Wha-wha. They have no give. Think, wearing clogs to the ⛱️  beach, walking in the DRY sand. Sent back the next day."
2.0,Really nice and fits good except for the arm holes and sleeves.  For an extra large and usually i wear a 12-14 they are way to small.  It stretches a little but still very uncomfortable.  Except for this major issue I would give it 5 stars.
2.0,"Although this dress fit, unfortunately it is not as pretty as it is advertised. It looks cheap."
2.0,"The turtle is cute but, the card did not come with it.  :("
2.0,"No la recomiendo mala calidad  a los 5 días pelada,"
2.0,Cheap lace material that has white color ends of elastic showing like white lint. Poor quality sewing. Good point is that the dress Fits well. Bargain price.
2.0,"It is not totally wrinkle free like my other wrinkle free shirt. For it to look crisp, you'll need to iron it. It is hard to button due to the button openings are very tight."
2.0,Unreturned the product due to do not match descriptions. It’s small compared to the size in the website. Not nice!
2.0,"I was disappointed with the color.  It's very bland looking and not rich looking like the photo.  In the picture the hat looks like it would cover my ears which is why I got it but it doesn't cover my ears.  The brim is nice and big, how I wanted it, but it came w/a bent crease down the middle which I can't make go away.  The top of the hat that can be removed was wrinkly and not smooth and doesn't look good.  Overall for the money I spent for the visor I am not satisfied.  Returning items and paying for the shipping is a hassle so I am keeping it."
2.0,Wanted a bag could secure with the straps. Straps have snaps that come undone to easily either allowing theft of least stuff falling out.  Side pockets are not big enough to hold a water bottle so for me a waste of weight. Rest of bag looks ok at a quick glance. Will gift it to a daughter though.
2.0,"Dress was to the floor in length, the slit in the dress was perfectly placed, but I must have needed a smaller size as I could not adjust the straps any tighter and there was a seam that went to the nipple area of each breast that could have been better placed.<br />I’ll still wear it again."
2.0,Stem on hooks to small fall out
2.0,Smaller than expected-no elastic waist or drawstring so you have to be exact size to keep it on. Returned.
2.0,The only problem is that the plastic used had a terrible chemical odor.  I've left them outside for 2 days but they still smell.  Any ideas?  I really like them !!!
2.0,Set in wrinkles and shiny (not in a good way) fabric.
2.0,I gifted it right away to someone much smaller than myself. Great price but not sized well at all.
2.0,"I can't use the tunnels because they are so thin, and that was what I was most excited about."
2.0,"Love the boots, the fit, and color. But the pull on plastic straps we're not made well. I returned the first pair after 1 day when my toddler was just putting on her boots and the strap broke off at the base. The second pair has lasted us about a month ~10 wears and the strap broke in the same way, at this point I may just cut the straps off, but they do make it easier for toddlers to put on. The overall quality of the boot is great except for the straps, they seem unlikely to crack like many other rainboots for kids."
2.0,I did not lime the way it looked very cheap looking.  All plasticity
2.0,"A couple of the pins that hold the strap on the watch were smaller than others. I had to swap pins from one strap to get it to stay on the watch face. Thankfully I only intend to use one color, otherwise I'd be out of luck. Don't buy this garbage."
2.0,"Just a headband, basically. Maybe my head is weird? I thought it would stay on better."
2.0,Just received the jacket and the stitching  is poorly done.  It’s on the collar so it’s very noticeable.  I will be returning it for a full refund.
2.0,"The first wristband I purchased was soft to wear,and look pretty in my apple watch.  This was my 2nd purchased, the texture was harder and looked very cheap. Maybe done by another manufacturer."
2.0,"This was purchased as a gift for someone.  Unfortunately, the receiver did not like it, and I am returning it.  Features that are good include compact size, RFID feature most useful in today's world.  Features that were not popular with receiver: money clip and stiff construction."
2.0,The suit was nice but I will be sending it back of a larger size.  We requested a medium but received a small. My grand child like it but was disappointed because of its size.
2.0,"The picture is incredibly faded and mine fits as if it were just a normal hoodie. It doesn't look very high fashion as I was hoping, it kinda just looks like a normal hoodie that I probably shouldn't have paid 49 bucks for."
2.0,"The package label listed six pairs of the black socks. In the package was four pair of printed socks.  I kept them, but come on-look at the package when you fill the order."
2.0,"Clasp broke the second time I wore it.  I returned for a refund.  If not for that, it was actually cute."
2.0,I used these to be a troll and attached them to a wig so not sure how they would stay on your ear with out adhesive. Looked awesome.
2.0,It was okay when I received it it was already starting to rust. I was very disappointed.
2.0,it's tight near the sides of my toes.  I kept them because it was less trouble to go through the ordeal of returning them.  I use them as a last resort.
2.0,"This was my 3rd time to order this. Based on the sizing information, I ordered 2 pants at size16 and they were too huge. Returned them and ordered 12, again returned for same reason. Size 12 still won’t fit. Now, I ordered a 10 because I really like it for its softness and warmth. I’m traveling soon to Central Europe and I need warm winter clothes."
2.0,Rather cheaply made suit. The bodice was ok but the skirt part seemed thin and had no sewn hem. I'm 5'5&#34; 135 lbs. It fit just wasn't thrilled with it.
2.0,Very long and runs large.
2.0,Leg too tight... foot too long.
2.0,It looked different then the picture also seems very cheap like something I could get from the dollar tree.
2.0,Size was spot on but the quality is very poor.  Stretched it pulling it over my head and the seams burst all across the front at the color change.  Guess I should have expected based on the price.
2.0,"Not as shown. Only little ""tit"" bumps<br />Kinda cute. Fits adult heads"
2.0,It’s just two sided fleece not Sherpa cotton so it’s warm but not as warm as if it had the lining
2.0,"This t-shirt runs small - I'm 5' 6"" and 125, and can often wear an extra small t-shirt. But I ordered a ladies small and it is so tight that it seems like it's a youth size. I think I'd need a large! It is also pretty scratchy - I prefer softer materials. I need one for an upcoming Duran Duran concert but I'm going to return this and order a different shirt entirely even though I like the design better then others I've seen."
2.0,"Way too small. I ordered an extra large and couldn’t get it up past my knees. Good material, but sizing is awful!"
2.0,"Wore it 2 days and the metal tip of the buckle popped off. It's not a huge deal but still, it's brand new ya know? Honestly better going to H&M for 6 bucks and getting one there."
2.0,"The shirt seems fine, the pants are pretty huge but I'm not too concerned about that.  There was no headband at all so I'm pretty disappointed. So it seems for now I've just bought my daughter a shirt..."
2.0,Looks like the photo but the material is extremely cheap. The material is comparable to nylon/plastic table covers. So weird. Will be returning. Otherwise the fit is okay.
2.0,"I love the look, feel and comfort of these pants but they are piling after a few wears."
2.0,These took a long time to arrive. They are very small and poorly crafted. Although they are cute but not made for several uses.
2.0,"I bought it and did not even go running with the band, and in just a couple of days, the band where it connects to the watch just tore, making the watch unwearable."
2.0,"Timely shipping. All of the glasses arrived in the case and each pair was in a plastic bag inside the case. EACH LENS ON ALL THREE GOGGLES WAS SCRATCHED!! I was amazed, they all had tiny fingerprints and large scratches that couldn't be be wiped off. I would like to send them all back but too much trouble.<br />They are also fairly small and there is NO way that prescription glassed could be worn underneath. Overall way disappointed."
2.0,"Not a true size , so it comes aleast two sizes smaller"
2.0,"I wanted to love it but it’s not as shown, does not fall off shoulder.  I sized up to get that effect and it’s just too much material.  It’ll sit in my closet 🤷🏻‍♀️."
2.0,"I loved the fit and everything about this dress, until the strap broke my first time wearing. Quality is lacking."
2.0,hideous color and style
2.0,"Smaller/thinner than expected. Build quality is poor, black paint uneven, markings very light/faded. I would have spent maybe 3-4 dollars on this. I don't recommend it."
2.0,"Sadly one stone fell off during the return period so the earrings were returned.  This happened with both stones from the &#34;Interstellar&#34; earrings that I purchased about the same time.  I have other earrings from Nickel Free that there has never been a problem.  The stones are beautiful and the earrings are excellent for sensitive skin/ears.  If you do purchase, watch the return period of time in case the stones fall off!"
2.0,Can not use it.  Had to give it to my son.
2.0,"Beautiful and I loved the weight of it, unfortunately it fell apart the second day I wore it."
2.0,Just got it today very disappointed I'm a 20-22 and this fits like a 14-16 gave it to my daughter fits perfectly fine on her..
2.0,"Not great for running, inner shorts kept riding up"
2.0,was not happy did not fit
2.0,"They look great, but the flat plastic around the eye flattens out too much when tightened making my eyelashes touch the front.  I think because of the size that they don't fit narrow heads.  I was also looking for goggles that don't leave ring marks around my eyes.  I tried these out yesterday lap swimming and the left kept leaking.  :(.  Even when I tightened it to the point of uncomfortable, it leaked on the left eye.  I think it is the shape of my face."
2.0,"These are super cute, but I found them to run small, so sadly they had to go back :("
2.0,Jewels never stay in this is the second pair I've tried. Beautiful otherwise.
2.0,"First of all, I use this to protect myself from getting infected (virus), I wear this in public places. I rieder use this instead of a mask, I don’t have to worry about forgetting it at home or misplacing it, it’s in my neck all the time, it’s so easy to put on and off. I like the idea that the neck is wider at the bottom and protect my neck from the sun, it’s definitely better than other neck gaiters. Also like the colors selection. Now, the negative side of this is that,  it is not cotton, the face is a little narrow or too tight, the fabric is very thin and chip and I don’t believe it has Uv protection as it’s advertising, I don’t know how much sun protection it has. It’s really hard to breathe even though the fabric is thin. I don’t recommend this.  I would buy it again if the owner change the fabric to cotton and improve the quality. Make it with cotton, uv protection, breathable, wider in the face, keep the neck as it is, keep the solid colors and VIOLA! I guarantee you that you will make $$$$$<br />Don’t lie to us (the customers) we know when something is a good quality or cheap!"
2.0,I never wore it because the neck was too tight
2.0,The pants look good.  I ordered them in blue and received purple.
2.0,"****UPDATE****<br />I tried a working fan from my other child’s costume and sadly it still does not inflate all of the way. It’s as if the air does not get flow enough to lift the head up. I spent an hour searching for any holes or busted seems and found nothing. The feet are also completely torn up after one use while my other daughters looks brand new for the second year in a row. Save the headache, spend a little more for a better quality costume. Pictured is me in the costume as it will not blow up and then both costumes side by side when it first arrived.<br /><br />This dinosaur costume, I actually liked better than my previous purchase (the more expensive version). That is until the fan quit working after three uses. It was not batteries as we tried multiple out of the box and it just wouldn’t fill up all the way. I loved the fact we could use a battery pack with the USB but even that would not inflate the continental all of the way. It made for a sad Halloween for my 7 year old as it only somewhat inflated for two hours before it completely stopped working."
2.0,I had to cut off the arm part of the shoulders making it into a tank which now fits a little better. Before I could not even fit my arms into the holes
2.0,"Very unhappy with this product. They are advertised as children’s sizes and they are far from that. They fit my husband! The edges are not even seen, looks as if someone just cut material in a Bunch of pieces and packed them up for shipping. 👎👎👎"
2.0,At first I loved this! Lots of earrings for a great price. But I put one in my Tragus two days ago and then noticed a ball was loose so as I was screwing it back on it broke in half. Annoying cause it broke and I don’t want to lose the earring but it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for<br /><br />Update: changed earrings and this one broke also. The ball literally breaks in half
2.0,These are good looking frames but they are break easily just from normal ware and tare.  This is my 2nd pair within 2 1/2 yrs.  I would have chose another pair of frames but my lens were under warranty.  Also 1 arm is uneven causing the frames to sit lopsided on my face!
2.0,Did not include the pant. The picture is misleading.
2.0,You get what you pay for. This came with no tags; stitching was off/imbalanced.
2.0,Was a tad too small. .Fit more like a shirt.. Would have kept it but it has a hole in it..
2.0,"The product was nice, fabric was nice but not a nice look on a larger person to boxy"
2.0,didnot like
2.0,"I'm giving it 2 stars because it's cute. Unfortunately, mine came with what looked like oil/grease stains. I did wash it to see if it would come out but was unsuccessful. I'll be returning it and possibly buy a new one to see if it comes in better condition. Also, buy smaller than what you normally wear."
2.0,The sweater lights up in 3 places. The light on the left side did not stay on. I wore it to work for our Christmas party. I had to CONTINUOUSLY tap the left side to make it light up. It would light up briefly and the wouldn't do it again unless I tapped it. I am a female & I ordered the 4XL.. It DID NOT fit true to size. I wish I could return it. $50 gone down the drain
2.0,The idea is good so I bouts two. When they arrived I was extremely disappointed  by their quality. The frames are flimsy most likely stay in shape or unbroken.
2.0,Bad quality material. Not what I expected.  The dress fits but it stopped above my ankles and I'm only 5'5
2.0,"Box received damaged/crushed as there was no packing in the box; just the hat wrapped in a plastic bag. The style was cute; however, very heavy for a straw hat. And, the chin strap is not adjustable-just a thin piece of elastic which is quite uncomfortable. (Another review said this elastic snapped upon first putting on.)  I purchased this as a Prime item for no S&H. Now, when I need to return, the hat is ""no longer available"" which means I am responsible for the s&h to return. Very disappointed."
2.0,"The fabric feels strange, cut and fit are odd; would not buy again;"
2.0,"The quality was nice enough, but I was hoping for shorter shorts, and these seemed long."
2.0,way to tiny
2.0,Nice fabric but the torso length is too short. I could barely get it on my shoulders to zip it. I wear size 10 american and I ordered an XL and the torso is too short. Dissapointed. Poorly constructed garment.
2.0,"This boot runs small and I therefore had to return it.  But what disappointed me most was when I attempted to reorder the same boot in a larger size, the price had increased.  I had to order a different boot."
2.0,"The first dress I purchased was size small in Black-Red and it fit perfectly. I get a ton of compliments and LOVE it, so purchased another one in small in floral green. The floral green one is HUGE, rendering it completely unwearable. The tag says small, but it fits like a large. I'm very disappointed."
2.0,Runs small I wish they were longer as well
2.0,To tight need a XL
2.0,"I don't know what the case was with mine but I bought the two pack and only one arrived in the mail. However, the pair that I did receive was extremely comfortable and fit really well; I am 5'7 and weigh 170 for reference."
2.0,"These were quite a bit larger than I thought they would be but that's not really my complaint. my complaint is that these do not hold shape at all. you can't really even wear them because they're so soft. you have to squish the earring together to clasp it closed and it doesn't hold, let alone hold the circular shape. 0/10. would not recommend."
2.0,"This dress looks so much better on my monitor than in person, sadly.  It's very cotton-y, so it doesn't drape well.  The top part looked.....dowdy.  Maybe I'm just not well endowed enough to fill it out - very possible - but it just fell awkwardly and looked frumpy on me.  The bottom part was ok and I *almost* kept the black version, but in the end, I returned both the black and red I'd ordered."
2.0,In this I looked like a big yellow blimp. No thank you!
2.0,"These little pants are cute! But the fabric has zero stretch. They’re cut on the narrow side, so my chunky girl with her big cloth diaper is certainly not fitting into these! If your baby is long and skinny and you use paper diapers, these pants might work. But for us, they are adorable, but they aren’t wearable at all."
2.0,to small no stretch
2.0,Was not what I expected.  the hat is see through. I hope my mom likes it as I got it for her mother's day gift...
2.0,They fit well but are so hot! I felt very overheated after 30 min. in the grocery store.
2.0,"Bracelet broke in half after one wear, disappointed."
2.0,Top not tight fitting. Not a fan
2.0,Didn't like how it felt.  Not enough support and like I'm falling forward..
2.0,I gave this dress two stars the Buttons fell off after the 1st wash...
2.0,"Picture shows no tags in the back. It comes with 2 tags sewn very securely in the back. I would have to pay to ship it back, so I will be donating it to probably GoodWill"
2.0,"They fit just fine. My issue is the odor on them. Smells strongly like fuel and doesn't wash out, I've tried vinegar with essential oil and baking soda with no luck."
2.0,"I enjoyed theese but I got such an unbelievable rash and hives, next time please use better materials it would be worth a price increase"
2.0,Shrinks to a belly shirt after one wash
2.0,Not durable at all. The guy comes untied when you ride and the motorcycle shield has already broken off. Had it for less than a week. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,"Theyre okay i guess. Very bulky to wear though and i gave it two stars cause ? I mean what am i suppose to do with the 2 extra rings that dont fit me. They gave me 7,9&10. I dont wear 7 or 10. So overall i feel like its not worth for the price."
2.0,"Love the coat, it's very warm and fits really well. It's more stylish than I was expecting and I really do love its fit/feel. However, the reason for the low rating is that the hem on the left sleeve started unravelling from the bottom up on the very first day I wore it! Disappointing :("
2.0,"This is not really a plaid -- more of a very small checkered black and white pattern which I liked very much for the style of this dress.  I wear a size 6 and ordered the small.  It fit beautifully in waist and hips and arms, but the bust was too tight.  The fabric of this dress includes a fair amount of Nylon and Spandex which gives the dress an overall stiffer drape.  This is nice for the A-line skirt but also doesn't allow for air flow and natural expansion around areas that are snug.  This fabric would not be very comfortable in a warm, hot, or humid climate, and my preference would be for more cotton in the fabric.  I also did not like the sleeve puffiness at the shoulders.  There is a small amount of padding at the top of the sleeve and a bit too much extra material, accentuating the puffed sleeve much more than you see in the photos.  While I loved the vintage style, the heaviness of the fabric and it's nylon/spandex content was not tolerable.  However, I will definitely keep an eye on Miusol for further creations in their vintage line."
2.0,I personally wouldn't buy these they look like chick pants then dude pants. Returning..
2.0,"This is the perfect pink. It is a nice size for an evening out. Though, it's not leather. The listing is full of it.<br /><br />Secondly, there are hanging strings all over the place. No problem, I can trim those off.<br /><br />Thirdly, there is a stain on the front. It arrived like that. I can't get it off, either. I am trying to decide if I want to keep it or send it back because it is NOT what I expected."
2.0,The material was cheap. It shunk.
2.0,the strap broke after first use
2.0,"It really DOES NOT have a knit cuff.  I should have believed reviews,  but I was hopeful.....<br />Brand is Transforming Technologies.  Their products are fine.  The jacket is ESD & also the right size.  BUT I BOUGHT IT SPECIFUCALLY FOR THE CUFFS,  SO YOU GET 2 STARS. s(・｀ヘ'・;)ゞ  😡😡😡  Remove the knit cuffs descrietion if you dont have them!"
2.0,These are definitely not oversized. I was highly disappointed when I opened my package and saw it was averaged sized. In addition it feel very flimsy as if it’ll break easily. I’ll give them to my 13yr old daughter but it’s def not for me.
2.0,"Too small, I had to give to my 10 years old nephew"
2.0,Huge a as if not attractive at all— returned
2.0,"Over all I like the shirt but it's at least 6+ inches shorter than the pictures. Hits at mid hip, not upper thigh and the cross in the back comes up to the waist of my jeans, so entire rear end is not covered at all. Comfortable but probably not too flattering."
2.0,"The sleeves were too short, I had to return it."
2.0,Cheaply made. They are not one piece they are two and they separate from each other.
2.0,"I got this for my mother and unfortunately this necklace is very heavy and pinches her neck.  She said she would try to wear it over a turtleneck shirt but we live in Florida, so....."
2.0,"I should have listened to the reviews on this product, it really is very cheaply made, very thin almost as if it would be used with dolls. Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,"Loved how it looks, only lasted a month. The strap broke on it. Tried fixing it and it broke again."
2.0,"Too tight, pockets are so shallow that they are totally useless. Cheap feel."
2.0,"i got the red tunic dress. Firstable, it&#34;s not chiffon, it's cheap plastic. it;s tight around the waist and big on a top. not really like the photo. disappointing."
2.0,"I wore these socks in a hiking shoe that I've worn comfortably for a long time and the socks caused a very painful blistering around my toes.  Not sure if it's due to either the construction or stitching.  Wearing any other pair of socks in the same shoe caused no blistering.  Perhaps I received a defective pair, but perhaps not."
2.0,The bottoms are awesome but the top sucks. There is very little support.
2.0,Because the elastic is not as wide as the skirt waist band it makes it look like you have pooch. It is a very strange fit for that reason. The skirt was otherwise nice quality.
2.0,"It looked cobalt blue on the pic, I received dark blue."
2.0,"I really loved the wallet when I first received it! It looked great an really minimized the amount of stuff I carried, but the sliver pull tab fell off in my pocket on the first day of using it. Really wanted to like this item."
2.0,Didn't know it was that tight fitting and see through it. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,"Few have the perspicacity to:<br /><br />1. Know what ""perspicacity"" means, and<br />2. Know how big their head is in terms of wearing glasses.<br /><br />Bottom line: Reading glasses are best bought in person."
2.0,"I did NOT like the way it fit at all, I looked pregnant and I'm not overweight at all. I weigh 125. it was not flattering at all!!"
2.0,Cute but sheer... I ended up returning!
2.0,"Pros:<br /><br />-Price point.<br />-Lining is fuzzy and warm.<br />-Wash and fit are fairly current.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Overall, the tailoring and finish is what you’d expect at this price point. The denim is thin (although that really only matters in long-term durability, the lining is more than enough to keep warm.) But I wouldn’t say the construction is sturdy enough to handle a job site. The stitching and details cut a lot of corners.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />They’re good enough on the most basic level at the price. And realistically, they’re kind of a specialty garment for most people. Something to wear on those few below zero days. If you work outdoors, you probably already know what works for you. That being said, if the factory asked me, I’d say they could wring a lot more value from budget for this garment if they dumped a lot of the “frills”. Look at the history of jeans and model after the simple, early designs. They were simple, but they were engineered for workplace durability above all. Ditch the contrast stitching and funky front pockets for proper French seams throughout and canvas front pockets. Cut all the design from the back pockets and just do sturdy patch pockets. Lose all non-essential embroidery and push that budget towards overall materials quality and simple, but sturdy, construction. Overall, they aren’t terrible for the price, but I’ve seen it done better with far more efficient design decisions at this razor-thin margin.<br /><br />Edit: Zipper disintegrated soon after. Not good."
2.0,They fall apart after a few washes
2.0,"I would never have purchased these, if I realized these men shorts were handwash only. That is crazy for shorts they are going to work out in."
2.0,"The dress was just a tad smaller than i expected. The zipper  is HORRIBLE, every time you try to zip the dress it gets stuck and i feel like I'm going to break it. The material was nice and heavy. Good winter dress."
2.0,It’s very pretty but mine was of lower quality and thinner fabric.  The size runs very small. It is good for only a one time use.
2.0,Not the best compression stockings. Loosens up after a few washes.
2.0,"These are not fleece sweatpants.<br />They are regular leggings material joggers. Very thin, not warm at all."
2.0,"Super cute for price but definitely runs small, my girl is 5.. she is skinny for her age and I bought size 6.. it was tight and long on her."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this watch band…And I did like the style. But the length of the band itself was just goofy.<br /><br />I don’t have small, tiny wrists. If anything, they’re just average. But after tightening the band to a point that was adequate, too much of the band’s “tail” would stick out past the end of the Velcro.<br /><br />And while it wasn’t a massive amount of extra slack, even the 1/2 inch or so that was there just looks goofy…..So as much as I like the style, this one is a no go for me and I cant recommend it unless you have  substantially thick wrists.<br /><br />*******************************<br />I rely heavily on reviews when I make purchases so I put some time into reviewing everything I buy on Amazon for personal or business use so I can help other people considering that item. If you found my review helpful, please consider hitting the ""helpful"" button below when it asks if the review is helpful!"
2.0,Fits well. Ordered black and got a grey hoodie. :(
2.0,"Although this a great value for the money and the items seem to have a high level of sturdiness, there are not 40 acrylic blanks in the package. I would not order again because it description is false and misleading."
2.0,"Did not care for this dress, didn't really stretch not look flattering, didn't look like the pics to me, looked very cheap. Ended up sending it back"
2.0,Lights came off first day had to regule
2.0,This item is not made well. The material is cheap and the torso part was way too short while the legs were way too long. The dimensions and proportions are way off.
2.0,"Too small and too narrow. I will return them, but they lool very nice."
2.0,My daughter loves them but trimming them down to fit her wrist makes it so they don't stay closed
2.0,Cool glasses however always attached to cord
2.0,"Very thin material.  Seems cheap.  Very see thru.  Only gave it 2 stars Bc it is a cute style.  Otherwise, it’s junk"
2.0,This shoe is unusually wide
2.0,Looking at reviews I went a size larger<br />It’s way too big ! Not happy
2.0,"I'm disappointed that these are actually acrylic and not glass.  The description says glass, but you can easily tell they are plastic as they are very lightweight and too &#34;perfect&#34; without any tiny bubbles so you know they are plastic.  They are lighter than my much small glass dome marbles and the quality is just not worth that high of a price.  But I will still keep them because for this project they will work anyway."
2.0,"Skirt was pretty and comfortable to wear but it arrived with a broken zipper.  There was not another in stock so I chose to take it to the cleaners for repair.  The whole zipper had to be replaced so by the time a added another $15.00 for the repair, the dress wasn't as good of a deal as I thought."
2.0,The pants are COMPLETELY See-through!!!! Like you cannot wear underwear plus the pants. Maybe a bathing suit but that’s about it.
2.0,"Really nice socks (color, texture, softness) but they shrunk in the first wash."
2.0,Came with little holes already in the seems
2.0,"this is a great idea, and first-rate materials and workmanship. the only problem i have is that there is very little room in the openings for the paddle shaft, so it's impossible to get the velcro parts to make up smoothly. it just needs to have bigger holes. the paddle i use them on has a fairly small shaft. i like the pogies a bit looser on the shaft, so that the velcro lays together nicely, and so i can slip some water in to lube up or move the blades relative to my grip.<br /><br />very easy in and out, and very warm in the 50 F and windy paddle today."
2.0,"I ordered the smallest size and it was so big! Literally was falling off of me! I am 125lb, 5'5&#34;, and a small. However, I did like how thin and breathable this is."
2.0,"Disappointed... I'm sure they're warm but the XL size gloves (if that's really what I got? it said so on the bag at least) are still too small on my hands, and the insulation makes them not very stretchy"
2.0,too slippery cant tie up and wont stay on head.
2.0,"Pant's were oddly cut. Tight in butt and loose in legs. They just didn't fit properly, but seemed to be good quality."
2.0,I love it but I bought an xl I am a large and it was too small. I am going to look into buying an XXL
2.0,"I didn't think this looked nearly as nice on me as it did in the photo.  Also, while the waist fit perfectly, I seriously would have to be a double DD chest in order for the chest to fit me.  I am a 36C and it was HUGE in the chest area, even though it fit fine around the middle.  So if you are smaller than a double DD, don't expect this to look good on the top.  The material will stick way out with nothing to fill it and it looks terrible that way."
2.0,"My face (or nose?) may be slightly larger than average, b/c it just didn't fit my face well...if it covered my nose then it was pushing into my lower lip...if it sat properly on my chin (below my lips) it barely reached the tip of my nose. Just bad luck for me, it seems to work for many others!"
2.0,"These glasses are generally fine, but the earpieces hit the lenses whenever they close and now both lenses have scratches on them.  I guess for the money I can't complain too much."
2.0,Way to large for children. It's was big enough for me to wear. I returned it. Cute and probably warm but way to big.
2.0,I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE MATERIAL.
2.0,"Years ago, I had a NorthFace beenie that I really loved and that fit my head nicely. So I was really hoping that this one would finally be the replacement I've been looking for. This one was really think, like three times thicker than the one I had lost. It was a little too long, and the seams were very prominent and hard to make it look good on me. I tried it on my kids and partner as well, but none of us looked nice in it. Kinda bummed, so have to return this one and keep searching."
2.0,"They feel awkward over my face - the front is staright, they aren't semi-round. They are pretty to look at and the case rocks, but not wearable, at least for me."
2.0,"For the price of this dress and  for Marvel to be sponsors  I expected much more. The colored parts of the dress are rubbery paint, making it feel heavy and awkward. Any stretching of the top breaks up the black of the bust. The material of the top and skirt are of different thickness, the top much thinner. Also, the stitching holding top and skirt together was exposed and appeared weak."
2.0,This was less of a maternity shirt & more of a belly shirt. To short!
2.0,"This is something an 80 year old woman might wear in the yard and it looks ok on the model in the picture, but it did NOT look cute on this 30-something. Large fit and bulky, if you can say that about a hat. Just a lot of fabric. Both my husband and co-worker said ""Oh gosh, take it off"" when I tried it on for them."
2.0,Fits okay but it is not as long as shown on the model. I am 5 7 and the pockets hit my waist.
2.0,Great bag expect there was a stain on it. Hope it comes out when washed.
2.0,The  tee shirt is made of a light weight jersey material.  I think a better quality shirt should be used since it is a Kawasaki item.
2.0,It is not midi dress. It reaches to the ground. Too long. Im 5 feet tall.
2.0,The girls one don't clip all the way and I lost the charm already just got it today.
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. But still like the dress. Weird material.
2.0,"The design is not even close to what is pictured. It's really a sweater, it's more of a shirt-like material. I ordered an x-small and got a small and its big for a small."
2.0,Not what I expected at all.  VERY small considering the title says oversized.  I can't fit a weekends worth of clothes much less one day.  Great style but too small for the price and what I wanted it for.
2.0,"These are VERY small bracelets. I have smaller than average wrists, and these were really snug on me. Also, I couldn't wear them with the satin gloves I'd planned for my outfit, because the metal had enough sharp corners around the inside of the bracelet that it snagged the gloves horribly."
2.0,They were ok but a pair came busted
2.0,"They are a very awkward fit. They are very soft. They are the quality and color I expected but I plan to shit back because the crotch is too long, super tight on my thighs, and the waist band is low. I am around a size 12 and the L/XL are TIGHT on me. There is no way they would stretch to a size 20."
2.0,"The gold foil on the dress is VERY VERY cheap! Careful because it was starting to come off when I got it. The dress is so pretty otherwise, but it’s NOT and I repeat NOT made for bigger boobs/butts. I’m a 42 DDD normally and I tried the dress on w/o a bra and it wouldn’t even come close to closing. Also not really made for curvier women.. like it made me look so much wider than I am because of the shape of the dress. I would not recommend this dress if you’ve got boobs, a butt or curves lol."
2.0,"Well let’s see I used it for about a month, normal use after the first time I used it at the beach! No water and everything was fine. Next day used it at the pool and water came inside the case , my phone was ruined. Had to buy a new phone after that sadly! During this month use I never opened or removed the case so it just normal wear made it leaked. Sad because I was looking forward to use this during my vacation"
2.0,ok for 1 time use
2.0,The costume is nice and I actually liked that the dress and cape were not a itchy mesh or net material. My only concern is that the horns were not glued on properly and were barely hanging on to the headband. I ordered this item twice and both packages had the same issue with the horns coming off of the head band. It was a hassle to return the second item as well and try a third time so I just glued the horns myself. The product must have sat on the shelves too long.
2.0,Way too big. Sent back and was refunded
2.0,A silly bracelet that is cheap looking.  I never really. Wore it after it arrived.
2.0,"I was so excited to get these fangs for a photoshoot but I'm so damn disappointed. First of all the teeth are not perfect like the image. The one I received has triangular gaps in the front. The teeth are kind of translucent and the whole piece doesn't lay flat in my mouth. My naturals poke out from under and if I move the mouth piece down it gives an unnatural gummy look. If you don't have any front teeth, these will probably work for you. I went off of the photo review and purchased these. I was going to return but I will be charged for it. Not worth the price."
2.0,The clasp to put the necklace on is way too small. Have a hard time every time and get aggrevated. The initial L does not look like an L. To me a piece seems to be missing to connect the bottom part to make it look like and L. Would not order or recommend his product again.
2.0,41 degrees add finger tips were freezing…and trust the other reviews…the fingers are long and oddly sized.
2.0,See previous review for images and video. Sleeves weren't right. It didn't feel right on like it doesn't sit well and it was too big overall but the top is unflattering.
2.0,"These shorts are fine, but only if you order at least one size bigger than your normal size,"
2.0,The fit is perfect and it’s nice but as I was putting it on I could hear seems popping. It was weird because I wasn’t forcing them on and they weren’t tight. Also they are super loose around the ankle. Still a nice material and very comfortable though.
2.0,wore out very quickly and the grippers are peeling off.
2.0,Was disappointed with the product. The tail is more creme than the colour pictured.
2.0,They aren’t meant for girls with big butts. Not very comfortable.
2.0,Not the best quality pendant...but it's fun.
2.0,The item was too small for me.
2.0,Not slim fit very loose. I am 5’10” weigh 163-165 lbs. Not a good fit for me. Quality and price fine. I returned it
2.0,"This was really cute, the tag itself was sturdy and I didn’t expect to have any problems with it. However, it broke off within two days. The item itself is nice, so if you purchase it I don’t recommend placing them on your keys which beats the whole purpose of it, but if your a huge fan maybe hang it up or keep it somewhere safe."
2.0,Fits small and the red sleeves bled when washed as directed on the label :(
2.0,I put one of them in my tragus and one in my helix. Tragus is doing fine but I had to take the one out of my helix bc it got so irritated! It was really hurting my ear!
2.0,The material is not what I expected and the fit is small
2.0,"The strap is a bit long for my 7&#34; wrist. With the way the loops are fixed, the strap may dangle out. I've read that some people here have cut them. Not a fan of this.<br /><br />In addition, the loops, being metal, have been hitting against my laptop. This is a bit irritating. And the more I look at it, I'm really not digging the the extra metal loops that come with the NATO style, especially that they're fixed.<br /><br />I'm not returning this only because of the watch tool that it came with."
2.0,it's like a bathing suit material.
2.0,I’m 5’7 and ripped the first pair trying to get them over my thighs.  The second pair was close to ripping.  Glad there were a few to toy with.  Wouldn’t buy from here again.  Not as silky as I was looking for.
2.0,"Very very cheap &#34;case&#34;. Doesn't even fit(too small) the note 3, which is what it is listed for. Also it is a totally different color. The picture shows it a cute cream/pink color while in reality it is bright white. And the shoe is purple.  Luckily the customer service rep was extremely courteous and promptly refunded my money.  Thanks"
2.0,"Thin, little big, but good quality and looks good."
2.0,"Listing states that these shorts are a 3"" inseam, but, they are, in fact a 5"" inseam!! The reason I ordered them is because of the 3"" inseam! I like my shorts...SHORT, not down almost to my knees! Not happy with the bait & switch tactics of this seller!!"
2.0,"Gloves keep your hands warm, but the fingers are not well insulated at all. I wore these outside in (positive) 30 degree F for 30 minutes and my fingers were freezing. I have no idea how these could even be remotely rated at 60 degrees below what I tested them in."
2.0,Was not a faded blue like the photo.  More like a bright blue
2.0,Several issues with glasses
2.0,"The color is much paler and lighter than in the picture. For once, an item is true to size, but the neck is so tight it’s choking me. Returning."
2.0,The color brown is different enough that I am having a hard time matching other browns. I would not recommend this for this color
2.0,This is a super cute shirt and very good quaility but extremely way to big. I can nor even wear it and I bought 2 of them.
2.0,Arrived totally wrinkled! Look very cheap!
2.0,Much larger than expected and the material is very thin.
2.0,Made for short and very thin people
2.0,Not all of the bands listed are for the Galaxy Fit. I bought the bands with the holes in them but they do not fit my Samsung Galaxy Fit (SM-R370). They appear to be for a Gear Fit instead. They have the same type of pins that you'd find on a regular watch band.
2.0,"They are fine glasses; sturdy and good sight.  Each has a case AND a dust bag.  However, the picture makes them look like each is colored differently and has a personality...  If you laid each one out in a row, mine all look basically alike.  The ""pattern"" is so faint you can't really tell it has a pattern (and that's with my regular readers on), and they all just look black.  They are fine for extra readers to have around, but they are certainly not FUN glasses I would wear in front of people."
2.0,Not so easy fit!!
2.0,The point of the very thought our bracelet is the circle. If you dont want the circle there are many other bracelets to chose from. on this one the best is the nice circle around the opposite colored bead on each bracelet. The black bracelet came broken. The circle ring was broken in the box. Very sad
2.0,"Somehow this dress is too small and too big at the same time.. chest area is way too open,like there's too much fabric and I'm a 38c. But I feel like in the hip to knee area it doesnt cover enough.  I really wish it fit because the pictures are so cute. Also, the fabric is a kind of rough textured fabric,  not soft and smooth.<br />For reference I wear a large top and bottom,  size 10 bottom"
2.0,Too was much too small.  Hat not sized accurately.  Other hat was ok.  Disappointed.  Not worth cost shipping  back to seller.  Pay more and get better quality
2.0,"This item was so tarnished - had I known how bad it was, I would not have even brought it into my house.  Yes, the price was low but having purchased a beautiful item from this vendor in the past, I was optimistic that this necklace would be satisfactory.  Epic fail!  I will not order from this company again. The only reason it did not get one star is that I limit my use of the word &#34;hate&#34;."
2.0,stone was loose in the setting
2.0,Very bulky on the wrist  and doesn't close properly so falls off a lot.
2.0,"this just kinda has an awkward fit. for me anyway. if you are a shorty like myself, you will likely find that this shirt hangs very boxy on you. perhaps it could do with a bit of tailoring in the midsection? i dunno. but unfortunately im returning it for the fit. the colors are very vibrant, though, which is a plus."
2.0,"The glasses are too big, they won't stay on. When they arrived the metal piece for over the nose was all bent out of shape; fixable, but I 'm returning anyway due to the size."
2.0,I'm 5'8 135 and these are waaayyy too short
2.0,"I will say that this item did come in as stated. This item was not of good quality.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but seriously I am disappointed"
2.0,I ordered a medium and the pants were still too big but I love the top.
2.0,"For what I paid ($50) I'm a little annoyed that another $11 had to be handed out for new clasps and fasteners. So know that you will probably be doing the same if you purchase these. Also, mine were previously purchased and returned. I wouldn't have known, but I found something in the bib pocket that tipped me off, a condom!"
2.0,Doesn’t seem to be the same quality as the other carhartt I bought at local store. Store one much better.
2.0,"Does not change tint in any light.<br />However, provides polarization and is helpful in low light and weather. The opening for the nose is rather narrow, so if your nose is not child sized these may ride higher than one would hope."
2.0,"These were weird. They did not sit on my face correctly. I couldn't wear them. Guess I shouldn't have expected much for $4, but you can get better ones at Old Navy for the same price"
2.0,"The charm was all silver, not silver and gold. Disappointed."
2.0,"Although they looked nice initially, I thought  the fleece would be thicker and found that I had a problem with it pilling."
2.0,"So, shipping was pretty fast I received it a day earlier than it said I would have been using it for 3 days and I noticed the iridescent stuff is starting to peel off. Very disappointed (but I knew this would happen since I read the other reviews) I just didn’t think it would happen so quickly. If it all peels of completely instead of chipping it’d be okay because the band underneath is white."
2.0,The top was poorly cut and sewn. The liner pads in the top are poorly postioned and the darting that shapes the cups in the top weren't finished well on the inside so there is the outline of extra material and thread that shows through when it's on. It's a cute design but whoever sewed the pattern together was really sloppy at their job. It's too bad because it would've been really cute. I feel like wasted my money.
2.0,"very uncomfortable, the lace tears easily."
2.0,The lenses lasted like 2 months. They started to peel off on the boarders.
2.0,"Super cute, but not even durable for basic everyday use. Handles tore right away. Clip broke on the satchel strap. I dont put a whole lot in my purse."
2.0,"The frame for the large lens pair of these glasses are made too small in proportion to the lenses. The design, better suits an individual with a smaller head."
2.0,Item tarnished very quickly and did not maintain original gold color for long. Turned to a rusty copper color after a week of wear
2.0,Itchy tags never work. The tags itch even when cut out. To completely remove them creates a hole. Otherwise they’d be perfect!
2.0,Only two stars!<br />Because the necklace had a couple<br /> rough pieces.  other than that it's okay.
2.0,"These are not comfy at all, feels more like they would be better suited for a childs face."
2.0,Snags VERY easily which sucks because I do like the fit and how soft it is but I’ve worn it twice and it’s almost too snagged to wear anymore. I wouldn’t buy it again
2.0,"I so wanted this vest, Ultimate Direction Womens Race Vesta 4.0, to be the ""one"". I liked that it comes down further than some of the other vests which seem to be more of a bolero style. But sadly, it just wasn't. After couple of sips from one of the flasks, the whole vest became loose and moved around. I had every one of the straps tightened as far as they could be tightened, so I couldn't tighten it any more. The flasks bounced with every step. It got progressively worse as I continued to sip from one flask to the next. The flasks sit on the upper chest, which was not comfortable for me (and I'm small chested!). The placement is odd because the vest has plenty of room below the chest to have pockets for the flasks, but that's not where they go! I think if they put the zip pockets up top and the flask pockets on bottom it would be PERFECT! Because it moved around so much, I got some pretty bad chafing along my neck that took two weeks to heal. I returned it and tried 2 more styles and kept the 3rd one. Although more expensive, it works better for me than this one."
2.0,"The quality of the leather was very disappointing. Rough,  leaving edges looking unclean and with ‘shaggy’ back. I paid much more for this pair as I was hoping for the quality product I wanted."
2.0,Too dark not as see able as picture
2.0,Fingers too long so touch screen did not work for me.  Comfort and softness good.
2.0,It was a good hat...but it didn't fit me. Very disappointing.
2.0,Cheap photo print
2.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for one of my kids so it was too late to send back but it's DRY CLEAN ONLY. I do not see that anywhere in the description unless I overlooked it somewhere. The fabric is very cheap so I doubt it will hold up well if we wash it anyway. I would have sent it back if I wasn't counting on it as a gift.
2.0,i ordered these pants for my autistic husky son. and although they fit great and are comfortable. i ordered the color NAVY and received ROYAL BLUE. which he is unable to wear to school.
2.0,"UPDATE 2: Another broken sock with the same time. From 3 to 2 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: One of the pairs broke within 2 months. They were only worn less than 20 times. Socks were worn on smooth surfaces.<br /><br />At first I was weirded out by these but, I got use to the individual toe covering. The grips work very well and socks are comfortable. Survived its first wash."
2.0,Pretty but cheap looking.
2.0,This is like a cheap costume material. Not at all what I thought. The length is nice but in order to wear it I'll have to wear a slip and a cover up. So disappointed.
2.0,Warm coat but zipper broke after a few times of wearing.
2.0,Not real leather. Smells like petroleum. Obviously not real.
2.0,This bra definitely has an odd fit to it...I am a 36C and normally wear either a medium or large in sports bras. Based on some of the other reviews I decided to order up a size so I got a 38C...the band fit okay but the front part of the bra just felt like it was smashing the girls down. This did not give me any sort of shape while wearing and was not flattering in the least bit. It will be going back
2.0,"Received this dress. It's basically a t-shirt dress with a hem that goes up on one side. There is no ruching, which is how it looks in pics. I'm 5'1, 113 lbs. it's too long and too loose. I will have to make modifications in order to wear it."
2.0,Love the elastic and the colors. NO WAY TO ADJUST! If you have fat wrists you are SOL. One  size fits MOST
2.0,Pattern is nice. Fit was flattering. The material is not great and has sheen.
2.0,I bought a letter D and its on the wrong side 😒
2.0,Those were too long :(
2.0,The hats were bent a little all around the brim of the hat.
2.0,"My daughter received this as a gift. She got a 5T which is her correct size. The head hole is way to small though, so it can't fit over her head. Very disappointing."
2.0,Wish.com china u get what u pay for lol
2.0,Does what’s its supposed to do. The zippers get stuck quite often and it came right out of the box with a scratch on it that I can’t get off. It’s a workable walllet. But I’ve ordered one of better quality.
2.0,Nice mask but too big for my kids.
2.0,The button that holds the flap down came off its string within the first 15 minutes of having them on. I still wear them but I'm just a little disappointed.
2.0,a size smaller would be a better fit
2.0,Broke within two days
2.0,Baugh as a gift. Was smaller than expected. The wrist fits because she’s really thin but the watch looks like it’s more for toddlers rather than pre teens. It was also felt cheap.
2.0,Looks like you would get it from one of those things you put quarters in and get a little plastic prize from. Feels better than it looks though. Honestly was embarrassed to give it to my best friend for Christmas.
2.0,not very happy with it--all polyester and not very comfortable
2.0,Talles muy grandes. No los puedo usar
2.0,Didn't realize these were so small.......
2.0,Thought i would buy a bigger size so it would be roomy. But it fits way to small.
2.0,"The package brought only 2 suction cups, and only 1 worked correctly (the other came bended and didn't attached)."
2.0,"I own a few different pairs of swim boxers, so I know how they should fit. I reviewed the Amazon sizing reference for these and purchased according to that, which is generally correct, but they are way too small. I am 140 pounds and a 29-30 inch waist (trim but not buff) and ordered a small. A medium would *probably* work. Other than the sizing, the style was okay, not great but not bad either. If they fit, it would have been a good value at $6.99."
2.0,"These bows are super cute and exactly as pictured, but the band left a mark on my newborn's head. She was only 7 lbs, so I wasn't expecting them to be too tight. Kind of disappointing since they are so cute and I expected them to last for a while."
2.0,Thought i was getting alot more for the price.
2.0,"I returned mine, fits a bit small. I typically wear a size large and ordered the XL and it was still snug."
2.0,"My order just arrived today and when I look at it, I saw right away the thread. It wasn’t sew properly. I am expecting that a $15 is a decent one. It just looks good on the picture but not in person. Just disappointed. What a waste of money. Urgh! 😩"
2.0,I should have read the description better. This is a very small sword. More for a costume. Not what I had anticipated.
2.0,"I usually wear a Medium so I ordered the shirt and it fit perfectly. It is a nice light fabric. It wrinkles but is easy to iron. After about 5-6 washes, the shirt started to look very worn and doesn't have much life left in it."
2.0,"It's cute, but not what I was expecting. It looks cheap and bends easily. To me, it's not worth the buy."
2.0,Looked cute for the first few wears. Then it began to tarnish and smell weird.
2.0,One of the scrubber 'nubs' fell out and now my hand gets wet inside the glove when I use it. So: unusable
2.0,This dress is so gorgeous but definitely needs some work. The stitching isn’t the best. The fit was okay. I felt like if I went down one size the dress would have been to small but in the size I got there were some areas that were very loose. Unfortunately it made me look very shapeless because there isn’t much waist definition so I ended up not actually wearing it. I bought this for a small backyard wedding and it would definitely be great for that if you can get a size that fits you.
2.0,"If you are planning on wear tools or a gun with this belt, don't. It will not stay tight and the material is thin. The velcro belt stay is more of a pain in the butt than it is helpful. I wear tools all day and bought this belt because the quick release makes it easier when you need to use the restroom."
2.0,The color is nothing like the picture. The picture is mint or pale greenish/blue and the item that arrived is intense green
2.0,"I have a bigger bottom than top and by the time I got it over my hips, the cute, tiny waist was ripped.  It's very cute on, just difficult to get on."
2.0,"Beautiful material, but even the very largest size could not even begin to cover my chest, and I'm a D cup. Very sad, I really loved the color and material. I wish it had worked."
2.0,"The small fit like a medium, and there was no option for an extra small. If you are short this dress will hit you below the knees rather than at mid-thigh like it is shown in the picture."
2.0,Material not the best. Not good for thick chicks.
2.0,The outfit fits and looks great but the blues are not the same in the top and bottom!
2.0,"The colors are pretty, but there's no way to stop it from unloosing. I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"Really cute, but These run wayyyyy too big"
2.0,Probably not really stainless steel.....these HAVE to be nickle or at least part nickle based on how bad of a reaction I had to them.
2.0,"The picture is super cute, however you have to be super careful with screw on jewelry because if you screw it on and it skips a thread you have a very hard time taking them back out. Mine skipped one of the threads and I had to go to a piercing shop to have them remove it."
2.0,Fairly flimsy and not exactly helpful for covering up or support. Cute back though.
2.0,"I ordered the bright colored set, but received grey and black. They are also not true to the measurements"
2.0,"Hat came in crushed. The package was not damaged and plenty big for this, which means they shipped it out knowing it looked like this. Glasses were adorable."
2.0,"I bought these to sleep in, but they're super uncomfortable. I ordered according to the size chart, but they're super tight. Like, I know yoga pants are supposed to be tight but these are ridiculous. I couldn't even pull them up to slightly below my belly button and they gave me the biggest freaking camel toe I've ever seen, ok. Yeah, no. Also super thin material and I can tell if my cats even glance at them wrong, they're going to get those little snags all over. My suggestion is to order at least one size bigger than what you need, and don't buy these if you have kitties because they won't last."
2.0,I ordered a size 10-11 years and received a 8-9 years old. It’s a cute robe it’s super soft but it’s way too small for my 10 year old. It looks Like even if it was the 10-11 years it would still be too small. It’s true to European size 10-11 years. I’m not going to send it back I’ll gift it to another little kid I guess....
2.0,I really wanted to like these but there nothing like I thought they would be they don't feel like pants at all they fit weird and I'm just really disappointed.
2.0,It's smaller then expected.  Tight fit on arms makes it hang oddly.
2.0,Dislike the color too long needs hemming
2.0,"For $10, I should be nearly as annoyed by this as I am; however, after seeing this dress in an ad on FB and falling in love with it, I am admittedly very disappointed.<br /><br />My coveted dress arrived today, and I anxiously tore open the packaging, which was nothing fancy: a padded envelope, with the dress in a sealed plastic bag with the tags attached.<br /><br />Lo and behold, as I'm preparing to try it on, I notice one of the buttons seems loose. Upon further inspection, I realize that it is attached merely by a safety pin. Theoretically, this could be a fashion trend I'm oblivious to, but I've never been one to follow fashion. I'm also not remotely knowledgeable on how to sew a button on (HomeEc was a thing of the past when I was in middle school).<br /><br />Now I'm stuck returning this otherwise adorable dress, with the caveat that an adult must be home for UPS to pickup the package during a business day, which is another aggravation.<br /><br />Also, I'm a 5'4, 140ish lbs and a 36 big B, small C, and the girls were ready to pop right out of the size M dress I purchased. Otherwise, the material seems sturdy and it's not a horrible piece for $10."
2.0,"The band itself is very nice.  But one of the spring bars was too small.  I had extra spring bars, but the clasp on the quick release makes it a pain to remove."
2.0,This bra is pretty but has no side support whatsoever--I was informed that it is especially made for those who have had breast surgery.
2.0,Very flimsy fabric but snugg for med.
2.0,I was really disappointed in this dress.  I am 5' 8&#34; and wear a 36C and this dress was so tight across my chest and extremely short.  I returned it because there was no way I could ever wear it in public because of how short it was!
2.0,"The dress is made out of a weird material. I've tried it on once, but had to immediately take it off because where the top meets the bottom the material pokes into my skin."
2.0,The shirt was way to short!!!
2.0,It’s misshapen at the hips almost like they were going to put in pockets and forgot I don’t think it’s bad enough to ruin the look…just a little iffy It is also much duller then it appears in the photo. It is stretchy but the hips are just off a bit. The pattern is nice and the top half is pretty.
2.0,Short legs in proportion to the size and overall height. The batons are too far apart and legs are narrow. It opens up in between each baton in legs. Also they are very easily opened so not good for crawling babaies.
2.0,"Loved the shoes.  Very pretty and they fit fairly well.  Would have kept them,  but the pair I received were defective. The left shoe was sewn with the lacey material higher over the foot than the right. I returned them and to my disappointment when I tried to reoreded they did not have my size. Amazon had the same shoe through another company but at double the prize. Not going to pay for the same shoe and pay double. :("
2.0,"These are very odd feeling on. They wear VERY low and have absolutely no support. If you bend over they slide right down your butt and I didn't get a size that was too small for me either. The legs fit well but the elastic around the hip portion was completely ineffective.  I would not reccomend these to anyone, im sending them back."
2.0,"These are really cute, but they're not 8mm."
2.0,"Nice shirt, and have gotten compliments on it, but...the fabric is such that it snags on the least little thing and pulls appear immediately.  After just one time, there are pulled threads all over the lower part of the sleeves where I just leaned on something."
2.0,"I dislike the inside stitching. It felt like something was constantly touching me, brushing my skin. I didn't like that feeling"
2.0,Didn't look as vibrant in person. The  material looks cheap to me.Appears to more of a faded black color
2.0,The yellow is more of a dull mustard.  It was very thin and wrinkled and didn't hang attractively.
2.0,Looked good in pictures but when it arrived it felt cheap and chain broke when I tried to put on
2.0,"I loved the colors, fit, and fabric weight but the fabric started pilling just after 2 washes."
2.0,"Very pretty design, but smaller than advertised and the fabric is like fluid plastic. I like at least a little natural fiber."
2.0,Not nearly as nice as photo. Too small and too tight. Very thin easily worn material.
2.0,"Looks like great quality! Looked so nice the first time my husband wore it, and then the neck ripped before he could wear it a second time. Disappointing."
2.0,"The first thing that was asked after opening, ""Why is it so thin?"" Honestly, doesn't look like the ""ring"" in my book. Would not order again."
2.0,Actually says “sample text.” WHY?
2.0,"Colors, pattern detail look nothing like the photo. 💔"
2.0,"Looks nice but very small for a medium, probably will nerves wear."
2.0,"Nice material, looks like to would last a long time.<br /><br />There are two things that I consider design flaws that render it useless to me:<br /><br />1) One end of the straps is a loose clip that frequently comes away from the loop that it connects to, necessitating reattachment.<br /><br />2) The main compartment cannot be easily accessed without removing one end of the straps.<br /><br />Too much time would be wasted on these repetitive tasks to make this useful and justify the high cost.<br /><br />Also, the zippers are difficult to operate.  It appears to be because of the great water resistant seals over the zipper, but since I care more about using this quickly in fair weather as a sports bag I consider this a detractor."
2.0,"These socks are well-made, but they are way too tight for me to give them a better rating."
2.0,Not at all what I expected!  gives the impression of being authentic african material and it is NOT!
2.0,"This is gorgeous and I loved wearing it, but after 10 days I got a bad allergic reaction! My piercing area swelled up and is all red and painful, this happens when I'm allergic to metals. I can only wear real gold. Clearly this isn't real, or is just a thin coat and wears off after a week. If you have sensitive skin, keep looking...if not, it really is beautiful!"
2.0,"The product description says that the dress has pockets. The one I received does not. Also, it’s about an inch too short. I can see my feet when I wear it which I don’t like when I wear maxi dresses. I can wear it with flats but it still feels just a tad too short."
2.0,This dress was not made from a comfortable material and did not look like it does on the model in the picture shown. Very disappointed as I was hoping for a cute new black dress.
2.0,"Fits perfect. Delivered within a few days. Looks great. Adjusting this review after using them for a few weeks.... the bottom is made of a foamy material that sucks up even the smallest amount of water so your feet are soaked even from light dew in the ground. Also, the ridges on the bottom are also on the inside of the shoe for some reason, so after wearing for maybe a dozen times and the fluff inside gets matter,  the ridges come up and really hurt feet.<br /><br />You get what you pay for I guess. They look nice at least."
2.0,My hat was crumpled when i got it.  i cannot get the front to be without a crimp.<br /><br />As it turns out it not worth the price.
2.0,In the picture this watch looks great.  Love the look.  Unfortunately when I received the watch the face of the watch was orange.  Not attractive at all.  I returned it.
2.0,I usually spend $60+ for a sports bra & didn't want to spend a lot of money this time. Sometimes you get what you pay for. This does nothing for my D cup.
2.0,"I wish the description of this item would have said this product has been heavily used.  Judging from the post, and picture, one would think they would be shiny & new.  I guess it doesn't matter TOO much with collar stays... but I don't like used items."
2.0,It's a little to small
2.0,"It's cute, just too small and I ordered a size large. I'm giving it to my teenager to wear. She wears size small women's."
2.0,"Nice design, but the description says it's adjustable and i definitely is NOT.  Even still, this bra is not a high performance and not for heavy chested women."
2.0,Very disappointed in material of pants and scarf
2.0,I was disappointed expected to receive a satin cap but label on product started polyester ...
2.0,Clasp will not stay connected to band. Pin keeps coming out
2.0,"I always liked these designs ... on the comp screen that is ... when received, the pair looks quite cheap with the white interior, as if they didn't bother to print the right color.  Also, beware guys, there's more pink in this design than appears in the product shots ... too feminine .. won't wear 'em."
2.0,The shirts are completely see-through. I can literally see my belly button through them. I am returning them. Definitely not worth what I paid.
2.0,returned the item it was somewhat small and looked much better online than in person
2.0,The band is beautiful. I purchased 2. One has already fell apart. The other is fine
2.0,"The jersey is nice. However, the length of the jersey is about 6” to long. I dont want my keys or phone etc hitting my seat while riding. Love the pattern - though I’m very disappointed in the fit. Sadly, it’s going back."
2.0,Nice accomplishment for students involved. Wish I could have seen what the illustrations looked like before purchasing. It was not what I thought it would be and I would not have purchased had I known the cat was just cut from each painting.
2.0,"I know, if you pay a low price, you'll get a low quality item, and that's it here.  Didn't like them for a wedding, so I returned it.  The seller was great, though!  Very prompt with the return label and the reimbursement."
2.0,Had to return these unfortunately because they were not the American sized pants
2.0,"First off, the sizing is a bit off. I normally wear medium/lg in tops, blazers, and jackets but this is pretty tight on the back and arms. The fabric is super thin and flimsy and wrinkles easily (feels kinda like linen) the colors are not nearly as opaque as they appear in the picture and it's not very flattering. There are also a BUNCH on loose strings along the seams. The price of this (26.99) was WAY too high for this quality. The only reason I might keep this is because I live in the south and hot humid weather is common so I could painstakingly wear this during any time of year considering how thin it is. Honestly, not worth it"
2.0,"So small, you can't get the lenses in front of both eyes to see through them."
2.0,The dress is beautiful and I received lot of complements.  I wore this dress to my son's wedding on August 15th 2020 ordered it on August 5th and received it in a timely manner. 2 hours into the wedding the dress was completely ripped in the back all the way down. There was nothing I could do I'm at my son's wedding didn't have a backup dress so I had to enjoy his wedding with my dress ripped. I will not buy this dress again because it didn't live up to my son's wedding. I think I should received a refund because I was not able to enjoy my son's wedding.
2.0,It fits different than Showed in the picture
2.0,"I love the print design on these socks, but they fit way too tight on me.  I realize that these are compression socks, but I do have large calves, and even though I ordered the size that should have fit my calves, they were still too tight.  They made my legs ache after just a few minutes.  I have other compression socks that do not do this.  Disappointed because again, I did really love the print and they seemed to be of good quality."
2.0,Ordered this because apparently every seller of the watch refuses to keep spare chargers around....When i received this it was in great condition (new) but did not come with a chord and when i plugged it with my chords it failed to charge my watch. I tried multiple chords and still nothing. Fast shipping though....that's what saved this from a 1 star review.
2.0,I was disappointed to see that 1/2 of this band is black Velcro! This is the exposed part!<br />Too bad. Actually it is pretty junky.
2.0,I bought this wallet before and it lasted a few days before the mechanism broke. I got a replacement and the mechanism fell apart within 24 hours. Only loaded it with 2-3 cards and opened the cards maybe 3 times.<br /><br />I was able to put it back together and glue it so it functions correctly but you definitely get what you pay for.
2.0,"It’s a cute cardigan but the material isn’t the best, it’s kinda rough and scratchy but not enough to make me want to return it."
2.0,"I'm 5'4, 135lbs, athletic build, with a short torso and this didn't work for me at all. I gave it to a friend who's 5'9 but it still was ill-fitting and unflattering. The top/front is uneven and appeared to be off-center. Since it's beyond the return date, I'll donate it to a GoodWill store. Or perhaps use it later for a costume."
2.0,The solar battery doesn’t hold a charge.  I have to take off and put it in the sun about every two weeks.
2.0,"This is not a silk mask, it’s like a basketball jersey material. That being said, I still really like it..I’m just frustrated it’s not what was advertised."
2.0,"The store that offers these is clear that no two are alike and they don't guarantee which colors of tourmaline your necklace will have.  The one I received was dull and brown.  It is strung on string - which I knew - but it came in a little tiny package - I presume to save on postage - all bunched up - I had a hard time getting it to even lay flat enough to try on.  It felt icky in my hand like it wasn't clean.  I realize now that I &#34;should have&#34; sent it back, but I didn't.  Just a few brighter tournaline stones, would have improved this necklace a lot.  I since bought another elsewhere and will probably never wear this one."
2.0,"I am 5'5"" Size 36HH/36L bra, 240 lbs. The top of the dress was a sexy hourglass fit, accentuating my boobs and waist. The dress is stretchy but the slit makes it not wearable for women with thick thighs. I looked like a mermaid with half of the front cut out. It may look good on someone endowed on top and small hips and thighs. The slit is not on the side as in the description. It is slightly off center and runs along the front of the right thigh. It is opaque, but I still recommend solid color undergarments. Unfortunately, it did not work for me and I am out of the return window."
2.0,Fits nice in the waist and lower body but the but is made for someone small busted because it smushed ypu chest with no support.
2.0,One sandal was larger than the other and the size and support were larger than expected.  Returned then after 2 days.
2.0,"No bad for what it is, but it wasnt great either.  They stretched out after one use and is garbage now."
2.0,I’m usually a l or xl . Amazon recommended M based on customers reviews and it definitely fit like a medium. Order your regular size . If you are heavy chested this top is not for you. SUPER tight from the top and loose from bottom.
2.0,"It seemed to be of a decent quality, but it didn't fit as expected."
2.0,"I loved everything about this bag.  The size is perfect for me, multi pockets, big yet easy to carry.  The color is awesome and the price was good.  Sadly, I have to give 2 stars because I have only had it 5 months and already the inside pockets and lining ripped and no, I did not stuff it nor put anything in it that would cause such a problem.  Having spent hours trying to find the perfect purse and thought I had with this one I can only give a big sigh as I go on the hunt once again"
2.0,This thing stinks!!! It smells so bad I didn't want to try it on. The quality is not bad for the price however it had threads hanging all over and the sleeves were extremely tight! I am petite 5' 1&#34; with small breasts and a big butt. The top was extremely tight and the bottom was loose! Very weird fit! To make it look good it would need to be altered. The lace is pretty but there are no tags to indicate how to wash it to get the stinch out!! I have an event coming up this week that I needed this for but it may be going back! Btw I ordered a small.
2.0,"These show to be a ""3D"" sewn style and instead are sewn like home made pleated at the edge of masks. Not consist between the 2. Cute, but mislead by photos"
2.0,I had to return the coat.top fit fine however from the forearm to the wrist was to tight for my liking
2.0,"You definitely get what you pay for. Although the sunglasses look decent, once you feel it and put it on, you know these are really cheap sunglasses. The frame feels like they are about to break and the lenses are so thin that they like the old red & blue 3-D glasses. It's that embarrassing. If you are shooting a movie and need sunglasses as a movie prop, these are just the ticket. For everyday use, no thank you."
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for, but it was ripped before my daughter even had a chance to use it. Just got it out to get ready for her first day of preschool tomorrow and noticed a 2” rip at the seam on the side. Would not recommend buying from this company, very poor quality."
2.0,Too small. the sizes don't match with USA sizes. I gave it to a friend.
2.0,Hurts my nose when I swim and fog up bad.
2.0,Bought this for my 6 year old boy since it had both the analog and digital face on it and thought that would be perfect for learning to tell time.  The face is large enough for my husband.  I'm returning the watch.  This watch shouldn't show up under &#34;boys&#34; watch.
2.0,The 2X was WAY too small in the hips and thighs. Definitely not a flattering look on my size 18-20 body.
2.0,"This suit fit and looked great until I got in the water. The modesty cups were seen very well when wet and the &#34;tummy control&#34; actually accentuated my belly, not flattering at all."
2.0,Shirts are extremely small. Like meant for children. I’m a bra size 38D and they barely cover me
2.0,I used to buy Russell Athletic sweat shirts all the time but the collars are a lot bigger now. I don't care for the big loose collars. Maybe It will be ok for people with big heads or big necks. I guess I have to find another sweat shirt brand.
2.0,Got a 2XL and it's the size of a small. It says it's adult size but it seems like it's more kid fit
2.0,It feels a little cheap! Does not look high quality. Does the job adequately enough.
2.0,The actual material of the dress was not as nice as the picture depicted.
2.0,not big enough!
2.0,[[VIDEOID:d7f4872015b8f61cffd8dbc2a21259bb]] I've had this for a month within the first 48hrs the fuzzy ball came apart from the card holder I used it once since I bought it and 2 weeks ago the clip fell off! It's cheaply made and a waste of money
2.0,The stems on these go past where they should. These might be great for someone with a wide head but I wouldn’t recommend for a normal size head.
2.0,"I really dislike having to write reviews about items like this one, but this shirt is not the kind of quality that I expect to receive. There are so many loose threads that there is absolutely no way that I can wear this shirt. I still have the tags on, so it's not like I threw it in the wash and it came out like this. This is just how it looked when I recieved it.<br /><br />It is very poorly made, and although the style is cute and fairly comfortable, there is no way I can recommend this shirt. I'm pretty disappointed, but I hope that if anyone decides to give this shirt a try, that they don't receive one that looks like mine."
2.0,not all the pieces were in the package.  would not order again.
2.0,The earnings were perfect untill i wore them on the seconday and the latch broke on both of them now i cant wear them. If it had broken i would have hiven 5 stars insted of 2.
2.0,"These are cute, little summer bracelets.  The colors are bright and the charms are nice, although very poorly made and already tarnishing.  The real issues I have with these are that the way the bracelets synch to secure on the wrist leaves at least an inch of the strand hanging off both sides of your arm.  They are also a huge pain to secure by yourself.  The other problem is the dyes used on the strands.  As soon as they get wet, which they will if you are washing your hands like you should, the dyes run and stain your skin.  These are besides the fact that the charms are very poorly made.  Definitely not worth the time, effort, and money."
2.0,I'm a slender person and I didn't think the legs would be as baggy as they are for my frame.
2.0,"The color is exactly as pictured, very pretty. However material is quite itchy and the sleeves are also pretty short. For comparison I usually wear a medium but I wanted an oversized look so I got a large and the length covered my bum but the sleeves barely made it to my wrist. If I reach for something the sleeves are half way up my forearm."
2.0,Strange fit - I returned them
2.0,I'm 5'7 at 220lbs a normal size 16. I purchased a XXL and it's too small. Great quality dress just small.
2.0,It doesn't look at all as it looks on picture
2.0,"The fit is okay, but I had hoped to be able to put a jacket over it and wear it to work. Unfortunately, the length is too short, and the neckline too deep for office attire. Haven't worn it yet, but maybe will use for a summer evening casual gathering."
2.0,"This shirt claims to be a medium, but is really a large or bigger. I'm also not confident that this material won't pill like crazy after several washes, seemed cheap."
2.0,Love the purse itself! Perfect size for day to day carrying and fits basic essentials easily. Zipper compartments are nice also. Unfortunately the zipper to one of the compartments broke just after my 30 return period was up. Disappointed that the purse didn't last longer.
2.0,"Tarnished so quickly...  2 of the bars had the ball welded to it so you can't even put it in... Its also not accurately gauged so it's kind of tight in my belly button..Overall, I'm pretty disappointed"
2.0,Didn't realize it was so small.
2.0,"The dress is not as pictured. I read reviews and decided I'd try it out... if you're in question, don't buy! The material is very synthetic no cotton at all and has quite a sheen to it. Cheaply made. The image shown is also a lot darker than the dress is in reality the dress shown in the picture doesn't have nearly as much white as the dress I received. You can also clearly see stitching around the sleeves and neckline. The material is very stretchy like a bathing suit. The fit was not bad. Size as ordered. I am 5'7&quot; and weigh 160 and ordered a large."
2.0,Open back gets caught on everything. Not safe. But a nice ring. Looks good.
2.0,Tassels fell apart first time I washed it
2.0,"I love the colors, but when I tried them on they were way to big.  I am typically a 7.5... On the crocs.com website the video said to size up and the written description said to size down... so when chatted with a c.s. rep, she said ""wide foot, go up, narrow go down""  I have a wide foot... The extra white and the slight 'mushroom' @ the heel makes these look gigantic...  not to mention the weight of it... a bit bulky... then the toe is long too... like you'd have to have long toes ... so not a fan... not sure even a 7 would look right... b/c it is a bit narrower on the front end... and also making it look heavier @ the back...  fan of the Crocs... not this shoe"
2.0,very thin and cheaply made. material is thinner than a teeshirt.  too expensive for the quality.  probably won't wear it again.
2.0,These loosen so quick... I lost both of them very quickly since you have to check it so many times a day.
2.0,Flimsy. Wish they had a sleeveless beefy tee which is what I searched for. Very disappointed.
2.0,"midway through my 4th run the plastic latch broke...while I was in the middle of a run...it was very unfortunate.  The fit was great and I wanted this to be my go-to running bra, but unfortunately the quality just isn't there."
2.0,Quality is good but the cups are wayyyy too small. Needs to be separates if you have a large chest.
2.0,This is not a warm jacket at all! The sleeves are to long for the size I ordered. You can't wear gloves with it comfortable because the sleeves are to skinny. And I have average arms. I am disappointed with the purchase! The collar comes up to high on the jacket. It touches your ears but not long enough to cover and it won't fold down. Disappointed!!
2.0,This ring was crudely made
2.0,Feels too heavy on my nose - not comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
2.0,VERY Thin material!  Not typical linen more a very thin tunic.  I normally wear a large but bought XL because of price and maker.  Skin tight!!
2.0,Bought this for my daughter for her Birthday and the first time she wore it a dolphin fell off. I wanted the three dolphins because she has three sons. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Its comfortable to wear in summer. Definitely not for winter as its thin material. This Pjs are big. I am 27 weeks pregnant weighing 160 pounds and large still fit me like dress on stick, so I had to return it. If you are truly big build then may be its good for you."
2.0,"I hadn't worn it yet, was showing my husband how pretty the butterfly was; when the black cords started coming out! Very cheaply made! Guess you get what you pay for. I put the butterfly on a regular necklace & it still just doesn't feel right. So I have to go hunting for a necklace big enough to look good with it. They also package it with the black cords bent up in a small clear bag. Boo."
2.0,poorly sewn and too small
2.0,Beautiful dress but received with a hole in the seam under chest. Returned it; won’t be rebuying..costs too much for it to have holes.
2.0,"This does not look the same in person. The neck is tighter, and the shoulder holes are small so the sleeves don't fall."
2.0,"I like style and fit but the color is not what expected. I ordered green and it is a light lime green,not an attractive color and it had taken to long to arrive."
2.0,It fit fine but everyone at the Halloween party knew it was me because my face was clearly visible
2.0,the colors are vibrant.  the material is thick and its hard/ stiff like a tablecloth.
2.0,"Bought for my mom, she loved it but it broke before she got a chance to wear it."
2.0,Too tight in one area too big in another.
2.0,"Had to return this dress. I am 5'6&#34; and normally wear a size 10 in dresses, so I ordered an XL. I could get the dress on, but the cut was weird. The bust was super tight and kind of squished everything downward, and the waist seemed higher in the front than in the back, so the bottom of the dress draped out in a really unflattering way. I didn't wear it out -- too afraid it would look like I'm pregnant!!<br /><br />I wasn't unrealistically expecting some stunning masterpiece for this price, but the detail work on the top is cheaper than expected. It is kind of like a fish net fabric with papery flowers sewn on, some of which were sliced in half in strange places. Too bad! The bottom of the dress is cute, but the top half was just completely bad."
2.0,Assumed it was like a true flannel however no collar.
2.0,"This top is ADORABLE, but I can only give it two stars because it arrived signifigantly smaller than described. I feel the large would best fit a size 6 or smaller. If you're that size, this tunic will be awesome!"
2.0,Lovely product…if your 1 size is a size O…I am a 4/6…way too small…
2.0,These felt cheap and not something that felt solid on my face.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,"I definitely checked twice to make sure I ordered the 6mm studs, and received 8mm studs instead. The 6mm are what I use now, and the 8mm are too long.<br />I am glad to have 16g replacement balls, they are the right size and needed them anyway."
2.0,Was not happy with quality of item.  Seem cheap n light weight was questioning if ring was real. I end up getting a better ring from Zales.com
2.0,Had to send it back as the glass was not clear - there was a kind of &#34;shadow&#34; in it.
2.0,"For $13, this is a fun little mystery bag.  I didn't expect much and I shouldn't have expected much.  I received 2 dresses and a skirt.  I generally don't wear either so this was already kind of a let down but everything ran so small, I wouldn't be able to wear any of it anyway.  For the record, I am 5'5' and 115lbs so I ordered small and I have to wonder if medium would have even fit.  The quality of the clothes is okay, maybe a little better than I would expect for the price.  In the end, I donated everything but it was a fun experiment and if you are more open to skirts and dresses than I am. this could be a huge success.  Just remember to order up at least one size!"
2.0,The ring dose not look like the picture scared to wear it because it looks like cheap times so very disappointed
2.0,"Gloves are NOT real leather as advertised!  Also, the lining is not sewn in and pulls out with your fingers.  They were cheap and not worth shipping back."
2.0,"Only 18&#34; long when most other hair tubes are 19 1/2 &#34; long. It also curls on the ends, so it shortens it even more. I was unable to keep it tucked under my vest when riding my motorcycle, and my hair would come flying out. I am thinking of sewing two together."
2.0,lasted a week before falling apart
2.0,The fit would be fine if I had skinny arms
2.0,"This got nothing 2 hold its down_ And Id was thinking its was 1- 2 _But not !_Id tie its in a knot! Still is not nothing!!<br />This nothing_But a piece of material cloth<br />material fabrics_ I'd now needs 2 see wat -I'd can make out of its now, or with its  ..Wow"
2.0,"Nice quality and very nice to have cheater section for reading.<br /><br />Update 7 Months later: With casual light duty use,  the rubber cushions  where the glasses rest against your nose, have become very mushy, seem to be breaking own, and pulling away from the frame of the glasses. I'm very disappointed with how they have held up. :("
2.0,"Fit is not as outlined in size chart.  Item arrived way late.  Worst part is the mildew/mold smell...transferred to skin.  Seem to be made ""out of balance"" e.g. the fingers down fit the rest of the glove.  Will try to freshen them up with drying sheets.  If this doesn't work will need to return.  Sign me very disappointed.  Suggest you pass on this item (seller?)."
2.0,This is way too tight it hurts my ears.
2.0,"Watch came in very nice box. On opening I noticed a slight damage on the blue part of the bezel finish. I had a heck of a time trying to set time, date and day. Instructions in included booket did not show this particular watch model."
2.0,"The short sleep/cap sleeve version of this is great, but this version the material is different - almost polyester-like.  Not attractive or comfortable...  unfortunate.  The cap sleeve version is totally worth it and looks/feels great!  Have it in many colors..."
2.0,The dress came and it fit very loose and big.
2.0,"too long and too small as well, the waistline is too small and the rest is entirely too big on me, I am 5'4&#34; and a half and and it goes half way down my calf's that is not where i expected it to be even halfway up my chest i have to say it was not what i expected."
2.0,"Great quality. Bought a medium and it would fit an extra large!!!! Runs really, really big!!"
2.0,"I order this dress for work;  as all I own is black, or brown. Wanted to spruce up some. I am 5,8"" 1/4. I weigh 170 and normally wear a size 10 or 12 depending on the product. I ordered a larger size to be loose fitting and at or below my knees.  The dress was at least 2 inches above my knee. I am 60+ and that is not what I perceive as a professional dress. I returned the dress."
2.0,Theses are very pretty but the post are very long which makes them uncomfortable.
2.0,I bought this first of all thinking that it was a pair of earings not just one. It was a very cheap earing though.
2.0,"This dress is pretty and seems to be well-made, except that the pattern is way off-center and the white is too sheer. Super disappointed."
2.0,"The product looks nothing like the photo. It’s still a comfy dress, but was not very excited to see that it literally was not like that photo."
2.0,These are sheer and t<br />He legs roll
2.0,Ok for a stacker!
2.0,like the fabric but doesn't stay put so useless as a face cover
2.0,"A little too big and long, covers my rear, I have wide shoulders and a long torso. Pink shirt is like high visibility pink!<br />No matter what laundry tricks I use the shirt stinks after just a few wears."
2.0,It’s water resistant at best. I was caught in a very mild shower and found myself soaked under the jacket. Couldn’t return as I didn’t discover the issue until after the 30 day period
2.0,Shirts fit great but shirt was too long. Had to return
2.0,"Tanks look very nice. The material is very low-cost. They are not true to size. If you order you definitely want to go a size if not too, depending on how much flexibility you like. This was very disappointing."
2.0,It runs very large and it has questionable quality
2.0,"Very thin material. Bottom of sweater is small and tight while the top was large and I'm typical in shape proportions. THe bottom of the sweater was so tight that it was stretched across my hips and looked awful. Wanted to like it, but had to return it."
2.0,the chicken faded off :( its pink now and i use gentle enzyme soap...no bleach or harsh soaps.  the decal just about washed off & it could be i just got a defected one? i dont know but nothing is worse that spending this much on a tee and not wanting to wear it again bc you washed it
2.0,Nice and big.  Not sure o n value or protection though
2.0,Belts lengths vary. I have ordered 3 medium belts and they are all different lengths by up to 1 1/2 inches.
2.0,A lot larger than expected. Definitely not the same as the Hobo. Missing pockets inside.
2.0,If it's not zipped it's so silky inside it just slides off shoulders
2.0,I bought these for my bridesmaids and you could definitely tell a difference in dye lots between the different sizes ordered in the same color.
2.0,"I bought this thinking it was a dress, I received a long sleeve shirt. Very unhappy with my order due to the fact it’s for my photo session coming up. The shirt itself is nice but not what I wanted."
2.0,"This outfit was so long! I am 5'5 and even when I tried it as a high waist skirt, it was still dragging on the floor. Also the fit was way too tight. The colors were off, I thought it would look like the picture. It's also sheer. It may work if your very tall. Also I would recommend going up a size as I normally am in a size small and this was way too tight for me."
2.0,"Instead of saying ""princess"" and ""dino""  it says ""painess"" and ""dind"".... It fits and its comfy, but I'm not sure why the ""typo"" unless I received a counterfeit one."
2.0,Watch face is too small
2.0,"The ink in these pens is translucent and difficult to read.  I bought them because I had been at a recent event where the host used the brand sold at Total Wine (I don't know the brand) and the ink in those pens was thicker and much more opaque.  These do not show up on the glass - especially the two metallic ones - but even the green blue and red are hard to see unless you write on the base and put the glass on a white surface.  In view of the fact my furniture is not white, functionality of these pens is marginal for my use.  Price is comparatively low, but that just means it isn't worth the hassle to return them.  :-["
2.0,"Nicely stitched and good quality material.<br />Glove fit fine for all fingers, just not for the thumb. The thumb ratio is off, and there is an excess of about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch.<br />I had 4 other people try them on, with the same excess on the thumb.<br />The touchscreen is a nice touch, IF the glove were to fit perfectly."
2.0,i like it don't get me wrong but i was expecting the same beads as the picture. i got a rainbow bead on mine and the pic doesn’t have it and i was expecting the purple bear and it wasn't on there :/
2.0,I did not like the way it wrapped in me. It did not cover the bottom of the stomach and it moves on you as well.
2.0,"Shipping was good for being a customized order. The lace pattern is not the same as pictured. The custom measurements were right, but it looks really bulky around the stomach area."
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress, but it ran very small and wasn’t well made. I ended up returning it."
2.0,"They are cute looking enough, just too small, and really stiff, which doesn't allow them to stay on my daughter's feet. Even with the velcro closed as tightly as I could get it, they sit awkwardly on her feet (which are neither skinny or chubby) and fall off with her first couple of kicks or moves. Basically useless, as I am sure one or both would be lost on any trip outside of our house, and my baby doesn't hold her feet perfectly still. There's no stretch, and they seem to be made for a doll, not a moving human being."
2.0,It keeps warm really well but it slide down. prefer for sleeping not for daily activity.
2.0,"Too small, snug. I wanted to love it’s soft feeling, but even the Large sized one cannot fit."
2.0,"Wonderful light weight shirt. Ordered an XL which should fit nicely; but, surprise! The tag says XL but the shirt fits like an XS."
2.0,"This is a beautiful soft purse with lots of pockets, which I love. The major problem is that it is so deep but with a very narrow opening so that it will not open enough to see down into the purse.  But even worse is the complicated contraption of the handle.  I never could figure out how to arrange the hooks and straps so that it could be used as a simple shoulder strap. Had to return."
2.0,The toe box is narrow and pretty tight.  Top strap sat too high above the foot.
2.0,Definitely order at least one to two sizes up from what you normally wear.
2.0,"Had to return this. Wanted to love it but the fit was all wrong. This was just too small, even though I bought my size. The elastic around the waist was so tight I don’t think sizing up would solve."
2.0,"I purchased a full size up to make room for wool socks...that seemed to work fine as I has plenty of room. But, I did not like the quality of this boot compared to another old model of similar TNF winter boot...Seemed like the boots were WalMart quality with TNF branding. Probably won't keep you warm and likely not worth the money, despite the other good reviews...so decided to return and purchase a better boot."
2.0,had an ugly gold plated zipper on back of boot
2.0,"SHAME ON YOU JACLLIX! I like the dress, but the quality seems a little weak.  It doesn't fit in the bust, misshaped cups in the bodice..  Would like to return for another dress, but they DO NOT PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING and the cost from Texas to China is $290+.  Too bad, we have a wedding party looking for many dresses.  It's a tough lesson learned.  Will not be buying from Jacllix and will tell everyone I know to not order from them as well."
2.0,The neck doesn't lay down. Looks very awkward. Do not recommend. It looks like a t-shirt neck when you've washed it too many times and it's just worn out.
2.0,tear drop jewel fell off and the balls on the end kept falling off.  Never had this issue before.
2.0,These ear rings are really cute but arrived with one of the clasps broken. I can't even wear them.
2.0,Bought these as a gift for my daughter. Disappointed in size and quality. Chain and pendant all look very cheap.
2.0,Straps are way too long and I didn’t recieve a stick with the mustache it was just wadded into the package without any adhesive or the stick in the deduction.
2.0,"The material is thick, not light. It has a heavy cloth feel and it is very stretchy that turns into bagginess and out-stretched. I wore and washed once and it's just not comfy for summer. I could go a size down."
2.0,The only complaint is that the zipper is way too short. I have a very difficult time getting it on and off.
2.0,Not that great. color is weird. They're to fat and clunky looking. Hard to match with outfits. Not very impressed.
2.0,I bought the set of 3. I was excited after I wore the red pair. The fit was great! They would show a darker underwear underneath but that’s fixable. The black pair kept rolling up to my knees and drove me crazy. The gray pair is super tight all over.
2.0,"5’10” women @ 160lbs. The fabric was very soft, but was 3” above the floor when worn barefoot (size L). I was anticipating a floor length dress, as pictured."
2.0,Chin on mash sit on my chest makes face look extra long.
2.0,"Looked great the first two times I wore it! Then, small stones fell out and it looked like cheap costume jewelry and I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing it.  Such a shame because it was well made other than that. No, tarnishing or discoloring."
2.0,"Tie strings are way, way to short"
2.0,"I bought 3 of these shirts--I like the fit and the fabric. (I bought it in medium.  I have small shoulders and a 36-inch bust.) Wish it were offered  in more colors than just black, white, and yellow. I only bought black. Price was very reasonable.<br />On the down side,  not very well-made.  I found  tiny rips (about 1/4 an inch long) in the shoulder seams on 2 of the shirts,  that I must have missed when I took it out of the package. The third shirt had an unraveled seam in the front (twist) part. I should have examined the products more closely before wearing them. Not able to return them."
2.0,"I ended up ordering three of these in total due to incorrect sizing. I wear a size 5, and although that was what was sent, it was huge. Since I loved the ring, I decided to try again... and yet again. Same result: a “size 5” is not 5, but 5 3/4. Unacceptable, as that is a huge difference."
2.0,Washed these once.  Already the decals are coming off the back and the logo has some strange dots of purple stain that wasn't there before.  Would not buy again.
2.0,"darling on, terrible quality.  lens popped out the first time i wore them. found a better pair and letting my vanity go"
2.0,Didn’t fit had to send back
2.0,These are really heavy and difficult for small kids to use. I bought them because they were the cheapest and my kid kept insisting. It served it's purpose I guess.
2.0,"Its rough, but cheap and serves a purpose for personal use. I am disappointed in the quality control as my ring sizer is missing size 6, it came with two size 6.5 rings and two size 2.5 rings. I can remove the extra rings. But having a missing size 6 is awful since it is a common whole size and it would be nice to know if that size would work or not. I didn't look carefully enough when it arrived to be sure every size was there as I bought it to size my son for a class ring and he needed larger sizes that were all there. His ring fits perfect, so it was worth the price. If we had went with the paper ring sizer it would have been a less than perfect size as we first decided on a different size. These rings are comfortable to try on and smooth like a good ring. It would've been a happy purchase if all the rings were present. I paid extra to get the ring sizer and that makes this purchase a little disappointing. It has sharp edges and labeled a little off.  It works well enough to size your rings to a half size, which can be very helpful if you do have a ring that you love how it fits."
2.0,Super cute choker until I went to wear it. Broke within the first few hours and I don't have a large neck or anything.
2.0,"I am disappointed with these gloves. They fit excellent, but the problem is they do not keep your hands warm to minus 30 degrees as advertised. The outside temperature was plus 15 degrees Fahrenheit and i only lasted 20 minutes, my hands were very cold and I had to stop shoveling snow and go in the house to get something else to warm up my hands."
2.0,My husband didn't read the description carefully. This is a CHILD'S tie and pocket square. Don't make the same mistake. And by child I mean toddler. This wont fit anyone over the age of 5. Cute and good quality though!
2.0,Odd smell and didn’t lay right on me
2.0,Way too skimpy and flimzie for me
2.0,"These shoes are adorable and fit my daughter so well,  but the quality is pretty poor. The toes are already getting holes in them and we have only had them for a couple weeks."
2.0,"nice dress and pretty, but run small!!"
2.0,It was very very small I think it was marked wrong!
2.0,"Polarized sunglasses are a must, otherwise your wasting your money.  I don't expect these to last long as they don't seem very durable."
2.0,"These rings were wonderful. Well, one of them. I was really disappointed that one barely stayed open, and another had to be cut off of me because it was so tightly closed. I had high hopes. At least I got one good one out of it."
2.0,The Fit is extremely clingy. I am not sure if the armpits will fit properly if you go up a size.
2.0,"Super thin, you can’t really put anything on it"
2.0,Of all my leather earrings these are probably my least favorite as far as quality.  I'd say they are just ok.
2.0,Not quality for the price could have paid $5 for this set.
2.0,"I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER OF THESE EXACT SAME BRA'S IN 38DDD THAT I PURCHASED ELSEWHERE IN OTHER COLORS AND THESE 38DDD FROM THIS SUPPLIER RUN VERY SMALL. YOU CAN EVEN HOLD THEM UP NEXT TO THE ONES THAT FIT PROPERLY AND SEE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN SIZE, UNDERWIRE, CUP AND CIRCUMFERENCE; EVEN THOUGH THE BRA'S SAY 38DDD ON THEM AND ALL TAGS???  MAKES ME WONDER IF THEY'RE TRULY A BALI BRA BECAUSE I'VE WORN THIS STYLE/BRAND/SIZE FOR YEARS!"
2.0,"The product was flimsy and wrinkled, not to mention the fact that I sized down yet it was still wayyy too big."
2.0,"I was surprised by how small this is. I searched ""pendant"" and this came up, however, it's teeny tiny."
2.0,Not gold. More of a brass.
2.0,Cheap very lightweight the plastic to cover the photos is very cheap  Not a nice item to be used as a keepsake
2.0,"Material was soft enough, but the fit was more bell-bottom than bootcut."
2.0,"I realize it's a cheap watch and I didn't expect much.  But if Amazon claims it has a light, it should have a functioning light.<br />And from perusing comments, I see dozens of others have discovered this same defect.  I understand this is an old, classic Casio design that once worked well.  My guess is the original design, likely made in Japan, was turned over to a Chinese manufacturer; so the watch looks identical to the original but does not have the same quality.  Time will tell if it lasts."
2.0,Too small for my head.  But nice
2.0,"I ordered 4, since I loved the colors . They arrived very very late and 2 of the 4 are full of small holes, can’t wear them 😏."
2.0,It was very late when it came and bulky. The baby has tough time wearing it and sitting in the car seat. Its very bulky and uncomfortable that she cried until we remove her from this. The button also came off so quickly that i am not sure it's appropriate for 7 month baby who can pull the buttons and put in her mouth
2.0,Nice colors and combination.
2.0,"The chain is short, the blue paint on it is partially chipped all the way around, plasticky, and overall it looks very cheap. The only redeeming quality is that the floral part is pretty."
2.0,"I ordered this in two different colors, and they're very different.<br /><br />The Blue one is great!! I ordered a size up and its super cute and comfy, good material. Soft, flowy, great color as its sort of a soft gray/blue.<br /><br />The red one is awful! 1 Star! I don't recommend it! It is that stiff, weird, itchy material and it runs super small. Kinda feels like a burlap sack. Not flowy, not flattering, not wearable, don't bother."
2.0,Very inconsistent sizing (ordered two different sizes) and the items smelled strongly of patchouli oil.
2.0,I put this on and the slip underneath is way too small I had to go and get a white slip for it and even then I didn't feel like I could wear it outside.
2.0,Bad material! Very cheep!
2.0,After 1 month the nose bads start to falldown until i lost it in the end and the ear bads comes off to
2.0,One size doesn't fit all lol I wear a D cup and normally am a medium or large in shirts and this suffocates my boobs and I hate the material otherwise its so cute just not for me
2.0,I like the quality of the item however when the card is inserted it doesnt allow the card to work on the car and then it's locked in the pouch with a screw so the card is not accessable.
2.0,The band was wider than expected. Worst thing was the clasp. It was extremely sharp. I couldn't wear it for more than 5 min because it was tearing up my wrist.
2.0,Very cheap looking and doesn’t look like real silver.  No silver stamps.
2.0,Material seems very cheap and thin
2.0,It’s smaller then I expected.
2.0,I need to be able to read the time and stop watch on a ski mountain at night. The back light on this watch is so feeble I could barely read it in my closet with the lights off. And it only stays on for three seconds. If I’m taking a pulse on the mountain I need at least fifteen seconds. Although this watch has some nice features it’s useless to me if I can’t use it at night.
2.0,Wasn't satisfied with the dress. The pleating was off on the dress making the dress not fit in the correct spot.
2.0,"These pants are of very good weight and quality yet the fit is poor.  The rise is very long (I can bring them to my waistline and the rise is still long) and the length rested above my ankle.  If I were 3-4 in. shorter (I'm 5.5"" - size O or xs) and had an unusually long waist, these would be great.  The sizing waist wise was good otherwise."
2.0,"These undies were great when I first put them on, super soft and comfy. They fit well and I thought they were going to work me. Unfortunately as the day wore on they began to stretch out and the wedgie just kept getting worse. I’ll keep looking for the perfect pair that don’t ride up."
2.0,"Bought these to match a specific workout top and while the color is nice, the fit and material aren't particularly flattering, and what's worse is they show every drop of sweat... even in the knees (yeah, who knew knees sweat?!) but the crotch area was particularly mortifying. These might be fine for yoga but wouldn't recommend for anything more sweaty or strenuous than that."
2.0,"Thin material doesn't protect from heat as a fiber glass tig finger would... This is obviously a cheap knock off. Works for welding certain things, but not all."
2.0,Very pretty but starts to rust
2.0,"This band is made from bent sheet metal links, not solid links like those usually found on bands in this price range. Bent sheet metal bands are quite commonly found in the $3 to $5 range."
2.0,"The products are cute but the quality is lacking.  Two of the three items were broken within 48 hours.  The seller was great about replacing the broken item and we were able to reconnect loose jewelry links on the bracelet.  If you are looking for something that's going to last awhile, I don't think this is the right product for you."
2.0,"These tops run very small !!!!!!!! I ordered a large and then a 2xl, and they are the same size !!!!!!!!!!"
2.0,Not comfortable as wished!
2.0,"I was hoping for a lapel styled duster, or long cardigan, but this came off more like a robe. There were belt loops and matching fabric belt."
2.0,For the price you pay the product should at least be the size ordered.  Runs about 2/3 the size advertised.
2.0,"I ordered the 3xl size, as this is what I usually wear. There was not a prayer of a chance I was going to be able to get it on. I had various other family members try it, but none could fit it until I had my son, who’s normally between a L and an XL, try it. It was quite a snug fit, so he’ll be using it as an undershirt."
2.0,"While it does help lower my bra in the back, it really cuts into my skin and hurts after wearing for about an hour.  Might be better to just purchase a low back bustier."
2.0,"The material is stretchy and soft to the touch, but this top has inner stitching/lining that feels unfinished and rubs against your skin. The pockets are located in a weird spot and they are also bare stitched with no inner lining. Very uncomfortable, poorly made. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I ordered an XL, can usually wear a L.  I am 5'3"" 160 lbs.  Average build.  Otherwise a nice looking shirt that appeared well-made."
2.0,Quality was poor when compared to other brands purchased at the same price. Was not given value for money
2.0,"The jacket was a little too small but workable.  The pants however were over a foot too long and the waist was fine, but the thigh and hip area is designed for someone with super skinny legs.  Not what you would expect for the size.  I liked the look and lights on it and really was hoping it would have worked.  The return was received back to the seller today, we will see how long it takes for them to process the refund...."
2.0,Lovely dress but had to return too small.
2.0,I loved these glasses but I’ve only had 3 months and the rubber on the ears is peeling on them so I can’t wear them anymore ! Disappointed!!!! They are super cute and comfy to wear until now !
2.0,Feels very cheap and the seam very noticeable.
2.0,"Great idea, but not that great of a quality... I bought the headrest right before the trip with a red-eye flight on the way back. Inflated it on the way there and it was very comfortable. I was impressed! However, on the way back, when I needed it the most, one side started leaking air and deflated. I tried inflating it couple times, but it would not hold at all. It was so disapointing. Returned to amazon for refund. I might give it another try next time I travel as I liked the comfort and it is possible I just got a bad one... But be warned."
2.0,"Junk.<br />I wore these twice and the stitches came out.<br />I don't wear sandals for long periods of time, nor am I hard on my sandals.<br /><br />The stitching on the right flip-flop came apart while shopping and rubbed my foot raw.<br />While taking these photos, I noticed the stitching was already coming apart on the left flip-flop.<br /><br />The material on the straps is nice and soft, but the thong piece is hard and inflexible.<br /><br />As I said, I don't wear sandals for more than a few hours at a time, and have lots of sandals, so I wear different colors depending on my outfit. So I wore these once last year, and once this year, and they're now trash.<br /><br />I'm pretty crafty, but I don't know what I can to make these wearable--and I alter shoes and sandals a lot to be comfortable--so I'm pretty bummed.<br /><br />I wish I'd gotten a style I usually wear, and painted them with leather paint instead of wasting my money on these.<br /><br />I do not recommend."
2.0,"Not durable, Broke easily and disappointed"
2.0,"I really don't like skinny-jeans and hate the fact that so many pants are in this style now. I'm 5'10"" and 165lbs (lean build) and usually wear size 30X32. While the waist on these is fine, it's the legs that are overly tight and restrictive. I shouldn't have to invert pants in order to get them off, but I have to do it with these because of how tight they are on the legs. While I like the color (sort of a faded black), I don't like feeling like I'm wearing spandex pants. Moreover, because of how tight they are, the pockets are effectively useless."
2.0,"Dress looked professional and clean in the images, but was a great disappointment with the way it looked the minute it was tried it on. Style was best summarized as &#34;Disney princess does accounting.&#34;<br /><br />I was also disappointed by how cheap the fabric and accessory belt felt.<br /><br />I ordered a large expecting the dress to be a snug fit based on my measurements and the sizing chart, but found the dress to be baggy in numerous, unflattering areas."
2.0,"This top runs small, especially through the bust.  It’s also too long for me."
2.0,I liked the look and comfort of the sandal but my foot wasn't very stable in the bed so as a result I had to walk very slow in order not to trip especially since they are a wedge. Was only able to wear them once since I didn't want to risk a fall. I'm not sure if it was design or because ran large. This is definitely a order two sizes and return one kind of shoe.
2.0,Too small!!!!!!
2.0,They are not colorful like the earrings in the picture.
2.0,"Loved the style but didn't see small pon-poms attached around arms, made dress look very weird and generic. Pic so small didn't know they they were there til I got it."
2.0,The rhinestone earrings are very loose and very cheaply made and most definitely would not gift this and I won't wear half the earrings. The small silver and gold solid balls are however super cute and wearable
2.0,Six weeks after I got this watchband the leather began to separate. I was very happy until today when I notice it was coming apart. Not good.
2.0,"Product description states that these are for Men’s size 5-9. This is not true.  My feet are a Men’s 7.  These socks are much larger, more likely suited to size 10-13.  I bought multiple designs and this is the case with all of them. Since they are not tube socks, but have a turned heal, these are useless for us — we both wear the same size shoe/sock."
2.0,"I got these and initially LOVED them but had to return them. This was because I had only worn them once, and on the second wear I sat down (kind of criss-cross applesauce style) and the seams in the crotch completely busted. I feel like yoga pants should be able to handle that."
2.0,"Love the material and the feel, but it's much shorter than pictured. It falls to my pants waist, just below the belly button. If the straps were slightly longer, it would be perfect. It just doesn't look right.<br />Size down, it's super flowy and looks like a maternity shirt. I am 36DD."
2.0,"These pajamas were made for people with no figure. If you’re a toothpick with no boobs or butt, they’ll fit great. I even ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it’s still too small.  The description says the set comes with pants, these things are capri length at best - NOT pants.  I’m only 5’2” so they’re not short because I’m soooo tall.  The cami top has no tailoring for boobs. If I had a flat chest it would be no issue, but god gifted me with something more than fried eggs for boobs. All in all, I wouldn’t recommend these pajamas for anyone looking for comfort."
2.0,The neck comes very big.
2.0,"This is a nice looking belt, but not without it's faults. I wanted something that looked good, didn't loosen over time and held it's quality in the long run.<br /><br />Looks: It's a very nice looking belt, with heavy duty nylon mixed with the metal belt buckle. It definitely has that military look and feel.<br /><br />Function: This is where I had some issues. I noticed the belt would loosen a bit after around 2-3 days of use. I would have to adjust it more tighter at roughly a half an inch adjustment. My other issue was that the quick release buckle would occur while bending/crouching. Apparently my stomach and pelvic area would pinch both top and loosens the buckle. This has happened at least 3 times after just two months of owning it. Luckily, I was wearing a long enough shirt for it not to noticed while in public. Being that this is a tactical belt, you would think that there would be a lot of bending/crouching going on.<br /><br />Quality: I'll update this section after about 6 months with the belt, or if something drastically happens in the meantime.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars, mostly because the main function of the belt had the two issues (not holding its position long enough/buckle undoing itself). The price is great, but where do you draw the line of price over quality?"
2.0,The print was very nice but it was way too small and the fabric is cheap.
2.0,"Not crazy about the material, way too clingy for my liking. Although the color and style I love, the fabric just isn't right for my body shape."
2.0,The description said dark green. It is not. This maxi dress is a teal color. Beware!
2.0,I tried them on but they feel and look kind of cheap. On the image the denim seems to have more “structure” but in person it is a thin stretchy material which might be a pro fir some but it is just too much for me:)
2.0,"I gave it two stars because it was actually really cute. However, cute doesn't matter if it doesn't fit on your body. The sizing is not true whatsoever! I ordered up two sizes and still could not get this thing to fit.  Definitely Asian sized.  Thank goodness Amazon is great about refunds!"
2.0,"Cheap, low-quality, thin frames."
2.0,"I was excited to get this cute outfit, but to my surprise I didn’t care for the material and it was cut a tad small. Too form fitting for me. I was looking for a looser fit. So I will be returning."
2.0,I’m 5’3” and the Jeggings was way too long. I was also disappointed in the material as it was not as thick as I had thought.  I ended up returning the item.
2.0,I had a pair about 6 or 7years ago that lasted two years before I had to retire them. This pair only lasted 6 months. Very disappointed with this pair of hikers.
2.0,"I was really bummed about the feel of this earring! It's super cute, the perfect size for my ear, but the post is too long so it spins over my ear and doesn't stay. Also, I tried it out for about 4 days but I couldn't even sleep on my ear because of the pressure the jewelry put on the outter part of my ear. The ball is also extremely hard to thread. If I'm wanting cute jewelry every once in awhile I'll put it in though."
2.0,"This was super cute, I fell in love with it when I bought it. But there is like a film on the watch that peeled off almost right away :(<br /><br />I had to buy a different one. I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for something long term."
2.0,"These socks DO NOT stay on, despite the rubber heel grip.  They slide off all the time.  Awful and annoying."
2.0,Not at all soothing or soft fabric. Too large in fitting.
2.0,"Very stylish, but I dont think these are 1.5 readers, I cant see a thing with them on."
2.0,I thought this was going to be a tan and dark brown pug. It's pink. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Poorly made. Color faded quickly off eyebrow rings. Two, I could not wear because I could not get the balls to come loose."
2.0,The size is right but it's a struggle getting them on. The uppers are not elasticized and there's no stretch in the material. I kept them anyway - I can use the exercise. R&D department should be fired - if there is one.
2.0,"I have a tall 4 year old. 4T or 5T fits her well depending on the cut. The 5T went down to her knees and the sleeves were like parachutes! I’d say it fit probably 2-3 sizes too big.<br />The material reminds me of those silly pajamas.<br /><br />She loves the print, so I am keeping it and adding it to her dress up clothes.<br /><br />The picture is of a size 5t tshirt from old navy on top of this alleged size 5t bluey shirt."
2.0,is the second watch from this type i bought and is going to be the last.  i do not recommend anyone to buy this.
2.0,The hat and belt were way too small. I had to add felt to the hat to fit right and the belt was way to small for the size of the costume.
2.0,Missing parts.
2.0,"I regret paying so much for these. ☹️I don’t normally pay this much for shoes but was looking for some pretty dressy sandals and took my chances. These are not comfortable well atleast for me they weren’t I am a flatfoot and my feet are pretty wide. Also the way the show is made underneath, makes it feel like your going to break your ankle in them. 😭 hoping this doesn’t happen to me 😩"
2.0,"super comfy fabric, feels like butter. they fit perfectly for just hanging out but they fall down all the time. as a runner, i wore these once and had to hike up pants at least 10 times..soooo annoying. i don't know if you should size down because they fit fine, just slippery"
2.0,"The color is way off from the picture. I got the brown option, and the back is army green...?? Note i just tried to order the black, and it's suddenly not available for Prime, when it was two days ago. Be careful with the colors. Noir happy."
2.0,"Returned it.  Fabric is very thick, the cut is not like the photo."
2.0,Low quality. Button fell off quickly
2.0,very poor quality<br />breaks easily
2.0,"This comes with 12 sets of bracelets and of the two sets I've opened so far, both were missing beads. It comes with two types of silver spacer beads.  It's supposed to have 12 of each type but the first one I opened only had 8 or 9.  I had to open up another set to finish the first bracelet, and since that set was also already short on the same beads, that one will need even more beads from another set to finish. By the time I'm finished I will probably only have about 8 bracelets.  It does come with a small bag of extra beads but it's only enough to make up for the missing beads in one bracelet!  Also beware that the bracelets are a bit small. I have a normal sized wrists and it fits tightly on me.  I'd prefer it a little looser but can't make it bigger because there aren't enough beads.<br />One positive:  the beads are very pretty and makes a nice looking bracelet."
2.0,"The size chart is completely off. By their listing I should be a size medium - (I’m typically a size 10, 38C.) I’m about 5 inches away from being able to button this dress at the bust. Fits fine below that. It is very cute and I like the material, but it’s going back."
2.0,"Cute dress but order a size up, return policy says I had until 9/20/2019 to return item, but window closed on 9/19/19 very unhappy with this purchase experience."
2.0,Puffball literally fell off the oatmeal colored hat within 5 minutes of wearing it. Not stoked at all.
2.0,the belt buckle fell apart the second time i wore the belt.
2.0,"This is a nice item, but it runs at least 4 sizes smaller than American sizes.  Even when using the measurements box, it was much too small.  Needed a lot more room in the bust.  The description did not mention beads.  The ivory was much lighter than expected.  Overall the jacket looks very nice and is well constructed.  Not a good purchase for me because my dress doesn't have beads, so I didn't want them; and the ivory of my dress and the ivory jacket were very different."
2.0,Very big. The chain was broken in the package.
2.0,"Very cute locket, great for my five year old daughter. However I opened the necklace to put it on her, tried to undo the clasp and it snapped. Totally broken. It came with two chains, but the chain that the locker comes in would have to be severed in order to put the locket on the other chain. Flawed design for sure. I have a replacement coming, hoping it’s better for my daughters’ sake, but not high hopes."
2.0,Cute but broke on the first day it was worn.
2.0,"The sizing on this is SO off. According to the size chart, I should be a size 10. I ending up buying a size 8 since the reviews said the dress runs large. When I tried it on, it was WAY too large. I needed the dress last minute for a wedding I was going to be in. I ended up having to frantically return be dress and do one day shipping and cross my fingers that the size 4 would fit. The size 4 fit perfectly except for the chest area. It was extremely awkward. I ended up keeping the top unbuttoned and wore the dress sleeves hanging off my shoulder (see picture for reference). I loved how that looked, but that’s not how the dress was made to look. The material is quite stretchy."
2.0,The dress is pretty but it was too big :(
2.0,"I LOVE the feel of these…. SO soft and comfy, yet I wanted something to workout in, and these are high waisted! 😭 I hate high waisted, so that is my major let down and disappointment…. Nowhere does it say high waisted… even the girl in the pics is wearing them on her hips.<br />If I pull them down, then they give the baggy crotch look.<br />I’ll keep them for around the house, but still let down."
2.0,"What ever size you think you should buy add two sizes,"
2.0,already falling apart after a few months
2.0,Was not the length pictured. White cheap beads and not the pretty pearl color. Definitely nothing like the picture.
2.0,The sizing runs very small
2.0,"These look so cute, male or female. My thing with them was that the some pair's almost seem Mis-matched. The pin that goes thru the ear was on different parts, 1 would be on the front, decorative piece and another in the back plate, just annoying. Then the wood part just drops off and you are left with a plain plate."
2.0,I ordered a size 6/7 for my 5 year old. The dress came it’s a cute dress… nice quality for the price but it’s extremely small. As soon a I opened the pack I just started shaking my head. It’s a good dress for babies to small toddlers. The “6/7” size would fit a 2/3 year old. The sizes are way off ! Gave 2 stars only because it’s a cute dress for the price.
2.0,I disliked that size wasn't true to the fit.
2.0,It broke the first time I wore it. 😐
2.0,"I bought a set in July of 2016, they started falling apart and I replaced them in December 2016. I had worn a hole in that set by April 2017. These don't hold up as well as the insoles that came in the boots or the better insoles I have purchased from the local red wing store. It is recommended to replace them every 6 months but these insoles don't give you a choice."
2.0,"Not &#34;bad&#34; quality, but you are getting what you pay for. The lenses of the glasses are faded from top to buttom, the glasses look like they are molded each specific color and then spray painted black. Haven't used them long because I bought a few other pairs of different brands so can't speak about quality. Just know, you GET what you pay for..."
2.0,La tela muy gruesa y no era el azul que se ve
2.0,"The side seams are not symmetrical, and the side seam along the hip on the right side is a bit crooked. It causes the dress to wrinkle and bunch on that side. Also, it fits very poorly and the material looks and feels cheap. I'm petite and typically wear a size 6 or smaller. I ordered the large based on the size recommendations. It's too large in some areas (e.g. the waist), but seems a bit snug through the hips. I'm curvy, but I have a good figure. Fitting snugly is usually not an issue, but when it's also baggy through the waist, it looks really weird. The real issue here is low quality material and shoddy workmanship. The dress doesn't even have any tags indicating the type of material, location of manufacture, or who the manufacturer/brand might be. I am very disappointed, as some of the reviews are very positive, and I was looking forward to wearing the dress. It's very cute in the pictures. $25 sounded like a good deal, but the reality is, after trying it on and seeing how it feels and looks, I wouldn't be surprised to see it on a bargain rack for $5 (at which point I still wouldn't buy it)."
2.0,"When I was first trying on this, I was super excited.<br /><br />The fit along the butt, and the slimming effect along the stomach was encouraging, until it was actually on.<br /><br />The little &#34;sticky strip&#34; along the top of the shapers does not hold the material up, and it doesn't come up high enough to tuck into the bra. Add to this, the fact that the material rolls down every time you move, it renders the panties unusable.<br /><br />I liked the feel of the material, and loved that they were nude, but overall, it left a lot to be desired. I don't recommend these at all.<br /><br />I have used many different shapewears, and wear one almost daily. I will not be keeping these and will throw them away.<br /><br />I was given a promotional price for these in exchange for an honest review."
2.0,I didn't get two of each dinosaur ):
2.0,"No support. Basically feels like a leather covered flip-flop. If you require any kind of support for your foot, Don't Buy this pair. Look for something else."
2.0,Necklace turned my neck green after wearing and silver wore off to a brownish green color after wearing 3 times...
2.0,Watch broke after wearing for about a month!
2.0,"Cheap materials, hard to size because the material is so stiff."
2.0,The bracelet was not soldered properly at the end of the link. It is a poor imitation.
2.0,Not what I was expecting — very tight for credit cards. Disappointed. Would not recommend
2.0,The band was great & so much easier for a child to use compared to the band that came with the Fitbit.<br /><br />The problem is the magnet touched the magnet on the back of the Fitbit & the Fitbit no longer works. That’s a pretty big deal for me & the reason for 2 stars.
2.0,"If you have medium/large bust, do not even think about ordering this. Fits decently in the body but absolutely won’t work if your breasts are even higher end medium or large."
2.0,"I didn’t realize that the darn things have to be put together and with these incredibly small screws. I am 59 years old, I wear bifocals with astigmatism, and I have arthritis in my hands!  How easy is it for me to put them together before I can; no, (in order to be able to), wear them? I wouldn’t have given them 1 star but I like how pretty they are."
2.0,"Bag not what i expected, sorry I did not read the reviews before I ordered. The material feels cheap and the inside is distasteful without pockets."
2.0,I love the color purple.  At the time I purchased these purple masks the picture shown was the entire mask as purple.  No white trim at top and bottom of mask.  That's  why I purchased these dark purple masks because the entire mask was suppose to be purple.  What I received was  dark purple masks with white trim at the top of mask and white & grey trim at the bottom of mask.  See my picture provided. I already have the purple masks with the white trim.  I purchased those from another seller for three dollars cheaper.  This is so disappointing.  For those of you who think this is no big deal....then why offer different colors?  Just a heads up for those that like the color purple.  P.S.  Masks pass the candle flame test.
2.0,"The Size i order I did not get, i order small and got large....."
2.0,These are super soft comfy but they are huge! I am not a small person and they don’t fit my face as snug as they should. My teenager is going to end up using them as headbands.
2.0,Did not realize flag is one sided. Seems silly to have it read backwards from one side.
2.0,I bought size m but it's too small
2.0,"Cute cute cute, but sending back. I ordered according to measurements to chart best I could figure to no avail! Couldn’t even get it on. It literally was the size of a child’s shirt!"
2.0,"These pants run way too small, and they are made cheaply. The waist band doesn’t feel like it will hold up through a full wear, so I have yet to, and likely will not, wear them. Wasted my money on a gamble, and lost."
2.0,"Chain looks nice, but is TOO short, not the length stated on product page. I am trying to return it for a credit but it says no refund. That was Not stated in the description! I have contacted Amazon 2 times but have not received any help. I am Not happy."
2.0,not royal blue at all. dark navy at best. very tight along the arms. not warm enough
2.0,The print on shirt looks cheap
2.0,"I was expecting a sweatpant/sweatshirt like material - these are much thinner and shinier than I expected. The pattern is cute, but the waist and cuffs are not ribbed as they appeared to be. Cute pattern, not great fabric."
2.0,It was much smaller than expected.  It’s a firm stretch fabric.  A large was ordered but seemed more medium to small.  I’ll have to give this to my daughter.
2.0,These were definitely true to size!
2.0,Disappointed with fit
2.0,"They are cute, however they are too big they fall off your face. Not tight enough."
2.0,"The dress itself is very cute. However, it came with two holes in it... one by the zipper on the side and one in the armpit seam. The fabric of the skirt is decent, but the fabric of the top is rather thin. I’m going to try to sew the holes and see if I can get a few wears out of it, but in all honesty... I wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,I ordered this shirt one size bigger and it was still to small
2.0,Looks really cool is a bit big and will turn your finger green.
2.0,"The minute I took this out of the package and felt the material, I knew I would be returning it. It feels annoying against my skin, like nails on a chalk board.<br /><br />It's also much lower in the front than expected. Pretty much everything about this shirt makes me uncomfortable."
2.0,"I ended up having to return these because they were so small. They seem like they would be decent, although I'm not sure how natural they would look. I really can't say because I didn't really get to try them out. Also, compared to other similar items, it seems like there are better quality items for the same or similar price. I'm giving them two stars because the fabric was super scratchy, they were incredibly small, (I'm a 6-8), and the panty line was super uncomfortable, and because of how noticeable the panty line was."
2.0,"More yellow than blue, so not quite as pictured. Also, fabric was very cheap feeling, not silk-like at all. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is that it's a good size. I am returning it though."
2.0,Nice leggings just sized for a child.
2.0,Loose fitting comes out easily
2.0,This did not fit well. It was big under the arms and was not flattering to my figure. It was also poorly made. I sent it back.
2.0,Chain gets tangled easily.  Not as long as in photo.
2.0,The most I'll fitting bathing suit I've ordered. The top is too small with no support and the bottom is too big. I wouldn't be surprised if I weren't built like a coke bottle but I have plenty of butt to keep these bottoms up. Save your money! Trust me!
2.0,runs small and much shorter than the photo
2.0,"I love this in the picture, but I don't know if it's because the way It was packaged, in a bag and then jammed into my mailbox...it's not anywhere near as pretty as the picture.  I had to return it.  Even for the cheap price, I was very surprised at the poor quality."
2.0,Cute but entirely too big to be worn as earrings!!
2.0,Very cute shoe but NOT comfortable at all.
2.0,I just received my item and it has a Defaut!
2.0,Poor fabric quality.
2.0,It’s too big if you don’t have hair
2.0,Very small and not great quality. For the price should come with a chain. Returned.
2.0,Pretty but bad quality.
2.0,"Ordered an XL, it was too small, and the material is too thin. The v-neck is also weirdly shaped."
2.0,Cute belt but ran very small.
2.0,"Even before washing, these are no where near a size 12. After washing they shrink a LOT in length, leaving my child with a camel —-. I bought a size 12 for a 10 year old who is very very skinny. These do not even fit my 8 year old, she is 53 inches tall and 65 pounds, for reference, and a size 12 is too small after washing. These are about right for a 6 year old. If you are shopping for a 6 year old, I’d buy size 12 and wash and dry them, and then they might fit. They are very soft and lovely panties but do not fit anywhere near what they say, and they will continue to shrink with each washing. The picture shows a washed (warm water) and dried (low temp) pair, over a new out of the package pair."
2.0,"Bought these to add to the drawstring on some sweatpants, but they are not strong enough to keep the string from sliding through and the sweats slipping down. Might be good for another project that doesn't need to be so securely fastened."
2.0,These look cute on the model but would maybe be a better late night walking my dogs in the dark pants. I discarded packaging befor I was able to return.
2.0,"This is a really cute mask. A lot of reviews said it was big, so I thought I’d be good for my 8 and 10 year old. It is so tiny they can’t even get it to stretch anywhere near their ears 😕 The earloops are fabric and not stretchy so if it doesn’t fit, you’re stuck with it 😣"
2.0,La talla es muy grande compre una L y es súper grande
2.0,"I'm so disappointed in the bra, it is way too small. I'm usually between a 36 and 38, but went ahead and ordered the larger size, since items from china tent to run a bit snug. The cups are not made to hold a C cup and the straps are not adjustable, since I do have a longer torso, the straps are digging in and the bra is not where it is supposed to be. I had to return it."
2.0,"This gaiter covers the neck and back and protects from sun for people with hives from sun/heat/humidity. The issue is that small/medium does not fit my neck and it puts pressure on my skin. If there was a true medium size, it might fit better. I bought large and it is too loose on my neck and looks unfortunate. It still protects but it is a poor sizing choice."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:2ba8bd519b558d6c14fa556550a3d0d5]] No es lo que esperé que fuera, es muy engomado para mi experiencia, se enrolla en la parte de atrás y cuando me la quiero poner al siguiente día queda con pliegues, si ajusta pero si te mueves cambia la forma, no es para una mamá ama de casa, tampoco para cargar cosas, solo para ir una hora al gimnasio o para ponerte una ropa de un momento 2 días perfectos ya los demás me duelen, lo digo porque tengo 2 fajas enteras de alta compresión y la sé llevar todo los días sin problema y no duelen ni molestan son de M&D pero quería saber ni en verdad se quedan los rrollitos porque por esa razón nunca uso corselles pero no, ya este tipo de gomas las he usado y no me impresiona para naa y el jueves hice unos ejercicios y se me corrió ya estaba muy doblada y tengo 2 días que no la uso para que regresen los pliégues y se ponga lisa como cuando llego me la puse temprano y me la retiré como que perdió la esencia del 1er día."
2.0,This mask is super small and is not a great mask for anyone that is an adult male I would think.
2.0,"They appear to be made well and they fit well, but they won't stay on.  The back slips off my heel.  It may just be my feet and how I walk."
2.0,"These run small, my daughter is thin and they were still tight on her. I would recommend going up a size. The material is thin too."
2.0,They were way too small. My Step daughter says they're really comfortable though
2.0,I like the bracelet but it is big on my wrist. Wish you could adjust the size
2.0,Looked like a lovely dress....good quality.  Arrived timely.  It ran small however.  Compared it to a size 6 and it was much narrower and about the same length....so I had to return it.  Great dress...just order larger size
2.0,The print was cheap quality and hard to make out the characters.
2.0,Hand wash or it will shrink. My child got to wear it only one time .
2.0,"I've been buying a lot of built in bra camis this summer.  While I loved the color, this was  my least favorite.  The straps are too stretchy to give any support and the cups are not stitched in, like many others, and seem very small, so I can't get them well positioned.  If I hadn't worn it for a few hours, I would return."
2.0,"Really beautiful prints, but really poor quality."
2.0,I’m just unhappy it broke the first day
2.0,"I normally wear an XL, so ordered the XXL based on reviews. These camis are STILL incredibly small. On the plus side, they are soft and cute! I ended up giving them to my daughter who is a M/L"
2.0,Mine stretched out really easily and would not stop slipping off my finger after that.
2.0,"Cheap, stiff, I'm sure uncomfortable. I bought for a Christopher Robin costume for a boy because I didn't want to spend a fortune on something he'd wear once. No good for more than a costume, and even that will likely give you blisters."
2.0,"Smaller than expected, not sure if it's real sterling"
2.0,"The cut of the tank is disappointing. It’s constantly falling forward and I have to pull the backside. It’s very thin, not very good quality."
2.0,I have been buying these shorts for about 3 years - I have only ordered the beige color on line until now. The dark gray and the olive are definitely about a size smaller than supposed to be. Very disappointed as my husband loves these shorts and i hate sending anything back.
2.0,"I realize this is inexpensive jewelry, but come on...one of the ""stones"" fell off before I got the earrings out of the package.  ""Inexpensive"" should not mean ""trash."""
2.0,Very nice wore out very quickly.
2.0,Very cheaply made and not comfortable.
2.0,It fades to fast
2.0,These are comfy but I washed these one time and the sock is already separating (this is with multiple pairs and not just one). Buyer beware. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"The silver coloring faded 3 days after, and fell apart on me after wearing it for a week. Not that disappointing since I bought it so cheap."
2.0,Very difficult to clasp and almost immediately caused irritation. They do look as pictured and are pretty though! But I will not be able to wear them :(
2.0,The hat was folder and had 4 creases all around that won’t flat with water or anything. I may return.
2.0,makes you look bigger
2.0,"Color good, fit good, but was way thinner than others I’ve ordered..gave away"
2.0,"They didn’t stay closed. I needed to return. Otherwise, I would have loved them."
2.0,"I think these shoes might have been used,1 shoe seemed to be stretched out"
2.0,The part the covers your nipples has to much fabric it feels nice and fits everywhere else but no ones boobs are shaped like that lol
2.0,"The anklet is very cute and looks just like it does in the picture, unfortunately it was too small for my ankle. The chain was long enough for me to just barely attach it, but I'm going to have to buy a chain extender in order for it to fit properly. Other than the tight fit, I'm very happy with it. The dangling balls don't make noise, which I was afraid of.<br /><br />After a few weeks of wearing this anklet off and on, I noticed that it had turned my skin green! I'm so disappointed in this anklet and had to throw it away. I left 2 stars because it is still very cute, but I really wish it had been made of higher quality metals."
2.0,"I love this way this looked, so I decided to give it a try. I was adjusting it to fit on my ear, and it broke. It's very small and does not bend, so don't try. I super glued it back together and wear it in my second hole so it can fit around my ear."
2.0,These mala beads were made loosely and fell apart after a couple of days. Please make them tighter.
2.0,Quality cheap<br />To expense for the quality
2.0,It was too small and fit weird
2.0,It broke within the first 3 days of having and all the liquid drained out.
2.0,I love this pack for the size but the zipper didn't work when I got it and ended up breaking completely after 1 week.  I had to send it back.  You can tell that the zippers used are cheap.  I should have expected as much for the price.  Other than that it would have been a great pack.
2.0,"Meh...they were $10...so I wasn't expecting them to be great.  The cord should be longer...they JUST reach the floor when hooked up to my laptop.  Also - they invite clumsiness...there's no release from the cord to the slipper, so if you forget that you're wearing them and jump up to answer the door...your laptop will crash to the floor.<br /><br />The heat packs slide into the front end of the slipper. The heat packs are wrapped in a thin fabric - and the fabric was torn on one of mine, resulting in one slipper being a lot hotter than the other.<br /><br />Regarding size - I wear a 6.5 US and they just fit.  A larger foot would not be able to accommodate these.<br /><br />So - buy them as a novelty item...not as an investment of something great."
2.0,"I used these masks twice and was perfectly fine, but the third time I was burned super bad and it took 2 weeks to completely heal!"
2.0,The gems fell out within a couple hours of light wear. Looked nice before that.
2.0,"Unless packed to absolute capacity, luggage tipped over.  Expandable feature was useless."
2.0,"The watch look very great but after one month it started getting off, it was constantly behind and I had to put on time everytime"
2.0,"If you have a slender build, without any spare tire, these tanks look great.  They are a bit snug, but a guy with a muscular chest and a flat stomach will like this shirt."
2.0,"these earrings are good for a child, not an adult.  They are small and look cheap.  Not much sparkle to them.  Look like poorly cut glass. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"We could not use these because they hurt both my daughters and pinched their ears. Even on the largest size, they did not work. I suppose they were otherwise as represented as far as what they look like (although not my taste) but they were of no use to us unfortunately."
2.0,Ended up returning it. Lovely color but didn't fit correctly
2.0,Definitely not one size fits all. Way too big for me and I’m an adult with a chunky face. The fact I have to constantly pull it up is annoying.
2.0,The steel was easier to see then the stone.
2.0,"The split is in the middle, not side. I couldn’t wear it"
2.0,"The picture makes it look like it has a button to attach the two sides together at the chest area, but it doesn't so it connects at the bottom where you tie and other than that it is wide open at the top. Definitely need a light tank underneath so you're not exposing yourself! This would work well if you are breastfeeding however because the top is easy to open up (if it had a button). It also fit smaller than what I normally order. Overall, disappointed in this order."
2.0,"Item came on time, size is perfect, but stitching was not good."
2.0,Straps are not adjustable - inside cup stitching unraveling
2.0,Runs small & it’s so light weight u can see through it:(
2.0,"I have a relatively substantial behind for my size and I thought these would be good for showing it off. Unfortunately the design made my butt look flatter and less round/perky than it is. I won't be wearing them and I'm disappointed that I wasted the money. Also, the lace-looking red and black design on the front of mine made them look cheap."
2.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; 130lbs and I ordered the S/M. These yoga pants are practically transparent on me if I bend over even slightly. I am giving them 2 stars because they fit very well and are super comfortable but I can not wear them as &#34;pants&#34; or to work out. I will keep them and wear them as leggings under dresses in the fall.<br />I would recommend the &#34;Danskin Women's Essentials Ankle Legging&#34; for anyone looking for a comfortable, cotton, yoga pant. They are very comfortable and not at all see through. For reference, a Medium in those pants fits me perfectly."
2.0,These are not tight capris. They were like bell bottoms. Not cute at all!
2.0,"I'm 5'9 and I expected this dress to be much longer. It's a pretty dress, just disappointed in the length. It comes down to the middle of my shins."
2.0,the bid is long enought but the fabric is very thin. it did stop food but the drinks bleed thru the bid to the shirt
2.0,"I ordered the name Madelyn, but that is not the name I received. Hazel? Seriously? I followed the ordering instructions, but obviously, it does not matter what name you pick, because they just send whatever name they want! It's a shame too because it could be a cute piece. It has a decent weight to it and the chain has an extender, but I can't speak to the wearability of the piece, because why would I wear it? My name is NOT Hazel!!!!! What's even more annoying is the seller has the nerve to post comments regarding the Vine program and it's reviewers! Hey, here's an idea: stop making excuses and instead of trying to cover up your mistakes, fix them! "
2.0,Cute but looks more black then gray.  Have to shop for actual gray ones now
2.0,The clasps  open on their own a lot. And the finish fades within a few months when worn daily. If you alone wear it for special occasions it is a nice band to have.
2.0,"My son is a size 9, so I purchased these in a 9 for him.  When they arrived, they were way too big.  To the point where he was walking out of them.  So, I purchased another pair, size 8 and those were still very big.  I figured for the price, I’d just hang onto them until he fits in them next summer, but I would not purchase again due to the inaccurate sizing and the hassle"
2.0,The bow tie is not well made. The material feels cheap and the bow had a lot of lose strings hanging from the seems. Would not recommend even for the low price.
2.0,Too tight on top and a little short
2.0,I would have like these earrings to be larger and hang  a little lower.  They are ok for a child. But as an adult I would prefer something more visible.
2.0,The lengthy is bit short
2.0,"I bought this for myself because I liked the photo of the star fish. I wanted the key chain itself and was not really interested in the rest of items.<br />I have to agree with another reviewer that the key chain looks like a dollar store item. While it is pretty, it's very light weight and cheap looking. I would not recommend this as a gift. The packaging is very good, as stated by other reviewers.  You would expect something with that type of packaging to be better quality.<br />If I had seen this in a store I would not have paid so much for it.<br />After receiving this keychain, I bought a much better quality one for $2 at a local store."
2.0,Runs small in my option. I have a long torso so it didn’t come down long enough on me
2.0,The fur comes off on everything and the size is way off. I ordered a XXlarge thinking it would be huge on me and it fit like a normal large sweater. My son who is 12 tried it on and it fit him like a normal hoodie. Really cheaply made!! I can not recommend this to anyone and will be returning it.
2.0,Didn't like it so I sent it back
2.0,"Too thick, it is super stretched out and doesn’t stay put, and the material makes it difficult to breath. I gave it away"
2.0,Color is not what it looks lik in the picture i ordered dark gold. I got orange and black I dnt even see that option on colors. Disappointed!!!
2.0,It was just made with some kind of material I didn't like.
2.0,. . . VERY LITTLE STRETCH.
2.0,Wish I had paid attention and realized that I was paying $14 for a single earring. Very cute but not worth the money for a single one. I have two ears.
2.0,Weird looking!
2.0,"The fabric is a soft cotton blend with a tiny bit of atretch and the fabric pattern is as pictured. But the shape of the dress I got is straight up and down, no flare or swing. The workmanship of the garment is altogether not good."
2.0,I'm sending it back. For 40$ the logo should really look nicer. The logo is small and looks like it will come off.
2.0,"Very thin and stiff, not what I wanted. Shrunk quite a bit in a cold wash and definitely needs ironing after each wash. I’ll keep it for my daughter, but don’t recommend."
2.0,"Not happy.  Once this belt arrived it was quick to see it wasn't a solid leather belt, but instead a thin leather bonded to something stretchy type of deal.  These type of belts never last but I figured it looked nice I'll live with it.  Worn it twice (two whole days) and it's already started to flake (see picture), which is the reason for two stars.  At this price it's an over priced cheap belt not worth the cost.  I wouldn't recommend nor will I purchase from this manufacture again."
2.0,"Returned item, the quality was cheap. I didn’t feel it was worth the money."
2.0,"This top is really cute if you look like the model.  Otherwise, it's going to fit you like a sleep top or undershirt."
2.0,This is cute looking.....breaks easily though. Broke first time I wore it.Where the chain attaches to the antlers' broke. Bleh.
2.0,"The jewel is really big, it didnt look that good"
2.0,"Will Shrink After washing  .  Tried to return it after realizing order wrong size, and without opening the package and seller is charging for the return."
2.0,"These were a disappointment.  They are a bit loose around the mouth of the slipper, but worse - they are not soft under the foot.  I guess they might be good to keep in your guest room - to keep your guests from getting too comfy and overstaying their welcome ;-)"
2.0,Change in one month
2.0,Bought this for my son.....this one ran very small
2.0,"The quality is ok but I have the toe type yoga socks & they're so difficult to put on.  I thought these would b better but they move around too much while doing the poses.  infact, at one point the sticky side was on top of my foot & i had to readjust.  So I have reverted back to the toe type.<br />For me, it was a waste of money."
2.0,"This a beautiful suit. Quality looks good but the sizing is all wrong. I ordered a 7/8 (labels say Large) for my very small 6 1/2 year old who normally would take a XS or size 5/6. I sized up based on reviews. The top is too small!! And the bottoms are too big. We are bummed because the suit is super cute. I don’t recommend ordering it, I don’t see how this sizing would work for any child. :("
2.0,Tried using while on phone and won’t work. Disappointed
2.0,"The picture looks like the legs are straight and slightly fitted. Actually, the legs were very wide and I’ll fitting. Very disappointed. Had to return."
2.0,Nice boot not for me. Did not like the fit. Returning them
2.0,"They work ok, but most of the time the mask comes loose from the clasp."
2.0,useful around the house only
2.0,"The nose piece fell off after a bike ride, wanted Amazon to do a replacement but they couldn't, so it was returned.  Disappointed.<br />Really wanted to give it a try for the cheap price on a &#34;lightning deal&#34;."
2.0,"It doesn't work properly, even if I set it on time it get itself a few minutes behind from actuak time"
2.0,The top is too small to cover boobs... I’m a 34DDD and I ordered a large.... it will be returned asap
2.0,"The fabric feels great. The zipper is easy up and down. That is the only nice honest things to say. I ordered navy ruched. It was a more of a purply blue. Think navy that'd been sunbleached for a while. The seams on the back looked very stressed, like it was too small for me but it was quite the opposite. The fit was fine for my body. The straps weren't the same length. The chest area was stitched oddly. The seams didn't match what an average woman would look like. It's a shame I like the fabric and I needed this for a wedding. I am bummed. Should've read more reviews and trusted them."
2.0,Cute concept. The sleeves are sewn into the body of the shirt. It would be easy to take a seem ripper and detach the sleeves without causing damage to the shirt. This just hangs off my daughter and she hates it. Will be returning.
2.0,"I don't think any of mine even reached the 2"" in length, and they were all weird shapes.  Lots of small holes in the rocks, not totally smooth for painting.  Disappointed."
2.0,"Your choice is one of three color variations: 1- multicolor, slow flash. 2-blue fast flash or 3-blue slow flash. That's it. There is no ability to change or program to a different, solid color of any other kind."
2.0,Ordering a size up was still too small
2.0,"I got this dress in pink and it's too sheer to wear. Also, when I bent down to pick something up, the skirt spread wide open from the middle. You would constantly have to be holding the skirt together, whether you were sitting or walking. It's good for standing still only."
2.0,"For the high price the size is quite small. I read the size and I guess I thought 40L was larger than it actually is. It does pack down, just smaller than a can of soda but ultimately not worth it to me, will be returning."
2.0,"I have a number of ""kid"" goggles  and none are as small as these.  Even my 7yo had trouble seeing out of them due to the small field of view.  Construction seemed ok and they seem to likely deal with fogging ok with both the foam between the face and the goggles and some vents in the frame.  The frame is somewhat flexible but these are one and done style as I don't think you are sourcing replacement lenses when these get scratched up (which all goggles do way too soon).  I would probably pass on these."
2.0,This blouse is too short and too thin! I also don't have the time to wash it by hand as the care instructions suggest.
2.0,Way too small... Meant for like a teenager
2.0,"I ordered this umbrella for one of our outdoor tables. The color is beautiful and the size is great but, the solar lights don't work. It's very disappointing. I purposely bought this for the lights and color."
2.0,"I love the fit on these. They're perfect for us slim guys that don't want to swim in our clothes. Unfortunately, however, the fabric is terrible. It stains easily and realistically has to be ironed every single time you wash it. VERY wrinkly."
2.0,"Can't see where it's doing anything for my pain. Pretty bracelet ( a reason I gave it 2 stars) not the kind I ordinarily wear.  Since I won't wear it, I threw away $40."
2.0,Cons<br />1. They feel like knockoffs (feels cheap)<br />2. The MI blue is a little off  (can't describe this acccurately)<br />2. The material is flimsy<br /><br />Pro<br />1. You will have it and nobody really looks at a LT's shoulder boards
2.0,"Based on the description and comments above. My daughter weighing 135lb and being 5'2 should wear a size small. We received a size small and sent it back. We are waiting on a large now. My son is gifting this to her for christmas. We just had to look at it to know it wouldnt fit her. So far I'm not impressed with the sellers advice and or size history. Clearly there is some funky stuff going on considering there are two size smalls, two size mediums for sale, ext., but we will see how this next order goes. Considering its cosplay it did seem like decent material but you often don't know until it has been washed and I didnt wash the 1st order before it was returned."
2.0,necklace was too heavy .<br />removed some of the links to make this wearable
2.0,"Two stars for the quality of the material, which seemed to be pretty good but....the thick, rippled seams on the front and back of the panty part of these tights were highly visible under the dress for which I'd purchased them.  VERY unsightly.  Ugh."
2.0,"Nice product, but made for a short torso person, I am 5'8&#34; and it pulls length wise."
2.0,"The style is cute, and I got lots of compliments on it, but it started tarnishing after a couple of months, so I stopped wearing it. Not really worth the price."
2.0,Sent them back.  Too much of a hassle.
2.0,"trust me, you can't wear this outside, this is to wear under a long see through dress. I kept it anyways and wore around the house once. don't think it is worth it"
2.0,"Cute, but too tight for an adult"
2.0,Washed according to directions. After washing stitching was about to pull through thin fabric at seams.
2.0,"They run big!! Wide and long, so my thin daughter couldn't keep them up!"
2.0,This kitty is supposed to be Red Jasper...red color in some hue or another.  It is the color of a chocolate bar ..dark brown. It's really NOT pretty.  The silk adjustable cord does not open enough to get over an adult head. Really disappointed in my purchase.
2.0,Cute if you don't look too closely. A little cheap looking.
2.0,The earrings themselves are beautiful but the gold-plating must have nickel in it because my ears started throbbing and I knew it would get worse so I return them.
2.0,"The pages are made out of PVC. PVC will damage coins. While I don't believe that PVC will damage paper money, it will make your paper money smell like a shower curtain. So, I decided not to use this binder and I threw it away.<br /><br />I ordered some PVC free pages. The PVC free pages have 3 holes and fit into a 3-ring notebook binder. That way I can also add additional pages as needed."
2.0,"The shirt is cute, but see through, not very flattering, and kind of short. My chest is large and this shirt made it look worse."
2.0,"Poor quality, makes me think it's not an authentic polo."
2.0,There are as pictured but the backing came off of one the first time I tried them on.
2.0,Didn't care for the material it was made from.  The coat was a little bulky.
2.0,It is light weight good cros type Sandals but the bottom does not seem to be very groovy.. little nervous that is not that grippy and kid can easily slide on water surfaces
2.0,"It’s advertised as easy to put on but my husband can’t get them over his foot. I tried to help and was unsuccessful. From heel to toe they’re the correct size but they’re just too tight. I don’t think they’re the wrong size, I think older people with older hands are just going have difficulty with them."
2.0,"material feels cheap, colors are bright, size runs crazy small."
2.0,Mummm!  The style was nice but the bifocal was not in the right location on the lens.  I returned this item with no problems with the transaction.  Thanks!
2.0,"This is for the 3/4 Sleeve, Animal Print, Women Sexy V Neck Jumpsuit<br />I am 5'5"" and 180 lbs, very pear shaped. This fits fine at the top, but the bottom is another story; the pockets sit bulky right on the sides of your thighs (horribly unflattering), I don't mind the length but it is long. Again, I'm not the tallest person, so my torso is normal proportions as well, but this is riding up in the midsection and very uncomfortable. I want to return it, but I can't justify $10 in shipping (here and back) just to get rid of this.<br />Think long and hard about this one, folks."
2.0,"I hate to say this, this lanyard was nice and great to have until it caught the edge of a door handle as I was walking through and it broke apart as its supposed to do as I expected, except for when it hit the ground and broke the clip that holds the badge ID holder. Other than that, it worked fine!"
2.0,It is very fragile and hard to put on.
2.0,Not nearly nice as expected. Run small. Prefer the Costco / Kirkland equivalent that are 5 dollars cheaper.
2.0,Broke fairly quickly.
2.0,Disappointed way too small.
2.0,"Not very LARGE, not even big enough for a checkbook!"
2.0,"I've owned 4 pairs of these shoes. 3 with the low back arch and this pair. This pair is insanely squeaky compared to the low back arch ones.<br /><br />I've worn these to work for 1 week and one of the side strings has come loose. I work in an ac environment without you lot of wear on the shoes. The strings have come loose quickly on each pair I've owned.<br /><br />I guess I'll go back to different shoes after these. That sucks because they are comfortable, just not sturdy."
2.0,The dress runs very large and you cannot return or exchange it.
2.0,I give this a two star for its quality but it fits very well!
2.0,I bought a small and wear a 34C and the body suit is very baggy. Even trying it as tight as it would go.
2.0,1) I bought these goggles couple weeks ago and worked very nice no fog and leakage. But after two weeks of use they have started fogging.
2.0,They stink to high heavens it's disgusting.
2.0,Two of the four are so small and tight our 3 year old cannot even get it on.<br />Cute designs. But would not recommend due to the sizing.
2.0,Cheap chain. Broke in just one day.
2.0,I was really excited about this because my Fitbit kept falling out. Nevertheless when I got it I couldn’t get it on and then a week late my Fitbit dead.
2.0,"The concept of this necklace is really nice and it could be great f the chips looked better. The necklace I got had a lot of black, burnt looking chips while others were very pale and others falling off. Also, one side of the necklace was chunkier than the other. I requested an exchange, hoping that I had just gotten a defective piece, but was instead issued a refund, so who knows.<br /><br />I give it two stars because the fit was perfect on my neck."
2.0,"This was not as sparkly as expected, and after a month of wearing one of the purple stones came out."
2.0,"Fit is ok, but I had to rip the liner out. The liner was sewn in incorrectly leaving puffing out in various places. Plus the liner was way too small for the skirt. I just cut it out. It didn't need a liner."
2.0,Did not work for my boys 9 or 6 they kept falling down everytime they talked
2.0,"Super quality, super cute, NOT True to size"
2.0,Really pretty but the bottom piece broke off the first day I wore it.
2.0,"Looked very cute when came, but then the tassel part fell off before I got a chance to wear it!"
2.0,"The pendant itself seems sturdy enough and is a nice size, but I was disappointed as soon as I took it out of the package because of the color. While the photos make the flower petal stones appear pink or coral, in reality, they are violet/light purple. Since I just purchased this to wear to a 70's themed party with a particular coral/turquoise colored top, I may end up trying to paint the violet stones. For the price I paid, what can it hurt? I agree with the other reviews - the chain is ugly and cheap looking - I plan to trash it and replace it with a ribbon or something similar. Just remember - you get what you pay for."
2.0,"The ""paint"" on 3 pair of the glasses came off and blackened both sides of my nose.  One pair was broken when I received it.  Very poor quality.  You get what you pay for and I learned my lesson."
2.0,This was my second one same style / color and for some reason it was a lot larger - (the colors faded from use last year)<br />I returned it
2.0,"Quality is ok, way too large."
2.0,Lenses whiten and discolor around the edges.  Only use for casual wear.  No water or solvents used to clean.  Had item for short period of time when the discoloration started.
2.0,I usually wear a medium but bought a large. Fits like a small. Whoever buys this should go up 2 sizes
2.0,Unfortunately the print was too big making it hard to see what it was while wearing the mask. Also the mask it’s self was oversized.
2.0,This product is much smaller than the picture and the cross kept coming out and the necklace kept falling off...ended up taking it off after trying to get it to stay together several times.  :(
2.0,I received medium shorts and large top. Not that the medium shorts is more like a double zero... so Beware.<br /><br />The shirt is cute.
2.0,The tank tops run extremely small.
2.0,Buckle broke first try
2.0,"Not so great for me.  Lens, while nice and big, distorted my vision."
2.0,I already have several pairs of these sleep pants.<br />The fabric on these are awful and hot not comfortable like my others. There’s are a loose knit.<br />The insignia does not look authentic.
2.0,It was too big.. I should of gotten one size smaller. .
2.0,About the only thing good about these sunglasses are that they cover normal eyeglasses.  The lenses are blurry and hazy even in direct sunlight.  These glasses also do not appear to be polarized.  I would not order a second pair even if it were offered free.
2.0,For my tast this item was to large for me and there were no size of the item when I bought this.
2.0,The socks are comfortable for cycling.  The problem is they do not wash /dry well. There were no care instructions so I took caution and washed the first pair I wore on cold delicate cycle and dryed in the delicate cycle with fabric softener sheets. The socks came out the dryer with those annoying little lint balls. I will hang dry the next pair to see what happens.<br /><br />Updated review: I did as I said above and hang dried. The socks came out fine with no lint balls. Annoying to have to hang dry socks though.
2.0,"It fit nice in the upper part of dress but was not a flowing dress, straight through  the middle, hip areas. Quite disappointing!"
2.0,"Very cute, quite large but was actually never worn. I washed it first and has huge hole in to now. Unhappy I never got to enjoy it."
2.0,This jacket is not slim fit. I used measuring tape to ensure that the size I ordered was correct. And still too big. Sleeves long. Waist too big and just not the same fit as in the pic. Maybe because I'm smaller. I'm 5'4&#34; l40lbs.
2.0,"I did not like this one at all. The padding in the top moved around everywhere and would not stay still. Pretty much uncomfortable. I felt like my boobs were misshapen. There was no support. The bottoms were a little loose and very thin. same as the top there wasn’t much support.<br /><br />If your getting this to hide your love handles, I don’t recommend it. Still very visible on me. I’m 5’2 130 lbs and I’m a medium but this was a little loose."
2.0,It was OK.  I returned it because it wasn't really anything special.  5'6&#34; 165lbs 36DD
2.0,Goggles clasp broke on second use
2.0,👍🏼👎🏼
2.0,I purchased this item and it wasn't true to size. I had to return it because it was too small; the material is also too revealing.
2.0,I will never buy these again. The sole is glued on and it started coming off in no time.
2.0,"Look cute and quality seemed fine but didn’t work, they just rolled down."
2.0,The shirts were to stiff because of the iron on and cracked even when turned inside out when washed not good for the price
2.0,"It doesn’t really have the stretch fabric so it was so far up my behind that it looked like dental floss. The top fit okay, but I didn’t have a lot of room to be comfortable and the lack of elasticity in the top and bottom didn’t hold it to my body so it was falling off. The only reason the small bottoms didn’t fall off was because it was giving me the worst wedgie in the world. Super cute bathing suit but maybe not for someone with curves or someone planning to play volleyball because you don’t have wiggle room."
2.0,"Inexpensive does not always mean crap, but this is a cheap piece of crap, (from China).<br />Beware of the sharp edges<br />Once put together, the vertical rods screw into the base, these rods need to be bent straight and square.<br />It is not bronze, it is scrap metal that has some form of bronzed finish."
2.0,It is a half sweater I can not express this enough. It’s not just a shorter sweater but very very short beware. I have crop sweaters but this was too much for my age gave it to my teenage daughter.
2.0,IT did not it was why to small I think it was a kids size small !!!
2.0,"Worked great for about 2-3 weeks, but then the neoprene material inside started bunching up towards the top the belt. There isn't a way to stretch it back down without cutting a hole in it to pull it down. Now there's being clumps on the inside of the belt which pretty much makes it useless. Very disappointing."
2.0,It’s cute but the lettering is so small that you can hardly read it!
2.0,"Granddaughter loves it, but it is drenched in a horrible odor, like fabric softener.<br />The quality is mediocre at best."
2.0,it runs much smaller than the measurements indicate on the size chart.
2.0,Pants are at least 1 and a half sizes smaller than the size designated per measurements given.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Cute as all get out but one time through the wash and the orange is fading away. Not bad though if you're planning a &#34;one and done&#34; wear or if you don't mind the &#34;worn in look&#34;
2.0,"This tie bar was a big hit initially! It looked good, was boxed nicely, but the musical note fell off before the day was done and the person I bought it for couldn't even find the note to try to glue it back on!"
2.0,"I ordered both Large and Extra Large long sleeved, cold shoulder sweaters, I am 5'4"" and weigh 125lbs., the Large is tight."
2.0,Overpriced for what you get. One week out and I have some that has already stretched. Too much money. Save and buy gold bracelets instead
2.0,"These are very cute, but, very expensive, considering their price of $9.99 apiece (In June of 2020, I purchased 6 of them). According to the seller FCTRY you should be able to set the light mode by pressing its stomach (switch on and off; 1 hour; constant). I still haven't been able to set the mode on any of the 6 that I purchased. The instructions should come with the gummy bear. I don't think I will purchase them again, no matter how cute they are- they are essentially impractical."
2.0,Not worth the money. Didn't fit right and missed the return window. Way too low rise.
2.0,"The material is way too cheap, the fabric can tear easily when you move."
2.0,The ring looks like it should be adjustable but the ends are welded together. I was unable to wear it with my cosplay because I couldn't make the band bigger
2.0,Cheap made. Granddaughter loved it. Cant change time on it
2.0,In most cases using this was a bulkier option then storing things freely in my bag.
2.0,These took about a year to arrive. They are cute
2.0,"the push button terminals to activate the lights are faulty.  the one on the left works fine,  the one on the right must not have been soldered in place properly.  when turned to the right, there is no connection and the light turns off.  when turned to the left, it activates and flickers.  the cost of the item isn't worth the return shipping to send it back for a replacement.  oh well, it is still bright yellow and reflective so it functions as a running vest, but i wish it were higher quality."
2.0,"2xl fit like a medium. This was such a huge disappointment like seriously, I waited two weeks to find out about this result and thank god I gave it to someone that had a perfect size for it."
2.0,The hole to go to the bathroom is waaaaaaayyyy tooooo big . And indentions on your butt
2.0,"Considering that you're paying $2 for this, I guess it should be said, that you get what you pay for.<br />This item is coming out of what I suspect is a factory in China. You see on Amazon a cheap, cute piece of jewelry for like $1 with free shipping, and its nothing special but cute.  No problem.<br />So I expected the same with this item.  The metal is sufficient, and looks pretty enough.  However, the bottom cuff piece is attached backwards, making wearing it impossible without using another, simpler earcuff to secure it in place.<br />Thats a bit ridiculous.<br />I would give this item 5 stars, if it would be wearable without additional pieces."
2.0,I couldn't figure these out...
2.0,May look better on a tall slender person.
2.0,"I have purchased lenses for my Oakley glasses from Revant and they are great.  I was hoping to get the same experience for these replacement lenses, but I'm not pleased.  The lenses are a good fit length and width wise, but the thickness leaves much to be desired.  When you put them in your frame they move and wiggle and easily pop out when you try to clean the lenses with the bag.  I'll be sending these back.  If they were the same thickness as the original lenses, they would be perfect.  Revant: Please fix the thickness, this would be a great product if the thickness was correct."
2.0,While the diamonds are beautiful the screwbacks do not stay anchored and in a matter of 7 days one came off and one is already lost. I kept checking the backs and they kept coming loose.
2.0,I tightened the strands to the tightest and it was still a little loose.  Did not feel securely attached to my wrist.  I don't think that the biometrics would read right..
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:92334e6f044a75e995a7d33d9c263653]] For as much was spent—it arrived in just a bag NO box or any sort of protection to prevent damages. It feels and looks cheap, paying for name not quality. Disappointed."
2.0,"This is prettier on the picture, but one cold water wash and it had streaks all over, super think fabric and itchy tag that cannot be removed without damaging the piece. Very disappointed!"
2.0,Not compression and don’t stay up for squats or burpees!
2.0,I bought 4 and wish I hadn't. The Ergodyne N-Ferno 6821 Fleece Balaclava are very large. They do not fit my teenage grandsons or my son in law. I am going to try and return them.
2.0,It did not look like the image. My purse was missing the bow. The straws start breaking off after a week of use.
2.0,Wasn't as big as I thought it would be
2.0,"Good quality product, especially for the price. But they sent the wrong size and when I reordered they kept sending the wrong size."
2.0,"Looks nice, but fairly uncomfortable (no interior cushion/padding) and exterior rips easily. Worn 3 days for just casual city commuting."
2.0,The glasses have so much potential but are off. By off I mean they sit crooked on my face. My ears aren’t crooked and I don’t have this issue with other glasses.. you get what you pay for I suppose.
2.0,"There was only one review so I took a chance.  The vest is kind of odd.  The Noth Face emblem on the front is not white like it is in the picture, the thread is the exact color of the vest (in my case olive green) so you really can't see it at all.  I wouldn't have minded that if the vest fit better but it seems to have extra large arm holes and no real shape to it. It's lightweight and in my opinion unremarkable, nothing special for the price.  Returning it."
2.0,Super small was something I should have returned
2.0,looked good. fell apart second time i wore it.
2.0,I ended up returning this product. It looks just like the photo except it was too short on me. I am 5'10 and it was a shirt length on me. Definitely an item for a shorter person.
2.0,Very thin material. It didn’t cost a lot of money and it looks that way - cheap.
2.0,The XXL fits a medium size. The sizing is so wrong on this. Worst 20.00 I spent on. Shorts are cute by picture. So if you are bigger in size it won't fit it.
2.0,Does not have a flattering cut also would prefer it in cotton fleece.  I find it too hot in the synthetic.
2.0,This tunic very extremely thin and way too big. It was not a flattering fit. The thin material was almost see through.
2.0,"Wanted to like these shorts and they might be cute if you weren’t worried about them falling off, also very see through."
2.0,Certainly not as advertised.  Poorly made.
2.0,Ordered up a size after reading the reviews. Do not order if you are even slightly over a B cup. Not meant for anyone with a larger chest. Wish the neck line was a little lower that would’ve helped a little. It’s a cute shirt but I seriously wouldn’t waste your money on it if you have a big chest.
2.0,I only gave two stars because it made my boobs into a uniboob. After one wash it was unusable.
2.0,I ordered this for my son. When we opened stitching was coming undone in a few spots. If you order this the slippers run small. His feet hang off the back.
2.0,"Poor fit, instructions no help"
2.0,NOT LONG ENOUGH AS ADVEERTISED!
2.0,Can't figure out how to make it smaller to fit my wrist. Don't want to take it to a jeweler.
2.0,Slow shipping and poor quality.
2.0,It broke one day after warring it.😔
2.0,Not the right product!!!<br />Got star trek instead of black butler.<br />It's still pretty but not what I played for!
2.0,I got it for my son for his birthday cuz he thought it was so cool lol.. But it Rips super easy in arm pits & shoulders.. And roses fell off within 2 days with the first jacket then I got a replacement and that one lasted barely a week.. I ended up sending both back.. Sucks cuz it looked nice & my son is bummed!
2.0,The material is cheap and it does not fit as expected.  The elastic above the breasts does not hold.
2.0,"If you have a GUT then order one size bigger. I did and was happy I did, otherwise your normal size would probably fit.  Collar is skimpy in size...doesn't ""stand"". The quality of this shirt is overall poor...fabric, tailoring, durability (I can tell it won't last). You better dry clean this one. The breast pocket is huge...big enough for two wallets. I'll wear it until I get sick of it, then give it to Goodwill."
2.0,"Used on a pair of lighter colored mesh and leather HOKAs.  It didn't clean the dirt on the mesh.  Followed the instructions, including the longer soak time.  Redid with spray in wash first then soaked in mild laundry detergent plus oxygen clean with the result of clean shoes.  Maybe would have worked better on dark shoes."
2.0,Very large for a large
2.0,This product is not the color shown in the picture? It is a mint green. It fits as expected but it isn’t as long as the picture either. I am 5’4” and it comes to my ankles. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Unfortunately as soon as I put them on and then squatted down (that's how I test all my yoga/workout clothing), the crotch seam ripped and now there's a hole.  Aside from that, they are a little short in the legs, but fit relatively well for things other than yoga."
2.0,I ordered a 2 X even though a 1X is really a little too big for me.  I like to wear heavy flannel hoodies around the house so I wanted a coat that was large enough to fit over them and something I would be able to scoop snow in.  I can not comfortably get the coat zipped with even a light hoodie on.  Also the pockets set up too high on the jacket to be able to access my gloves that barely fit in them!  Needless to say I returned the coat!
2.0,I really wanted to like them but several were broken and the trays weren't centered in most. Disappointed.
2.0,Looks cheap and it is small. Will be okay for a kid.
2.0,I normally take a medium.  This was way too large under my bust.  Fabric was nice but the shirt was a bit short.  The MAIN PROBLEM was that the sleeves hung a FOOT past my arms!
2.0,"Wanted to love this. The material is comfortable and the color is pretty, but I'm 5'2&#34; and it was too short on me. It hit above my ankle bones and was just an awkward length. Had to return."
2.0,was not what I had expected felt is looked cheap. Not a true Patenet Leather look more like vinyl.
2.0,these are children earrings.
2.0,To tight on toes
2.0,"not 100% cotton as listed by the seller.  says polyester blend right on the package.  this is the kind of item I'd be better off buying in a store.  took a chance, not too happy with them."
2.0,"Had this bag before ,brought it about 1 yr ago at outlet center loved it so much that when the zipper broke wanted to get the exact same bag found it on amazon but unfortunately  had to return  it because it was dry rot bag ripped open after 3 days of use"
2.0,Bend easy
2.0,"Never again I am going to buy skirts or anything else on Amazon. Cheap, cheap, cheap. $3 at most."
2.0,"very small, size up."
2.0,I ordered them for a friend who is a size 10.<br /><br />The socks are waaaaay too small and tight and also the fabric is very thin and doesn't feel cozy.<br /><br />I'm a size 7.5 and will keep them for myself but I would not order them again.<br /><br />Update: I washed them and now they are more like a size 6. :(
2.0,It was a nice light weight material but just a bit too small and this is before the first laundry.
2.0,"Honestly, not what I expected. From the quality of fabric to the size, I am disappointed."
2.0,I waitress & when running around I still have a hard time breathing in the mask.i felt like I was hyperventilating. It was bad. And it was very hot too.
2.0,A lot of the glasses were broken
2.0,"It’s too small. Not a size 7.5 like I ordered. Other than that, it’s what is expected for the price."
2.0,Hat was dark cream not white as adver tised.
2.0,Runs a little tight
2.0,I didn't like this too much. Did not fit me and it was kinda broken. I really was hoping that it would be really cool. But I wasn't satisfied.
2.0,Fit was very odd and there were holes in the pockets...it felt comfortable though.
2.0,It is a good shirt and fits perfect. The only problem we have is that barb fades every time you wash it.
2.0,"Ordered a Medium , waaay to right. High waisted yes, but the scrunched part is to high up to lift. Definitely not an alternative to TikTok leggings if that’s what your wanting. If I had time to return only being off on sundays I would"
2.0,"They don't fit well because they don't have heel stitching (that diagonal stitching that makes socks fit the heel of your foot), it makes them awkward."
2.0,A lot thinner and lighter weight than expected.  Seems to be cheaply made - you could do a lot better for $29.
2.0,"I bought the biggest size, I’m about 135 lbs, and it was insanely tight at the waist."
2.0,"Faulty clasp, had to return it.  :("
2.0,"I originally got this for my CNA classes that I was taking and they required a watch. I hated the idea of having a wrist watch, and opted for this. And while it worked it was wonderful! In dim lighting its very hard to read the time, but in well lit rooms it was fabulous to just look down at my pocket, where it was out of the way not getting caught on anything and see the time. But it only lasted for about a two and a half weeks before it eventually stopped working properly. First the hands stopped in place and just kept twitching a little where ever the hands ended up landing on when the problem started. Then shortly after it completely stopped. I could probably have just changed the battery, but even with a watch like this I would have been more inclined to keep it if it actually lasted a little while longer. But having no guarantee that changing the battery would fix the broken hands of the watch, I opted for going for something a little more pricey that actually will last me for a while. Overall, it was cute, it was useful while it lasted, and you get what you pay for... Maybe a little less."
2.0,I have a broad chest/back so it’s a little difficult to wear but is only being used for a Halloween photo shoot so it will be fine for that
2.0,"Very little down in the jacket,"
2.0,"These are not sweat pants, they are leggings, disappointing"
2.0,Too small but they are beautiful
2.0,"The material was kind of cheapy, but the style is pretty cute. Too big for me - I'm 5.3 120 lbs and a small was too long and a little too loose. Maybe if it were steamed/pressed really well, and on someone a little taller, someone who could fill it out - it could be really cute? I sent it back."
2.0,"These are some dollar store quality sandals. Cheap vinyl like material uppers attached to a heavy bottom that flops around as you walk. Buy cheap, expect poor quality I guess. Was hoping for nicer though."
2.0,Fabric is extremely cheap quality.
2.0,"They look nice, feel nice, fit nicely but even after months and numerous washings they still bleed on sheets and clothes."
2.0,Its cute but you have to wear shorts ot leggings under it because the liner is way too shprt
2.0,Do not like material. Cheap ugly buttons.
2.0,Cute dress but it’s see through
2.0,The top of the shirt is too big/baggy and the bottom of the shirt is too small. Would probably fit fine if you don't have hips!
2.0,Too small and bad quality. The first time I put on it got tear off. I am very sad about it.
2.0,Xl is too short
2.0,It's klunky.
2.0,"The color is silver, the picture looks white. Poor quality of shoe."
2.0,"I'd say this sweater fits more or a S/M instead of a One Size Fits 4-12 I'm 5'9 140 I normally wear S/M and It for sure is not relaxed , slouchy or oversized. The length is not as long as pictured nor are the sleeves long ( more like 3/4 sleeve ) The color was exactly as described and pictured but over all disappointed in the fit."
2.0,"These were WAY too small! My sister is 2-3 sizes smaller than me and they are tight on her! I couldn't even get them paat my knees! They definitely get that stretched, white fabric look to them when stretched so wouldn't classify these as 'not see through'. The material did seem comfortable, and my sister confirmed, which is their only saving grace. The pattern was just as advertised"
2.0,Only lasted a couple weeks before the bands that hold it together started breaking. Ultimately fell apart and now I have a handful of beads.
2.0,I ordered a small and they fit as a medium or large. Not very flattering.
2.0,"Just picked one up to protect my passport from the heavy handling during my travels.  It's rather bulky and not rigid enough to keep your passport from bending or getting kinked.  Move along folks, shop somewhere else!"
2.0,"Cute suit, but it was a lot smaller than expected. The material was a little bit cheap too."
2.0,Bought this ring as it resembles my actual engagement ring. I figured this would be good for vacations and such. This ring was weird. The gaps in between the diamond rings in the center are huge. You can see the support connectors. Wasn’t for me.
2.0,"The blond is not blond. It is white. Very disappointed, but it is too expensive to ship and return. I would suggest taking better photos. For buyers, I would suggest going to an actual costume shop. I needed this to match a wig, and the photo looked exactly the right color."
2.0,"Being 5'4&#34; and 175lbs, I bought the size 14 because I'm a consistent 14, but the torso was very short. The best line feel right below my breasts, which I thought was odd because I am a short woman. The bathing suit itself seemed to be made well with good material, however."
2.0,These are apparently made for 5 year old Asians. My daughter is tiny and couldn't even get them past her knees. We ended up having to cut the whole crotch and waistband out for her to wear them like knee highs. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,Not 10mm. 9mm at best. Measured with a caliper. Disappointed because another product I bought from same place had similar issue. Not worth my time to send back.<br /><br />The product itself is good for what it is but if you want to taper up to 00GA you've been warned.
2.0,Broke in a week :(
2.0,I give it to my grand daughter
2.0,Lettering too large
2.0,A)  the velvet is on the inside.  These should say velvet lined...  B)  I wear a size 8 jeans and the waist on these is so so so tight that it's incredibly uncomfortable.  Ill be returning.
2.0,"Cheap looking, cheap feel, and cheaply made. Clip is terrible. It is not articulated in such a way to allow easy opening. I had to take my glasses off and put these on. The clip goes right over the lenses and the cheap rubber on them comes off or rips with hardly any wear, leaving your lens susceptible to scratches. Would not buy again."
2.0,I didn't realize this would be a kid's buckle. none of my canvas belts would fit.
2.0,"Doesn't fit the way the picture shows. A bit doubty of my figure (5ft 4, 36C, 200lbs)"
2.0,These were not made well.  They are really cute but they zipper area was not sewn correctly and it rubbed terrible.  I had to return them.
2.0,"I ordered a SM-M and it fits horribly, I have a small frame, and this shirt seems more like it's meant for a girl with football players shoulders.  It only looks right when I have my hands on my hips and my arms out wide, the rest of the time it looks like my clothes are falling off of me!"
2.0,El encaje de las mangas es muy sencillo. Se rompió al momento de usarlo
2.0,Did not like these.  I ordered two.  Did not like chain at all.  No packing slip that I could tell how to return.
2.0,Does fit like expected. Like having cup over nose/mouth.
2.0,"Nice size and color but product description  states 100% coton which is true BUT thr white portion is some kind of  plastic and will not accept  dye, not to good for crafts"
2.0,"These earrings look nice in the picture, but when I wear them they seem too big for my liking. I ended up returning them and order a slightly different style. I wish they had a picture of the earrings on a model to show their actual size and style."
2.0,Not really small but u less you’re 5’5” or have no belly way too short.
2.0,"Too small, not as expected. On the pityre is looks larger. There were no size dimensions in the description."
2.0,I liked them but very fragile they cracked above the lens also coating wears off making them feel rough.
2.0,"That size chart is waaay off! My bust line is 41-43 inches depending on the day of the week.  I chose an XL so I could get the big slouchy fit, as the chart indicated that was around 50 inches in the bust.  Haha ... negative.  I've taken a photo here, its the only one I could get that wasn't completely embarrassing because it is really cute. I can get it on ... but that's it.  I don't understand how the size chart can be at least 10 inches off.  Its a shame, I love the style and the print but this one either needs to wait till I lose 40 pounds or I donate it.  Even if I donate it I plan to cut the size tag out to avoid it being mislabeled as a real xl."
2.0,"I ordered a large-sized one based on the chart but still ran small. The shin guards are wide, short and don't stay on the shin. Not easy to wear for a soccer match"
2.0,"Thin material. It's water resistant but NOT waterproof per advertisement. My shirt is still damp after using this for dishes. Not terrible, but I wouldn't buy again. There's better waterproof aprons out there."
2.0,It is see through so I guess I'll just be using it for a bathing suit cover up. Thats what this should be advertised as not a dress. Also the back came down way further on me than it did on the girl in the picture
2.0,I can’t have open gauges at work so these mad it really easy to use but it sucks because they are hard to clean because alcohol eats the silicone
2.0,"This watch is very cute, but that's it. It looses time...about an hour a day on a good day, sometimes much more."
2.0,Strange fit in the armpit area
2.0,"Zipper placed in the buttocks, not very easy to maneuver if you’re  on the full side. Definitely not straight leg, bell bottom . Disappointed because this is not what I was expecting."
2.0,Expected print on both sides. Only had print on the front
2.0,Left leg on the bodysuit has a 2 inch hole in the hem of it.
2.0,I love the design but it was too big for my child. I don't even think I will ever use them
2.0,I cant charge my phone with this case...the hole is to small
2.0,It’s like satin shorts sewn to thick nylon compression leggings. Extremely heavy weight and binds at the crotch.
2.0,"The buckle tongue from the band fell out of the package when I opened it. I installed the band on my watch and then tried to manually reinsert the tongue but the nylon was ripped, so there was no way it would hold anyway. I was excited when I got the package five minutes ago and now I've already submitted a refund request. Not great."
2.0,The material was not the best quality. I only weigh 140 pound and I'm 5'6 and it was so small my body looked like a sausage link.
2.0,shirt different color from jeans and is extremely small
2.0,"My daughter saw this cat and LOVED it by the picture. As you can see by my photos, the one they send you looks like a gorilla-cat. Extremely disappointed, especially for this price."
2.0,size not as advertised
2.0,Cheap and dont work well...
2.0,"I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and the top was way too small. The pants fit, but a bit snug. I would suggest order two to three sizes larger than you normally wear."
2.0,"These are totally cheap earrings. First off, they arrived bent, which is a pretty good indication of the quality of the metal. Second, after being worn for about two days, the &#34;rose gold&#34; effect has completely warn off the post, back, and parts of the basket.<br />The only good thing that I can say for these is that they seem to at least be hypoallergenic.<br />You get what you pay for."
2.0,I was pretty excited for this novel pricing but when I pit it on the screw on seemed to be stripped and it turns too far when tightened. The bottom sits in place fine but the topbiss turned to the side... bummer<br />Other than that I do like it though. Very pretty.
2.0,"I got my daughter a medium. Shes 5'2 @100 lbs. It fit great. But the leotard was cheaply made. It started to peel around the waist where the belt was and then the jewels on the belt didnt stay on, they came lose and fell off. The cape was the only reliable item. It did look nice while it lasted."
2.0,"Looks pretty but the strap doesn’t bend well,  the strap holder falls apart easily. Smells too strong."
2.0,The size is a bit small.
2.0,I'm disappointed in these they only lasted 3 months. The cheap kiwi laces I've bought from local shoe stores last 5 - 6 months. I figured with kevlar these would last at least 6 months. I also bought some honey badger laces with these they are in my boots now. We will see how they do.
2.0,"I had to return. I have bought cheaper dresses on Amazon with much better quality. It fit fine, so for that I gave it an extra star, but the material is cheap and not at all as described. Don't waste your time or money."
2.0,Too plasticy.
2.0,"I purchased these from the great reviews, but quickly was disappointed. The material is thick and cut generously for good coverage. Unfortunately, they quickly stretched out and are saggy in the backside, resulting in discomfort and constant picking/readjusting. Would not purchase again."
2.0,"Looks cheap, I'll wear it around the house"
2.0,The straps were freakishly too long. There is no way these will stay on anyone's foot
2.0,Large for my bald head even though it says &#34;one size fits all&#34;
2.0,Doesn't fall well on the body.
2.0,Broke right away. I glued it back together
2.0,The product was nice but did not look right on me. Over sized for my face.
2.0,the nylon on the strap is perfect color and thickness- the metal connecting and the clip are very flimsy and can easily bend- would not recommend using on something with use. its only a matter of time it breaks and is lost.
2.0,"So large and big in certain spots, like around the hips the material was giant"
2.0,This was NOT what the picture portrayed. It was NOT  a dressy affair. It was a NIGHTGOWN at best.
2.0,I thought that the quality and look of the earrings were beautiful.... But... The ball on the back of the earring doesn't screw off the front piece does and it is very difficult to get it on. Not happy with this at all!
2.0,"I like it, it looks absolutely amazing, however the links are very weak and have broken multiple times so I’ve had to fix it a couple times. Even slight snags will open a link. It also tends to bind up, but that’s inevitable."
2.0,I am usually a medium on the top but this was not fitted so I will be ordering a small
2.0,After the number three numbers are upside down the band is nice but the watch part disappointed
2.0,"I was very disappointed in this product....not the product itself but the hype about the feeding program.  I assumed 100% of the dollars spent which was $60, went to the children.  When I received the product there was a tag on it that indicated only $20.00 went to the children...where is the rest of the $$$!!!  AND the bag was made in CHINA --- which was insult to injury.  Knowing all that, I would have sent $60 to the org and fed three children vs one and forgot the bag.<br />I sent the bag back over three weeks ago and still have not been contacted or credited the money ... Amazon and World Food ..shame on you!"
2.0,"Cute, but way smaller than the picture shows. Also, not be best quality of stone"
2.0,I ordered these for walking upon the recommendation of a friend.  Ordered an XL (I wear a size 12 jean) and they were just too tight to be comfortable.
2.0,Price tells the quality…
2.0,returned - too small
2.0,No ..the black holders on the end keep sliding off.. no ..not what I wanted
2.0,"i ended up completely taking off the moons because they were HUGE and the pendent would literally just go under it and it would look bad, the chain is real, and the pendents are cute but the moon kinda messed up the whole ""matching necklace"" vibes :/"
2.0,"The sleeves are really tight, it is a weird top that I did not like. The pants are great."
2.0,"Very pretty, however, ordered 6mm for tragus piercing and was sent 3mm. Too short.."
2.0,"Runs super small. If you have any chest at all ...run! There's no way an average 38D, size 14/16 gal can wear this in any size! I bought the biggest! Otherwise, it's super cute!"
2.0,It fit me super well. Im not skinny in the waist so it is a little tighter up there but I fold the top and that seems to help. Its super flattering but I definitely noticed it becoming lighter in color at the butt seam.
2.0,Ordered  women's XL and they fit a child's size 12
2.0,"Really awkward shape in the toe box. The material there flares up and isn't smooth and flush as in the pic. This distorts the fit. This causes lots of space above the toes, which means the shoe won't bug and your feet will slide down and jam into the point of the shoe."
2.0,the bigger ring broke and it turned my fingers green
2.0,I really loved these earrings but I never got to wear them because the class broken one. It was too much hassle to return such a small product
2.0,Very thin more like stockings as opposed to socks.
2.0,"These are adorable and I bought them to use as my ""wedding shoes"" since I am getting married on the beach.  I have tried them all on once and when I tried the one with the ""stones"" a second time to see if it would work with my dress it just fell off my foot.  I might try to tie it together with fishing line because it is so cute, but I'm afraid it might do it again.  The two elastic ones are a little less comfy on my foot, but I think they are stronger."
2.0,"It's cute, but not the size advertised."
2.0,I got this dress for a baby shower. It was supposed to be pink but is actually very much peach colored. The dress I received had a printed pattern line right across the stomach. I am returning it.
2.0,"When I saw the description of the item, they said that the bracelet will fit all sizes, but this wasn't true. I got one for my husband and one for me, my husband could not wear his because it was too small, and mine was too big and it didn't have the ability to be tied smaller. I'm very disappointed with this product."
2.0,Way too small could fit my 6 year old cousin.
2.0,"Its ok, served its purchase"
2.0,This dress was nice it wasn’t bad. I would say if you’re shorter than 5’6” then this dress will just drag. Also it’s a bit plain looking but I think that it’s perfect for dressing up like if you want to add a hat and some jewelry and whatnot but if you are simple and just want to wear a dress with some sandals this isn’t the dress.
2.0,"Runs very small.  Fabric also inferior.  Also, beware they charged me a 20% restocking and it cost me another $10 to ship it back for a refund."
2.0,"This sweatshirt was super cute. The colors came just as bright as pictured. It was not too lightweight nor too heavy. The issue was that it is just WAY. TOO. SMALL. I cannot envision any adult female actually looking light this fit her. It's child size all over, especially the length of the crop, but also in the bust. The elastic around the waist is also a bit too tight. Returning it."
2.0,"This shirt is more tent than tunic. I usually wear a lg-xl and per the comments, I bought a 2x. It &#34;fits&#34;, however, it is less shapely than the picture shows, as the fabric drops straight from the armpits. The arms are pretty tight, and the fabric is unforgiving. The strangest thing is the way the front hem of the shirt hits your shins as you bend over-- weird. All of that being said, putting a small rouching stitch through about 5&#34; of the front middle changes the whole look of the shirt enough to make it wearable! If I had a printer, I would have returned it, but I don't, so I fixed it : )"
2.0,"This bag has a cute vintage design - love the screen printed bicycle on the front and the woven fabric/vinyl pieces on the bottom. I love the neutral, muted colors (off-white, army green, black, brownish - burgundy). It has heavy duty faux leather handles with metal fittings, interior pockets (1 larger one, 2 smaller for pens/cell phone) and I can haul alllll my stuff in it. However, the woven pieces at the bottom aren't finished and started fraying the first day I started using this bag. It looks messy and I'm going to have to get fraycheck to seal the fabric edges so it doesn't continue, but the edges are frayed now so don't look quite as polished. The lining is a cheaper fabric that is already pilling and looking shabby. (Don't get that since I pack stuff in separate makeup-sized bags that I put in this bag, I don't have loose items rubbing against the interior fabric.) I don't think this brand is quite on par with other companies that make upcycled type bags (Mona B comes to mind). Disappointing."
2.0,cheaply made. pretty color tho.
2.0,The item was not properly sewed. It had loose string on the out parts of purse. Immediately returned.
2.0,"The coloring of the wire tree started turning silver just a day or two after wearing. I thought it was copper, obviously not. 😕"
2.0,"It fit well, but the color was a bit faded. Not as expected. It’s also very thin. I didn’t wear it."
2.0,These were a waste of $$.  They were very uncomfortable and ran about a size smaller!
2.0,Price too high for a little novelty gift
2.0,They certainly fit my daughter and she thought the case was cute.  However they are certainly NOT polarized.
2.0,"This runs a little small but none the less a great tank-top! I purchased the Large and could've gone up a size. The quality of the material is super soft! If you're looking for a good concert tank-top, out with friends, or bonfire nights I highly recommend this one!"
2.0,Needed to buy a insole. To hard. Flexed with foot well. Problem only lasted a couple months as the rubber on the bottom snapped .
2.0,"Material was great quality.  I got a size up, and it was still too small though"
2.0,Paper like bottom but they were cute. Also a bit small for my child!
2.0,Product says 12 but only has 8 in the package.
2.0,Was light weight but was big and fits like a sack and can’t adjust the string around waist. There is no draw string to adjust size
2.0,Backing won’t peel off making them useless as adhesive mustaches.
2.0,Did not expect it to be not one piece as it has separate parts (the jewels all hang separate) which was strange. Once it lays flat on u it has the illusion of once piece. Looks like costume jewelry.
2.0,"Cheap,m material, unflattering."
2.0,These are thin and cheap.  Not heavy enough to replace most watch straps
2.0,Color is different from pic
2.0,"Newton is a great for running. What their problem sizes . It. Always too big or too small. My size 6,5 I order Size 7,5 , cuz  running shoes must be at least half size bigger. So 7,5 of this one was very tight for me. It’s not first time like this."
2.0,"I've worn dressed by this brand before, but his was a total miss. I don't even know how to explain how bad this material is. The material is rough and abrasive but not necessarily itchy. It manages to be wrinkly and structured at the same time. I unfortunately didn't try it on right away and missed the return window."
2.0,Extremely small compared to what the picture looked like.  They did give dimensions but I assumed that was the size of the earring part; instead it was the size of the earring plus the wire.
2.0,"Wide, bulky waistband showed through skirt"
2.0,"I was so excited about these. They came this evening and I found them to be snug, but comfortable (I wear a 7 1/2) and the little  Tinkerbell tufts were adorable. Sadly, within an hour and a half, the right tuft came off. I'm totally inept when it comes to sewing, so now I'm just bummed. Reminds me of the Snoozies sequined slippers I got for Christmas...I started losing sequins the second day. Fast forward a month and a half and my carpet had more sequins than my slippers. Fool me twice, shame on me. Boo."
2.0,Size runs small; material is low quality
2.0,"Poor quality. We ordered for Christmas mass and they did wear them, but quality control was very poor. One of the ribbons had a big water stain on it but u did not notice until we were putting it on and heading out the door."
2.0,Sleeves are really tight
2.0,Good enough quality but chain is definitely not 22 inches. More like 12. Disappointed.
2.0,For some reason this color fits weird.  Uncomfortable and unflattering.  I’ve purchased several pairs of these and just suck.
2.0,Uncomfortable and Lowkey hurts. numbs after a minute not in a good way. Good for a few good pics other then that not optimal. Also very skinny. Kinda too skinny.
2.0,The bottom band is a bit snug. Overall this top is not a great fit.
2.0,It is VERY difficult to fold it back up and the spokes must be manually folded/unfolded every time.
2.0,"Kinda cheap looking but my Daughter and 3 yr old granddaughter loved it, so that's what mattered. Probably won't buy from this vendor again."
2.0,"Although the leather is soft and bag is roomy, quality was WAY LESS than I expected from Joy<br />Bag looked like it was assembled in seconds - can see through the seams - no liner in bag<br />not as many pockets as I thought it would have - I had to trim threads from the bag handles<br />Worse part of all IT SMELLS LIKE FORMALDEHYDE! I still cannot use because I cannot get<br />rid of that smell! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2.0,"This is a cute necklace;  however, the letters were placed going opposite ways, which obviously defeats the purpose.  Hoping for a refund or exchange for the necklace made correctly.  Will update."
2.0,Poor visibility thru these glasses.
2.0,There's a reason the model has her hand on her side. The shirt is shapeless. Just a square with straps & zipper.
2.0,Not long enough and totally see through
2.0,Didn’t come with the pen!! It says it comes “with pen”!
2.0,The lanyard itself is good quality but I'm still sad that it's a raven instead of an eagle ☹
2.0,they are perfect for what I wanted but they arrived with one that the back came off when I put them on the first time..sooo I tried three times to glue it  back..will wait until morning to see if holds.. so sad for they are darling...Any ideas???
2.0,"The ribbon on the outer edge tore and is ripping off.  My daughter only wore this three times.  I am disappointed of the quality of the ribbon sewn on the tutu.  She loved it when she first got it. She still loves it, but the ribbon is dangling on one side of her tutu.  :("
2.0,this won't go over your foot but makes nice bracklet
2.0,"I thought this would be more wear-able but it looks cheap costumey, and somewhat stripper-ish. It fit, but I will never wear it, but am keeping it for the hopes that it will come in handy for halloween one year."
2.0,To bad this is not better quality metal. Broke right away. Sad because it is very pretty. But not wearable.
2.0,"The yoga pants were an XL, but fit my teenaged daughter who typically wears size SMALL women's clothing. The print is great, and they're cute on her, but run several sizes small."
2.0,Made a good gift
2.0,"I would have returned them if I didn't completely forget that I bought them. They're not worth it. There's a little lace design along the edges that are really uncomfortable. If the underwear were a little bigger and didn't have the plastic feeling outline, they would be okay. They hug the legs too tightly because of the liner."
2.0,no style to it
2.0,Runs small to fit.  For the money don't expect to get much protection in very cold weather . Good as a short use pair of gloves.
2.0,Cheap metal.  Stone not sparkly. Sad. Said free returns so I tried it and the day I received it I tried to return it and was told it is non-returnable.  Not cool.
2.0,Glasses were not oversized! That was the purpose of getting them. Don't feel like sending back. You lied!!!
2.0,The quality is ok but it does not reach the floor unless you are under 5ft fall!
2.0,"The dress in the photo has much more shape. I am 5'11 and not particularly hippy but the way that the dress flares out along the bottom hem and also at the hip is very unflattering. Besides that I found it simply ill fitting and just kind of cheap in the hand. The photo in the description is optimizing the product. In real life, it is disappointing."
2.0,This is really cute but the color of the metal rubs off after one time wearing it. It turns to an ugly bronze color and then it doesnt match the rest of the necklace. Its an okay length (a little short) but has an awful smell. I always have to wash my hands after touching it or wearing it.
2.0,This swimsuit is too small (order at least two sizes up). The top is not suitable for large breast (34DD+) the white underneath is exposed.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this. When I first opened it, I did love it. When I went to  put my stuff in it, I was very disappointed. Several of the card slots are to small for my cards, on a few sections, when you put items in the pockets/slots, in covers up the snaps so that you can't close it. If the pockets and slots were just a tad bigger, it would be perfect. Love the feel and look of this, just gonna have to trash it, I can't use it."
2.0,Very cute shirt if your Asian. Ordered large and it was too short and too tight.
2.0,The color is horrible!  Nothing like the photo!
2.0,Very tight in arms chest and doesn't flow out like the picture shows. Love this brand but not the style
2.0,The front pocket seam is pulled open and material is freying. The bag came this way. Very disappointing.
2.0,"I have difficulty getting this umbrella to snap open.  In a pouring rain storm, this is not good.  I had to walk manually holding it open from the store to my car the last time I used it."
2.0,"I have had this item for YEARS and it has been a lifesaver (especially in PNW waters) I used it so much ot started to tear in half, and I still used it even then.<br /><br />Wanting to order another one, maybe even 2... However I can't find how to pick my size?<br /><br />The standard size available is a kids size.<br />If sizing becomes available will increase review to 5* instantly!!!"
2.0,I ordered 2 of these for my bridesmaids and although they look very pretty they both smell strongly of mildew.  I don't have time to return them so I'm just using lots and lots of Lysol spray on them over and over to try and get the smell out.  I'm really disappointed because these were the prettiest but definitely not the cheapest rhinestone clutch purses I found.  Would not recommend.
2.0,"The material is cute but very thin. It did fit as expected according to the chart but the bra cup is very thick, hard and kind of pointy."
2.0,Wasn't as comfortably fitting as I thought it would be. However I havn't been able to test out how warm they are since the warmer whether arrived before they got to me.
2.0,"Arrived with the stone detached from the ear wire.  Easily fixed, but disappointing."
2.0,It was a beautiful ring but my finger turned green in just a day :/. I was very disappointed
2.0,"First let me say I love Harvey’s. This bag is gorgeous, like all the rest in my collection. Unfortunately, it was shipped without the strap. I contacted Amazon and was offered $5, but this surely isn’t enough to purchase the strap that should have been included. Disappointing. :("
2.0,"I was hoping these glasses would be a solution to my reading in bed and my nagging back problems.<br />I find these glasses are too heavy and uncomfortable to wear to a point where I have sore spots on my nose.<br />The peripheral vision of these glasses is also very limited.<br /><br />The concept of these glasses is great, but the next generation prism glasses hopefully uses lighter materials that would allow a wider field of vision.<br /><br />Update August 4:<br />I can't help it, but it's been nagging on me to update this review.  I have not worn these glasses for several weeks and my nose is still bruised from wearing them. I never wore these glasses any longer than 20 minutes at a time when I did use them and yet they left their marks. They weigh 3.2 oz versus 0.9 oz for one of my regular reading glasses."
2.0,Way too small. I ordered larger just for this reason. 38b was like 34b side boob included. Next time I'll have to order a 40. Oh wait....thats right.<br />Being returned.
2.0,"If you are trying to get a product that looks like gold, don't buy this product."
2.0,"Cheap material, wrinkles easily and the elastic used at the top was too cheap, thin, almost rubber band-like.  The elastic alone makes the skirt uncomfortable."
2.0,"Loved the look and feel of the watch. A couple of issues which led to it being returned. One, the watch stopped when you took it off, so you had to set it each morning. Two, after about a week, the set stem unscrewed; it comes off in the direction that you have to set it. I hated to return it but I had to once that happened."
2.0,Got a lot of compliments! Everything about the bracelet was beautiful. Except for the part where it started to tarnish after about 2 weeks. 😟 I got the silver one. Supposedly S925 sterling silver.
2.0,Raw means raw not really fashion worthy
2.0,"Mine was a full size too small.  Other comments about the print looking deceptive in the photo are accurate, however, I would have worn it if it fit."
2.0,"Not what I expected at all, for some reason it just reminded me of a table cloth. Never even gave it that chance and tried it on. Didn’t like the Material and looked cheap."
2.0,"Very soft, but poorly sewn. There are already holes at the seams and it's only been worn for a month. If you're looking for quality, shop elsewhere."
2.0,Just ok. Stone fell out within a week
2.0,"Really cute, smaller than I thought, which was a good, because it was cute a dainty. However the bar is SO SHORT, the manufacture should considering making the bars 8mm"
2.0,Look carefully at the design online. It arrived and I thought I got front was missing but actually it is the back that is bear completely
2.0,Cute but very small for the price
2.0,I got the black has very shiny elasticy type fabric that snags and holds onto lint. Just got as a cheap workout pant. Not bad but not as comfortable as I was hoping.
2.0,"Bought this less than a month ago and they are falling apart. The soles have eroded so much in less than 30 days, that they have holes now all the way through. Mind you, my child didn’t wear them every day. I did like the softness of the leather."
2.0,Fun if you like knots.
2.0,"Very flimsy, broke 2nd day, case pops off throughout the day. Very annoying"
2.0,disappointed in color.  picture shows deep red and they are almost clear
2.0,The size says 10 but the fit like a size 9.<br />I love the style
2.0,"The size was perfect, however, I did not like the fabric/material that the dress was made from.  I ended up returning it."
2.0,"The swimsuit is cute.  However, there are metal rings that connect the back of the bathing suit and the straps.  These rings rubbed red spots on my daughter and she complained about it being sore.  I’m going to have to see if I can remove the rings and sew the straps directly to the suit which is a pain because I don’t sew well.  Poor design."
2.0,Don't waste your money on this bracelet.  The painted designs were poorly executed.
2.0,I was excited to get this beautiful necklace but it broke literally five minutes into wearing first the first time when I wanted to see how it looks on. The piece that broke was melted on to another piece so it's not like I can just get a new ring to reconnect it. I'm so disappointed because this necklace was what I needed but now I can't wear it's beyond repair.
2.0,"The product is comfortable. fuzzy inside and outside. But it is shipped from china, so the quality is poor as expected.  The color on the picture looks DARKER than the actual Grey in the picture. I expected the Darker colored grey shown in the picture which was MISLEADING. Overall Comfortable and warm. But the pockets are poorly made and make your hips looks bigger. otherwise it is ok."
2.0,I love the shape of these sunglasses but they have a very strong odor which game me a headache so I don't wear them. Oh well!
2.0,They fit well and look nice. Only problem is that they’re SEE THROUGH when they get wet. People on the boat didn’t enjoy the “frank and beans show” when I came out of the water. Had to throw them away. Waste of money!
2.0,Not the kind of tank top you want if you need something that doesn't ride up as much. They ripped super easily even from half a year's use of the correct size. They're also uglier than the photos...
2.0,"I don't like them. They are way too soft. if you like that, i guess you'd like it."
2.0,Shirt is see through on the sides.  One of the straps is sewn awkwardly. Meaning it is half the size of the other strap. Super itchy and rough.  you can chance it if you want but i wouldn't if i were you.
2.0,Would have been better if it also had bookbag straps.When my 3 year old didn't feel like pushing it thru the airport I had to carry it by the long handle.
2.0,"I think these are so so cute, but they didn't hang at the same angle, so it looked kind of weird. Also they are very heavy and broke after the first couple of times I wore them. :("
2.0,Did not like these. Did not fit around my ankle the way I thought they would.
2.0,this item cracked to easily and broke with the first dropped
2.0,Doesn't fit right and soooo uncomfortable.
2.0,I knew for the price I might not get the best quality. The metal irritates my ears and they started bleeding so I had to stop wearing them. Out of all of the designs only 4 were that I really like and didn’t look cheap.
2.0,One button hole does not line up with the button.
2.0,"This bathing suit was ill-fitting because the cut was bad and the materials were cheap. Pattern only on one side of the fabric so when the rug goes move you see white. If you want to look like you are wearing cheap, poorly fitting swimsuit then enjoy.<br />Not well designed at all. I’ve always worn high quality swimsuits and now I know why they cost more. Better design, better construction. This suit was made cheaply and looked cheap on."
2.0,Nice look and feel but screw fell out of ear piece and unable to find one which fits it.
2.0,Looks sexy in the photo. Looks dowdy in real life.
2.0,the first day my husband wore this band the silver pop out and we were not able to repair it.
2.0,"I really wanted these to be more comfortable. However, the tie is fake, so there's no drawstring, and they almost fall off of me, so size down if you do get them. The fabric seems cheap and isn't as soft as I thought they would be. Overall there just okay..."
2.0,I ordered these because of the good reviews however upon recieving them I tried them on to ensure they fit only to have the straps on the tan one come unsewn from such poor quality the minute I put it on. Good thing I have a sewing machince and can fix myself. Not impressed.
2.0,"Print is nice, fit is true to size but the quality is cheap and flimsy like lining fabric and hard against the skin. I returned it"
2.0,They look nothing like the picture. Disappointed.
2.0,"I bought these for a long flight from the States to New Zealand. I had to take them off after 2 hours--- the polka dots have seams on the inside with at least 1cm of fabric around every single dot. I peeled them off and looked like a leper! My legs were covered in skin-indented polka dots and it took several hours for me to rub/walk to get the blood flow back and the dot indentions to go away. As others have mentioned, they are very tall and do come well over the knee (I'm 5'4), but I actually liked that as most tall socks I find are too short. Unfortunately, because of the poor design, I won't be wearing these again (unless my socks will 100% be hidden and I can wear them inside out). However, my husband got the solid black ones and loved his. Bummer, because the polka dots are adorable... just poorly designed!"
2.0,Arch too high. Had to remove insole.
2.0,"This item was not received as pictured, the red color looked like a pink."
2.0,A 16th birthday gift
2.0,This bag is not leather.  There is a test anyone can do for greased leather.  a scratch with your fingernail will leave a mark on greased leather.<br />But the bag is well made.  I'm returning it because I don't use vinyl.
2.0,This is shapeless and baggie and see through. I do not personally care for it. It wasn't expensive so I may wear it occasionally
2.0,"I would have given 5 stars because the ones that work are awesome.  However, at least a fourth of the lights in the package are either broken or just plain don't work.  I am very disappointed at the quality."
2.0,product material  is ridiculously thin!!!
2.0,Made of cheap material.  I might wear it to bed.  The colors don't look nearly as nice as they do in the picture.
2.0,"I was expecting a RAINCOAT. To put it simply, this comes labeled as a poncho. So that should tell you enough right there.  I originally thought that I had received the wrong item. I did not. It does look like the picture but it feels like a poncho. This will not keep you dry for longer than about 5-10 minutes if you are lucky. It does fold up into a small jacket which would be nice to keep with you if you need something just to have at all times. The reflectors on the jacket are nice, but not really needed. I would not buy this jacket."
2.0,"The material feels good to touch.<br />However, it is a bit big for my head. I can’t remember if there was a size chart or not so if you decide to purchase please refer to it.<br />I didn’t return the item as my plan is to give it to my nephew."
2.0,"These are fine but if I hadn't already taken all the tags off before putting them on, I would have returned them without a doubt. They run slightly small so I'm not as comfortable in my usual size and the waistband rolls down constantly, at the slightest bend in the waist. The material is pretty thin so I'm not sure this would change going up a size."
2.0,"The first thing I noticed was how shallow the pocket was. Honestly, the width of the frog is pretty good, but it’s shaped like a taco. It’s not deep at all. Now that doesn’t mean it won’t hold money, it’s not a bad size for that if that’s what you wanted it for, but it won’t hold your cards or really anything other than some coins and folded bills.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was the headband was way smaller than I thought it would be. I guess I could’ve checked the dimensions in the listing, but it’s not the normal size. Good thing is I was gonna wear it on my arm for Halloween, so no big deal.<br /><br />Third, and definitely the most important issue, is the metal clasp part is rusting and the finish is peeling off. I used a q-tip and alcohol on it before it took the picture, so it looked more rusty at first. This is unacceptable, and I may ask for a replacement."
2.0,"Cute shoe but the buckle is very weird. Instead of being a real buckle, or a faux buckle with Velcro fastener, this shoes closes by looping a hook across the strap and over the top of the buckle. If the strap pushes forward though it could easily release since the hook is not all the way closed. It is weird. My daughter couldn't figure it out. It took me a while to figure out how to close it. If my daughter needs help at school it would take another adult a while to figure it out, too. I sent them back."
2.0,"This was comedically small on me. Or maybe I’m just way less cute than the model. In any event, I ended up giving the two I bought to my 13-year-old stepdaughter who will undoubtedly get a lot more use out of them that I ever would."
2.0,I got these thinking they would be amazing but the are shaped a bit odd and didn't seem to be super high quality.
2.0,"UPDATED***<br /><br />ZANZEA Women's One Off Shoulder Striped Irregular Long Maxi Dress Loose Kaftan.<br /><br />I Purchase this dress Because I it looked really nice on the person wearing it in the photo. When I received this dress a few days ago, I was really disappointed.<br /><br />I wear size a 16 and XL-2XL is shirts. I thought this dress would fit great but I was totally wrong. This dress was way bigger then it was doscribed. I honestly thought that this dress would look just like the photo. But, the Neckline looked more like an oval shape and the dress does not come off the shoulders just like it was shown in the photo. In the photo the slits looked like it was more in the front but on the dress I received its on the sides. This &#34;Irregular&#34; shaped dress is not Irregular and has no shape at all to it. Being a plus size girl I look for clothing that will make me look nice. This dress does the opposite of making me look nice. I really thought this would be a sexy dress, even my husband did not like this dress on me.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Lightweight feeling.<br />Soft and comfy material.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Too thin of a fabric.<br />Not a sexy dress at all.<br />Way bigger than I thought.<br />Not an Irregular shape dress.<br />The slit is on both sides not in the front.<br />The Neckline does not come off the should.<br /><br />***Please let me know why you do not believe my review is not helpful? Please do not click not helpful if you are just doing it to do it***<br /><br />Over ALL, I do not recommend this ZANZEA Women's One Off Shoulder Striped Irregular Long Maxi Dress Loose Kaftan because It does not resemble the dress the model is modeling in the photo and does not look sexy at all. The dress looks more like a night gown for an older women, not something a younger women would wear."
2.0,Smaller than in pic
2.0,"The dress was thin, and small. I ordered a plus size and it felt like a size x large"
2.0,Very cute but turned daughters fingers green
2.0,"Updated: Initially loved the band as it gave the watch a much better look.  Now after some time I have experienced the same issue as some others.  The band where it attaches to the watch has come apart.  O<br /><br />I love this band!  It compliments the style of the watch very well.  It was a little tough to get properly seated at first, but once locked in, it has never had another issue since."
2.0,"Stitching was already coming loose straight out of the package. The color is uneven: black dress has big, light, horizontal streaks. Might be passable at night, but pretty obvious in daylight.<br /><br />Too bad; it’s comfortable, flattering, and I really like the print. It fit as expected. I’m 5’3, 36(B)-28-38, and I ordered a medium. It had plenty room in the top (maybe could’ve gone with a small) and fell right above the floor when I was barefoot."
2.0,Hat was just a basic beanie with a Korn tag sewn to it. Not official at all.
2.0,Comfortable jacket but terrible zipper design.  Mine will separate from the bottom when it is fully zipped. Castle X was no real help to me in getting it reasonable resolved. I will not buy anything from this company again. Spend the extra money and buy Klim. You won't regret it.
2.0,This sweatshirt was much too small and too short. I was surprised at the fit since it was an XXL. I returned it.
2.0,They turned color after the first time I wore them to work.
2.0,The scarves looked like they were just cut fabric no structure.  One of the scarves had stains on it.  I waited a long time for them to come.
2.0,"This product is cute and comfortable, bonus points for its preppy look in a shorts set. Unfortunately, though, the modal fabric is too clingy in some places and I don’t enjoy wearing them. Maybe pre-baby I would have loved them, but post baby I do not."
2.0,"Wicked short and way too much cleavage, if you fix one, the other gets worse. Wish they had made the slit so my crotch wouldn't show.  I have to wear leggings...not the look I was going for."
2.0,"Style is cute.  However, these are not tall socks like soccer socks.  They do not cover the shin guards.  I bought based on looks and soccer socks.  Failed on the tall/long part."
2.0,The dress was way to short. I’m 5’3 and one wrong move in the dress and game over. I did love the sleeves of this dress. I’m not a very big person or tall at all. I have a large chest and my shoulder are a little on the broad side.
2.0,The holes for hands to go through are not big at all so you can only get your wrist through. I will not be reordering this product.
2.0,"The zippers suck, the strap ripped, the quality is not good. The size is good but thats about it."
2.0,Wore it maybe 4x and a hole tore open on the shoulder seem. Low Quality
2.0,Material for this dress is very thin & poorly made. Not at all like the picture or wht was expected. Fit was also too large eventhough I used the size chart
2.0,"I am a size 8 and these are extremely tight on my feet. I always end up with those big, slightly painful creases in the backs of my feet after wearing these for a few hours."
2.0,"I expected them to have a curl as in the photo, but they are completely flat. I understand they are handmade and each is different, but flat just isn't as pretty."
2.0,"Okay, so I had this Casio watch (or at least a version of it), a few years ago, and it was just as I remember it.<br />The only issue I have is that it is small. Like a ladies watch small, and I have skinny wrists. Anyway, if your like me and appreciate retro things you cant go wrong with this awesome watch. Go ahead impress your friends!"
2.0,Runs way too small compared to sizing info
2.0,"There is a misunderstanding here.  This loupe is 10x.  It appears to be a 30mmx21mm 10x loupe.  I just put it right next to my 10x loupe on a piece of paper and my 10x loupe magnifies it larger because the loupe is deeper (deeper than 21MM I guess).  This is not a 30X loupe though, so do not buy it expecting 30x.  It is 10x."
2.0,This dress is almost completely see through! It is super thin fabric and has ZERO shield from any glimmer of light. The straps are not adjustable either. I am 135 lbs and 5'4 and the small was too big. I will be returning. I only gave it 2 stars because I like the print...
2.0,"The Product Details indicated the presence of an LR44 battery, leading me to think this watch was battery powered. However the owners manual that came with it states that it's an ""Automatic"" self-winding watch, which is certainly not what I ordered.  I've posted a question to find out which is true. The model # on the back is 6898G, which is similar but not an exact match to the model number of SC-6898 that's listed in the description, so perhaps I received a different model?  And finally, the photo in the description showed all black text day and date display.  My watch came with a red text day display.  If this turns out to be an Automatic watch, I'll most certainly be returning it.<br /><br />Following up on my review above after receiving a response to my question and being told that the ""6898 model it is a quartz watches"".  This indirect answer infers that the watch is battery powered and that I simply received the wrong owner's manual.  In addition, upon setting the day/date I realized that only Sun is shown in red text.  Other answered questions under a differenet listing for the same watch on Amazon (where there are a lot of answered questions and reviews under the other listing) indicate that replacing the battery must be done by a professional.  I have a watch battery replacement kit but don't see the grooves on the back of the watch that wold be needed to open it as I've opened other watches.  Obviously it's not worth paying a jeweler $25 to replace the battery on a $30 watch so it appears the watch may be useless after its initial battery dies if I can't find a way to open it and replace the battery myself.  I remain very disappointed in this purchase."
2.0,"The lighter portion of the bow is gold, like wire material. I did not like this, but the rest is cute. The price was great ($4.99) and with this coming from a China, didn't return it because it would cost more for shipping. I don't think the faux leather portion will hold up long, since it's the same material I have wedge sandals made out of and the plasticky portion rubs off with time.<br /><br />If you're looking for a cheap, camel color belt that will only be worn a few times, this one would be perfect."
2.0,"The glasses themselves work fine but the strap holding them together is way too small.  These are so tight it feels like wearing swimming goggles.  Unfortunately, without a proper fit, these are useless. It might be helpful if they gave measurements so you could get an idea about how they might fit."
2.0,"Sloppy construction (see photo) and rougher polyester fabric which maybe better suited for cool weather.<br />Only one side of the elastic was properly sewn down onto the side of the zipper. After I took the effort to get the run-on thread out of the zipper, dress fit fine and offers a slim look. However, I can see this dress being a challenge for those who are short or top-heavy as the dress has a longer cut and doesn't offer much coverage around the bust.<br />Per the description, not a true wrap dress. The dress has a zipper enclosure in the back and comes with a separate belt."
2.0,Not really that great. It's going in the costume box as a backup.
2.0,hole for your face is too small and material is real thin. will keep you warm unless the wind is blowing.
2.0,Haven't had it a month and the strap buckle broke! Very cute and great in size
2.0,"I adored this necklace.  The picture here on amazon does it no justice.  The pendant is small, but I prefer smaller pendant necklaces.  This necklace shines and moves.  I was in love with the gorgeous piece of jewelry, however the chain popped on the first day that I wore it.  I do not recommend this necklace."
2.0,So I got a small for my 5 year old and it was way to big. Y'all should put a sizing chart up to help parents get a better idea on sizing.
2.0,Fitness was about a 2x
2.0,"I like the pattern.<br />Fit is a little odd for me. The crotch area is loose enough, but they are snug in the upper thigh which makes for more of a bulge effect."
2.0,"These boots fit great and are very cute, but the zipper broke after one month (just past the date available to return). There is no stopper for the zipper at the top so it came right off the track. Fixed it once but it broke again the next day. Such a waste of money. They could be great boots if they fixed this design flaw."
2.0,The picture of the shirt. didn't meet 😕 the standards of what was advertised.
2.0,"Just got this watch on Sunday. Started wearing it today. Seems ok for the price. Looks really nice, but bezel is a click off when trying align it with 12 o’clock. Date in window also off. The band seems to have micro adjustments, but can’t figure out how to adjust it. Setting time is very sensitive. You pull the crown out, adjust the time and when you push the crown back in, minute hand moves. You have to do it really slow."
2.0,The quality of the dress is good.. but the size runs large.. size S is still loose for me.. I am not as thin as the model shown above but still the dress is large for me.. it may suit the taller person
2.0,The zippers edges are rough and scratches against the fabric and messes it up fast.
2.0,I loved this dress but unfortunately it fell apart in the wash....I'm so upset! :/
2.0,I don't know how they found a model with that big of a behind that could fit in this dress. The largest size only goes up to 10-12. And that was a much curvier look on the model.
2.0,"The packaging of this robe was a disappointment. The robe was stuffed into a box with no wrapping.  I expected that it would be, at least, in a plastic bag before it was placed in a box.  The robe is ok, but the belt greatly disappointed me. There were several stray threads on it and it was not properly sewn at the ends..  Also, the belt is clearly in two pieces sewn together as seen in the picture.  I feel this is poor workmanship and cheapens the look of the robe.  Had I known the belt would look like this I would NOT have purchased the robe.  I am wondering how long the belt will last.<br /><br />It is not worth my time and effort to repackage the robe and return it.  I am very disappointed."
2.0,It fits haven't wear it out as yet though
2.0,It's just a cheap iron on.
2.0,"*Warning, honest first impression...* I recieved this purse today. I've never smelled a purse that flat out stinks!! I regret opening the package indoors because the smell was THAT BAD, to the point the cardboard box stunk. I put the purse outside. Box in the trash. I'm hoping if it air outs for a day or so, maybe the scent will go away? Otherwise, I'm returning this piece of sh*t. How someone can put a product out there and have these results I'd beyond me? Purse looks cute but the scent makes it not worthy of keeping.  I'll update in a day or so... Update: I left the purse outside for three days to air out. I don't know what to say. A product shouldn't stink so damn much. It's a nice purse now, can't detect the scent. But I don't think I'd repurchase. Smelled like chemical and fish."
2.0,"Description says high waist but I found these to fit too short in the crotch. I have a long torso so these may fit differently for someone who is short waisted. The material holds static very easily, the more you move the more it clings to your legs and every piece of lint will stick to them. I actually heard the crackling of static as I took them out of the packaging. I can't stand it, will be returning. They also have a high sheen to them that reminds me of pajamas. They fit like them too, sloppy with no real structure. They seem to be sewn descently but that's the only positive I can find. Fyi these have no stretch."
2.0,The fabric balls before you wash these once.
2.0,Cheap material; too snug of a fit even if you purchase one size up.  Not classy at all.
2.0,The yellow is definitely not bright as in the picture- more of a gold. Fits big. The arms are not like the picture either- strap part is wider. It's just sort of blah and dumpy to me. Definitely not impressed. The pockets were the only great thing about this dress.
2.0,They need to extend further on either side as you still need to turn your head by 40% to see what is behind you …thus making it difficult to walk forward if your head is slanted to the side.  Rather defeats the idea !
2.0,In less than a week the grip came off of glove and a month later it ripped open over my pointer finger
2.0,"Some of the clips had sharp edges on the metal tensioner, so I couldn't give out all clips from the set as gifts. I was worried that I'd cause my friends to snag their ties or shirts. Additionally, the metal sides are somewhat flimsy, which can make the clips bend and twist out of alignment."
2.0,I liked the blue color tint and the rubber arms but they fogged and scratched
2.0,I have to send it back. There is a 1&#34; hole along the shoulder and I'm not enough of a seamstress to fix it.  I have one in black and that was great.
2.0,The material is super stiff and doesn't naturally lay on your body. Lots of loose threads along stitching that weren't properly sewn in. Cheaply made
2.0,Looks nice - but didn’t work from the time I first put it on.
2.0,Not a cool as it looks.
2.0,Cheap materials. Could’ve done better making these myself.
2.0,"too large, bad shape."
2.0,Like the color but really shows dirt and very hard to clean use soap and water still will not clean.
2.0,bought this for my wife cause it thought it was like a made garment for this turns out its just a sew up kids baseball 3/4 sleeve shirt with a pocket in the neck. after we saw this we went and bought a cuople of these shirts and voala same thing...
2.0,It runs very small and tight fitting.
2.0,"Much more blue than expected. I expected black. The bottom hem unraveled even before the first wash. But maybe this is a freak, since I have purchased other parsley & sage tunics before and they were great."
2.0,The fabric is too bright.  It is an eyesore.
2.0,"I wear a 48I, so was hesitant to purchase this.  I'd read several reviews about how it fit well for larger busted women, I went ahead and bought the 3x.<br /><br />The band fits well around my chest.  However the bands that cover my breasts mash then down more than the pictures show.<br /><br />I'm going to have a friend help me with it, to see if there is any way to make it work as I wanted it to, but chances are I'm just going to have to return it and be disappointed..."
2.0,"The lower case ""t"" is perfect very stylish. Unfortunately the capital ""T"" constantly flips upside down because of the placement of the chain."
2.0,They are exactly what I ordered but I’m a thick legged guy. They do not fit my legs right at all. I could really probably use a large when I typically wear a medium in hanes
2.0,I like the looks and the construction is fine. If the zippers were longer this would be pretty good. As it is the openings on the zippered areas are almost impossible to get my hand in. Also the pocket on the back only goes down about half way. I expected it to be close to as deep as the purse. I gave up and gave it to my grand daughter who is 9.
2.0,The patches weren't even on the elbows but it fits fine
2.0,they are too big
2.0,"Too small for my big boy!. I brought the size L, but it’s still small!."
2.0,very pretty but ended up giving it for one of my bridesmaids!
2.0,"Same as the other reviewers, only got ONE hat. Don’t really care as the price was cheap enough and the quality is decent, but BUYER BEWARE: you do NOT get two hats AS ADVERTISED."
2.0,Plan on wearing socks or the shoe will begin to smell bad quick!  Happened with about 10 wearings.
2.0,The black fabric dyes your skin! Otherwise the outfit is cute!
2.0,Did not like fit!
2.0,"nice style but to thin, able to see through"
2.0,Runs really small. Ordered XL fits like small
2.0,Was a little wrinkled and looked like it had been washed. I thought I was buying a new one!
2.0,"I'm not a big fan of this scarf. It is huge! I really can't wear it as a scarf, I use it more as a blanket. Way too bulky to wear around neck. Also, the color is very different than the picture, it's red, blue and yellow- hard to match with outfits."
2.0,the material is ment to be Rayon I dont think it is
2.0,Sizes are smaller than usual. Order one size bigger than u need. Made cheaply
2.0,This is for skinny women. If you're thick don't get it.
2.0,Unfortunately I'm not completely satisfied with this shirt. The graphic print is pixelated kind of has a blur to it. I have a long torso and the shirt comes short so I keep pull it down. Thirdly it doesn't really fit around the neck to well. The neck area of the shirt fits low like how a woman's shirt would.
2.0,Looks weird and doesn't lay like the listing photo shows.<br />Just meh. Not sure if my husband will wear it.
2.0,"Was very cheap looking in person. VERY small. Probably good for a size 4-6 MAYBE 8, but definitely would help to have more sizing details with this product."
2.0,"This shirt was a very large full cut shirt, that needed ironing anytime you put it on. My wife is now wearing it as a nightgown!"
2.0,"Not as pictured, baggy in odd places, and the sleeves are boxy. I ordered the ""green"" which I thought would be more of a turquoise but it is very blue in person. The whole shape is really square and not slouchy in the way I'd hoped. Overall not very impressed and will return. I ordered the small and am 5'5"" 140lbs."
2.0,For a grandmother perhaps.<br />Very large and Gotti
2.0,"This is a cute, easy dress, but it's not going to last.<br /><br />1) The fabric pills very quickly.<br />2) After *2* wears, it looks as if it's been worn for a year.<br />3) It stains very easily -- seemingly more than other similar fabrics.<br />4) Because of the weight of the fabric, it quickly is going to look more like a nightgown than a simple dress."
2.0,"This sports bra fit as expect however it was not high impact. I bought it for a workout program that involves a lot of jumping jacks, it didnt hold me down at all. It was complicated to put on as well. I wouldn't waste your money if you have a larger chest."
2.0,I had hoped this would fit
2.0,"Returning this shirt. Item description says it's a cotton blend, nowhere is it actually listed on any tag as to fabric content and it feels more like a polyester blend( more polyester than cotton). It's extremely scratchy and rough to the touch. Not very comfortable on the skin."
2.0,"Difficult to put together, as no instructions included, and it's not intuitive.  I liked the fit, but my husband said it was not comfortable for him.  We were not going to be able to use them, so I had to return them.  YMMV."
2.0,This product seriously let me down at the worst of times. It worked well while it worked and the closing mechanism was fantastic. Though I was extremely upset when my umbrella sheared in half near the top of the shaft in the middle of torrential rainfall. Either this umbrella is made of poor materials or I got a defective one. I do not recommend for fear that it may break for others too.
2.0,es de plastico deberian aclararlo
2.0,"Thought this was cute initially, but it stretched out as I wore it.  Did not maintain shape at all.  Not flattering.  Returned easily, no hassle, for credit."
2.0,at one point you could buy all 5 of these unique nose rings for $14.99.. all 5! Each one differently compared to the next. I purchased at least 3-4 times. Now you can only purchase them individually at $17.99 now! Wow 😳 $14.99 for all 5.. to $17.99 for just one ☝🏽 let that sink in..
2.0,"Not a fan of the color. It's not flattering. Since these are denser than regular pantyhose you buy at a Walgreens, they look weird. I prefer my transparent ones which are a lot cheaper too."
2.0,Not true to size. Very thin. Not worth the time
2.0,This is not an XL. It should be classified as X-Small. It's VERY small!!
2.0,[[VIDEOID:5f512554db94fd12748321aa5b56c33b]] I am a 5’9 Curvey female who fits a medium and large . I had ordered a large but it’s more so a small . If it did fit this would be soooo cute . Maybe a little high waters but some uggs would fix it . It’s right around the arms and thighs .
2.0,sizing is all wrong
2.0,Fit great. But was delivered with some strange stain on the back. Can't return... But if I could I would.
2.0,"The skirt looks nothing like the picture, it fits really loosely and fabric is awful. I can't send it back because I'm in Jamaica and will have to pay to ship it so I guess I will just have to throw it away...I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase."
2.0,Too small actually!
2.0,One earing came damage. So returned it back. But the model was so good. Liked the design.
2.0,"Got a hole in the crotch almost immediately, they're super thin and extremely fragile. But I mean, the print was nice. The blue stripe has issues sticking to itself, though."
2.0,"My stuff fit perfectly, even room for more. I zipped and u zipped it about 3 times and the zipper separated. Even after unzipping all the way, and re zipping, it continues to split in the same place.  I’m not returning it because my old wallet is no longer usable. I’ll have to fix a new zipper myself. Otherwise seems fine."
2.0,Very small and I can usually wear smalls.
2.0,The dress is nice but it didn't fit like I expect
2.0,The material seems cheap and is not very giving and they were too small.
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture.. too big and boxy in shoulder area....
2.0,"Overall the dress was really cute , however It had spots all over the yellow on the dress will return"
2.0,"Got the costume for a Halloween party this year. The shorts were nothing like what I expected (too poofy overall). The vest was horrible. I tried it on once and the zipper broke. The belt, gun holsters, and fake guns on the other hand were awesome. They were the only parts I used for my costume. Overall, it wasn't worth it. You could make a costume by yourself for cheaper."
2.0,It looks good yeah..  but that thing smelled like eggs... it was gross
2.0,I order a white version of the same shoe from a different seller and is true to size these are the same size and too wide and long and not as advertised the bottom is not slip resistant it is not a rubber sole !!!
2.0,Too tight.<br />Retuned it.<br />But the quality was nice.
2.0,To long and too heavy
2.0,Loved it but didnt fit its way too small
2.0,I just wore this item for the first time and the pockets have already started coming off. Totally not worth the money
2.0,"Both pairs that I ordered have either blemishes/scratches on the left lens. What’s ironic is they both have it almost at the same exact spot on the lens. I did not return them as I really needed a pair of these type of glasses, didn’t want to return and wait for another pair. Wouldn’t purchase this brand again, not recommended!  I guess you get what you pay for, price was decent."
2.0,"I ordered this bead because I liked the multicolor opal crystals on it, but when it arrived the colors are all washed out and you really cannot even see the color crystals. It fit my Pandora bracelet and would have been great if I wanted a more clear crystal bead, but I didn't, so this one had to be returned. The return process was super easy so that helps."
2.0,"Just got my necklace yesterday and didnt notice till i put it on and my fiance told me it was messing a jewel in the middle , when it came it they justo threw it inside a placstic bag not closed por anything ."
2.0,The bumblebees are cute but the hoops themselves are cheap. They posts will bend when you're simply putting the earring backs on.  I enjoyed ditching the hoops and attaching the bumblebee to other earning sets.
2.0,Did not fit my phone..lesson learnec
2.0,Strap still slides. Doesn’t hold well
2.0,I ordered the pink and it is see through thin.  Very disappointed as the fit was nice and the fabric was very soft.
2.0,"I loved the style of these earrings and the color. However, almost every pair only lasted through wearing them once. The ball of the earring came apart and I had to super glue them back on. Some pies the gems fell off just as quickly. Would like a refund but my return window has already closed."
2.0,"The belt is way too small. It's in no way anywhere near a medium or large. It's more like a small. It's pretty. But since I can't wear it, I have no use for it. $15.00 wasted. I have purchased many items on Amazon, but this is the first item I've purchased on Amazon that I have been unhappy with.  :("
2.0,Sheer fabric
2.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend and the first time she put it on the clasp broke. It's cute, but very cheaply made."
2.0,Materials feel cheap and they do not feel comfortable against my skin
2.0,Material is very cheap; it feels like windbreaker material. The dress overall is not well made. There is a lot of extra fabric on the sides of the bodice. But at least the wings are cute. I’ll probably remove them and sew them onto something else.
2.0,"Very, very small. I bought this for my 7 year old but it is so small my 4 year old is using it. Otherwise it's ok. Love the pattern. Sort of thin material."
2.0,"Bought an XXL because of what their size chart said. This seemed odd to me, considering I am a large in most other clothes. But I bought the XXL anyway. I should have gone with a large because this is far too big!"
2.0,"I ordered and received a size large which, going by the sizing chart should have been right. It was waaaaayyyyyy too small. Im surprised I was able to get it on and off without tearing it.<br /><br />The lace was not stretchy in the band either which did not help.<br /><br />Not a do again for me"
2.0,"Super cute dress, wish they would’ve used a different fabric for it though..."
2.0,"I wanted these shoes to work, but only after a couple of times of wear they were falling apart."
2.0,The fabric is good quality but it has texture there are a few strings that haven't been cut and the zipper is small and hard to pull over the band plus it's not pleated in the back
2.0,"These look really cute for babies but they run a little large, I got size XS for my 11 months old baby but still look too big for her."
2.0,"Not thrilled with this one, unfortunately.  I am pregnant but still wearing a C cup, so I figured jumping up to D should do the trick.  Instead I'm left with a cup that doesn't cover my areolas, even the lace at the top isn't enough to cover them.  I have side boob and the underwire pokes me everywhere.  The image shows a bra where the cup goes up almost to the armpit, but that simply isn't the case here and the coverage is minimal.  The reason it's a pushup?  There isn't enough room for it not to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, the band is long enough and the color is gorgeous.  Also I realized after the fact that the bra I ordered is not hte one I thought I had ordered (I wanted the one with more lace at the bottom, so pay attention!)"
2.0,Unfortunately this dress does not fit as it shows in the picture on the model. Very stiff and uncomfortable. The company was very easy to worth it about the return though.
2.0,I like the style of the boot . The string's aglet came off one of the laces a week or so into wearing it. also a small decorative rivet on a loop on the back of the boot came free very quickly. Overall I am happy with the boots as they are wearing pretty well otherwise.<br /><br />UPDATE: The sole of the boot is coming off on the side where the boot bends as you walk.  Very disappointed!!!!
2.0,"This arrived looking exactly how it looked in the photo. However, I didn't expect it to look so obviously cheap. The combination of this particular leather (the colour of the leather specifically), and the shiny chrome hardware (as opposed to bead-blasted or matte hardware that you find on other straps) made this look as cheap as it was inexpensive. I ended up returning it and spending quite a bit more on a new strap that arrives today."
2.0,These were way too big for my toddler. So I returned them.
2.0,Seems Sturdy material classic look but cheap if  you need a bag this will do.  I don't know if it will last long thought would not recommend first day taking the purse out and I noticed that some strands are already coming undone on the bottom of the purse first day out with the purse just got it yesterday and I'm already noticing strands coming undone at the bottom of the purse I haven't even put anything in here yet
2.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; and these leggings are loooooong!  Also need to pull up super high on my ribcage and just can't get them to be comfortable.  They are very soft and but tore easily when I wore them for the first time, and not at a seam."
2.0,Color is MUCH lighter than pictured. Will probably return for darker blue.
2.0,"Warmer than dress socks, but not thick-warm-fuzzy winter-with-pajamas socks. They also shed a ton of little white fuzzies the first couple of times you wash them, and the elastic starts to unravel the first time you wear them."
2.0,I am changing my review because after the wash I am not happy with my purchase
2.0,These are easy to heavy for your ears to wear!
2.0,Wooden ends need to be attached better. They keep falling off!!
2.0,"I wear a size 7 shoe so not tiny and these socks feel like they are for giants. I don’t understand how they’re women’s socks, and they aren’t very soft."
2.0,Disappointed that these are actually NOT cotton or Made in USA as stated. See my attached pic of tag. They do feel soft and fit well.
2.0,Cheap material. The hat didn't fit my head or my friends. For people with small heads.
2.0,I love the band and the pattern and color however as you can see it is flawed and looks bad when you wear it.<br />A little disappointed that the item sent was damaged/flawed.
2.0,"Item looked just like it does on website. however, I ordered a medium and received an XL."
2.0,"The charms are exaggerated in the advertisement. They are actually very small. I have other similar bracelets I bought from Target for $20 and as the pictures show, the charms on those bracelets are almost double the size of these charms. An absolute let down."
2.0,It’s ok not great just ok
2.0,"Purchased it in black and loved it, wore the black ones out and got so many complements.  These are not even the same cut/style as the black.  Way smaller and unable to wear.  So just be warned.  I'm disappointed for sure."
2.0,De la cintura muy pequeña
2.0,"Very pretty ring but the first time wearing it, the coating started coming off the back of it."
2.0,"The Flex FlexFit hats were not the Wool Good Quality hats that I had expected, and one of the Hats had a permanent dent in it from the way it was shipped"
2.0,"This was a disappointment. I thought it was suppose to be an nice sweater dress. But it was too thin and not long. I am average height and it was like a shirt and the sleeves were short as well. This dress was not flattering at all. The color is amazing, but a huge disappointment."
2.0,Nice Bag an exact replica of Michael Kors version<br />but took small for my needs
2.0,"Don't like how the arms fit, sleeves go part way down the arm. Sweater is shorter then it shows in the picture."
2.0,"Nobody in the history of ever has a torso long enough for this nonsense. I bought a med and a large thinking maybe I just got the wrong size the first time. Nope. You could poke arm holes in the ""high waist"" and wear it as a jumper. Good lawrdt!"
2.0,"I put them on as soon as I got them and made the mistake of throwing out the packaging. First of all, the hem of my jeans kept getting caught inside that tab in the back so I kept having to pull it out every time I stood up. Then, the chain had broken by the time I got home from work. (I patched it myself.)"
2.0,Love the shirt runs very small though
2.0,"I am giving this a 2 star overall rating!  The sleeves are very comfortable, provide sun protection and are very light weight.  BUT! They frayed too easily.  After one wearing I had thread coming off the sleeves.  I used them for golf and it is distracting to see thread blowing in the wind when you are putting.<br />I will not be buying these again."
2.0,"Shirt was way too large. Had to return. Also, the fabric was very lightweight. Would prefer shirt to button up to the neck. Has open collar neckline."
2.0,"Wow. I couldn't believe how short this suit was! I'm 5'1, 190 lbs, and I ordered based on the sizing chart. It should have fit fine, right? Well, when the suit came in I raced to the bathroom to try it on. It literally wouldn't come up far enough to cover the girls. Was this suit meant for a 10-year-old girl or a woman with curves? It's a great price if you're just looking for a suit bottom, but don't expect it to cover you up top. Very disappointing, because the pictures make it look like a great suit. And so the search continues...."
2.0,It shows a plus size model. I’m a large. I bought an extra large just to be safe. It fit maybe like a small/medium. I couldn’t even get it on.
2.0,Literally soooo see through!!!
2.0,"I love headbands, and I'm constantly on the search for ones that work for me. I do circuit training, and I run. Also, I have short, fine hair that is very slippery. When this headband arrived, it wasn't what I expected. Most yoga headbands that I have are wide, but come together at the back to make it easy to fold it to a smaller width. This one is wide all the way around. I decided to fold it in half and try to wear it that way for my run. Less than 3 minutes into my run, it had already slid off my head. I then opened it up and wore it at its fullest width. It didn't slip as much, but it was way too hot! The material is kind of scratchy and thicker than other headbands I own. I ended up taking it off and exchanging it with another headband I brought on my run just in case. Perhaps this would work better for just yoga, but it didn't work for me. Also, someone with thick hair may have better luck. All in all, I would look elsewhere if you want a nonslip, comfortable headband.<br /><br />*This product was purchased at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
2.0,"Product not as described but for the price, going to give it to my little sister. Took over 3 months to receive."
2.0,"This dress is not like the picture at all.  It's much longer than it looks in the image and the skirt is super, super poofy.  I felt like Marie Antoinette with the huge hoop skirts."
2.0,I bought it as a Christmas gift and it was too small
2.0,These earrings are tiny- they would fit a child better than an adult.  The moissanite stone is just a tad better than cubic zirconia.  The big problem is the setting - the “wire”<br />that goes into the ear piercing (sorry don’t know the technical term) is literally a flimsy wire (easy to accidentally bend just by taking it off and on- and so small I’m not sure it will fit a non-petite adult);  I suggest buying something else.
2.0,has wrinkles and the little band slides up
2.0,"I was expecting sweet, unfortunately it tasted more like cheese! Not to my taste but came in a beautiful box."
2.0,Really liked this one. Simple and blended well with other charms
2.0,The suit gets big really fast. I've used it two times and the underwire has already poked a hole through the suit.
2.0,its ok.. the arms fit weird.
2.0,"The dress is pretty and is flattering. However, there were many loose strings from the sleeves indicating poor finishing. I ordered a size up from my normal small so I could wear as maternity dress and even so, felt the top of the dress was too narrow. I ended up returning it due to these issues."
2.0,I returned the garment. It was a thin flimsy knit which looked cheap and nasty. Did not look at all like the illustration.
2.0,I bought this for a Halloween costume for my son. It was worn twice for a couple hours to events before Halloween. The bowtie fell apart shortly into the 2nd time it was worn. I'm currently trying to salvage it enough to be used on Halloween. The suspenders have held up and are a good quality from what I can tell.
2.0,"It's a cute design, but it did not meet my expectations. I was supposed to receive a gold tone brooch, but it was silver. Also, and more importantly-the face of the brooch is too heavy for the flimsy pin on the back. The safety pin design needs to be re envisioned."
2.0,"The heart and stones are perfect. However, the script on the heart is illegible as it's very small and they misspelled a name. I contacted a local jewler and he could not repair the writing as it would destroy the item's finish. I working with him to figure out a solution as the shipping is ridiculous and it would not arrive in time for the gift."
2.0,much thinner material than I expected and although the fabric is beautiful it is MUCH smaller than the sizing chart indicated because I ordered a size up but probably should have ordered 3 sizes up
2.0,Cute little romper.  Except when she tried to put her hands in her pockets which we on her back side.
2.0,"I think they are adorable. But they are a little smaller in size than I expected. And the latch on them doesn’t really latch, so it’s too heavy to stay in. Lost stones real quick"
2.0,Not true to size. Super cute pattern but will need to wait until next year to wear.
2.0,Arrived broken in one of the bottom corners.
2.0,"Even when they are extended, they still short. When they are adjusted it causes my lens to move up and down my nose. Not what I was expecting."
2.0,It was too short I am 5’8
2.0,"I love the headwrap and it's beautiful, especially for the price, however the biggest downfall are these stickers that they put directly on the headwrap. I thought maybe they would be easy to remove, but no matter how I tried I couldn't get the sticker off rendering the headwrap useless. I wish they would just place the stickers on the plastic packaging that the scarf comes in. Because of this I won't be purchasing any more headwraps from this seller again."
2.0,"The top lacy part is cute but the bottom is of a See-through material that’s cut too boxy, which is unflattering.  There is no chance it flares/hangs heavy like the picture.  The picture makes it look more like an A-cut but it’s closer to a pillowcase.  Overall it’s not “horrible” but not cute enough to even hide with a denim jacket.  I’m returning it."
2.0,"Big Man Alert:  The body of the shirt fits ok, but the arms are for a small person.  Be aware!!!!"
2.0,This literally felt like it was made out of yarn. The quality was not worth the price.
2.0,Extremely thin silky material.
2.0,"Buttons are not real, just sewn on, waistline hit my ribcage, so it makes me look pregnant. Skirt nowhere near as full as pictured"
2.0,You exchail and the plastic is completely fogged up. Inhale and it clears. Bad design
2.0,"I don't like the front lining in this suit, it shows through, especially on the white side, looks bulky and like I'm wearing a pad.  The labeling on the side peels off easily."
2.0,"No like the picture, very bad quality"
2.0,"poor quality dont last long, started ripping after a few washes. BUt then again that could be my experience"
2.0,The knotted area had threads and stitching hanging out and is unfinished on one side. The knotted area doesn’t lay flat and it keeps flipping over to the unfinished  side while wearing it.
2.0,a lot of snaps either missing or came off after One wash
2.0,"Ordered a size or 2 up and it fit fine, it just wasn't flattering on my shape. Quality looked decent and it was a thicker material."
2.0,Was not as large as expected
2.0,Don't believe the overblown product description. It is just a simple/cheap and cheaply made little umbrella. For the money it's ok. But very flimsy and unlikely to hold to regular use. OK as an emergency umbrella to keep in your desk or glovebox.
2.0,"My packaging was damaged and the logo on the front looks like a 10 year old put it on and it's falling off/out of the fabric. It's soft, but that wasn't really the point. For $40 I expected much better."
2.0,"These were delivered on April 8,2022, by June 1,2022 the soles had split completely in half. They are really pretty but 2 months is not acceptable amount of time. Please see the pictures attached I added 2 stars because they were really nice and but the sole doesn’t make sense to break the way it did"
2.0,Just too small otherwise I lik very much. Bought the largest size they had. I wear a 20 because I prefer loose fitting clothing
2.0,Beeped every half hour.  Back light was dull. Military time every twelve hours.
2.0,"The fleece fits well, but the colors are not the same as pictured in the listing. The two stripes on each side, rather than being a darker gray accent, came as a much lighter gray which hurts the overall look of the fleece"
2.0,"It didn't have a bad look, I added fake blood on mine and it made it look really nice. But after wearing it for only a little bit it was really uncomfortable, I had to take it off periodically. Then I tripped and it landed a couple feet off of carpet and it broke."
2.0,Cute. It went right in but drying hair.. Came right out. The hinge doesn't hold it closed.
2.0,They were huge. I could tell they would have been great if they weren’t so big
2.0,"Super small and kind of see through. The material is strange. Pattern, though cool, is a rip off of someone else's art. :("
2.0,it’s definitely cute but<br />1. it’s made of tablecloth and/or tent material.<br />2. it wrinkles extremely fast.
2.0,The size was entirely too small. My 15 year old niece could not fit it and she wears a small .
2.0,"Cheap pressed pot metal. Since they are going to be used on handmade sweaters the clips wont detract from the sweaters so maybe I will keep them, but I don't recommend them!"
2.0,Battery died after a few weeks.
2.0,"If you’ve seen big mouth on Netflix - my boyfriend and I are being the hormone monsters. So I ordered this as part of my costume. It fits pretty small, (4’11, 114 lbs - I’m petite and it’s still tight on me). I originally got a small, so I ordered a medium expecting it to fit perfectly. There is absolutely no difference between the small and medium other than the tag inside that says (S) to (M). I’ve now ordered a THIRD that is a large - let’s see if this is actually any different than the other two. I’ve ever been large in anything in my life so if this doesn’t fit I’m at a loss. The quality is pretty good, it’s certainly not see through and the delivery time is great. I’ll  have to update about returns later and to see if the L is actually any larger 🙄 to be continued..."
2.0,"I wear a large hat, but this one did not fit the way I like them to. The snap brim is very small."
2.0,"They were definitely no-show when I wore them with my dress shoes. However, they did not stay secure after a short walk with them on. The elastic was not strong enough to keep the heel secured despite the gel grip within the heel of the sock."
2.0,I could not put this on because the ball made it impossible!!! I kept the wing and replaced the hoop with another snap hoops I order online...
2.0,Material did not have any stretch and could not it pull on enough to try. Ordered XL but it was not real XL fit.
2.0,not happy with this shirt at all; the fabric looks cheap and the M is actually S size; the sleeves were long so that's good but that's the only good thing about it
2.0,"Quality is not very good, it's pretty tight for medium size"
2.0,"Style: Grey Monochrome<br /><br />Lenses:The lenses have good clarity and seem to do their part pretty well as far as the sun coming in front of you. However, light reflection from the back (inside) of the lenses and into my eyes was a problem. This can be in part due to how the sunglasses fit on your face, but an interior anti-reflective coating would help with this.<br /><br />Frames: I like the visual cues of the frames, but the clear construction caused a lot of reflection to collect in the frames and ultimately project back into my eyes. I suspect this wouldn't be an issue with an opaque frame construction, but I would advise against the translucent frame styles.<br /><br />Overall:  For the price, I think the construction quality of the sunglasses is pretty great. However, the reflections I got in my eyes between the backward reflection on the lenses (sunlight coming from behind, bouncing off the inside of the lenses) and the light collection inside the frames ultimately made for the opposite intent for sunglasses. Part of this may be due to how the frames fit on my particular face (I have a high ridgeline in my nose). Ultimately, I decided to return them. If you want to try these out, I'd recommend the opaque/solid frame colors."
2.0,These socks are adorable but very thin. Our son wore the panda pair and before the end of the 1st day had a large hole in the toe area that was not caused by his nails. Weak sewing in that area apparently on that pair. We are hoping the other 2 will last but they are thinner than desired.
2.0,"Too small, if you have thighs, hips or butt be prepared to have a hard time getting them past that. Long crotch area, looks weird."
2.0,I'm happy I bought this at a deep discount. Less than $3. It's a completely different top from what I ordered. It kinda fits.....I guess the cut is weird. It will do for a pajama top or quick trip to Walmart 😉😉. That's about it. Would not order again. Would not recommend.
2.0,The fit was not flattering.. Never wore them.. May I return these?
2.0,I believe it was a childs size that was sold to me
2.0,Although the pattern and graphic style is incredibly cute I'm unhappy with product.  The way the shoe opening is and the non-stretchability in the fabric its VERY difficult to get a baby foot into the shoes.  I would've had to have bought them a size or two too large and then my babies foot would have fit into them without issue but they would have looked so large like clown shoes.
2.0,The dress is cute but it arrived very wrinkled and was challenging to get all the wrinkles out. It fit snugger than I expected.
2.0,It has a permanent golf in the brim!! I need a new hat by Saturday!!!!<br />HELP!!!!!!
2.0,"I am sending back as I typically wear a medium but the top is too small and the bottom is big. The fabric really isn't great either-very thin. I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I gave it a two because it isn't the worst thing, but for the money and my issues above I am sending it back. Rushing around to find another one before Halloween."
2.0,"I believe the sizes are for juniors; XL was very tight and short as I am 5'5"".<br />Also, the sweater had a strong chemical smell."
2.0,"Comfortable, but if you have any leg muscles at all, they will not fit properly. The circumference around the legs is uncomfortably tight. These are made in France... Are all French men built like this?<br />Seriously though, I  don't know who has legs this small...<br />Maybe if a dude consumes large amounts of soy and has sore nipples, these would probably fit fine, I imagine."
2.0,"Liked,but<br />A little short"
2.0,I really wanted to like it but I received a used wrinkly item. It was not in the packaging that is shown in the ad either. Returned and won’t recommend it.
2.0,"Well my raybans are sitting at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea... so there’s that. Good luck trying to fit your sunglasses in them, they’re only large enough for wire frames. The logo is also enormous.<br />It got 2 stars because I liked the print."
2.0,The hip area is cut smaller than the rest of pant. Looks weird.
2.0,It’s super cute and not the typical toddler outfit you’d find at your local clothing stores but it’s poorly made. The straps keep sliding down on my 2 year old but the pants fit her perfectly and I ordered a size up. She’s only worn it once and I’m already over it.
2.0,Not attractive at all . Hate it
2.0,"Much thinner than I expected. I can’t wear them with a shirt, maybe under a dress as underwear."
2.0,The hat came packed with a plastic form and the dome is fine but the brim is bent and I can't get it to unbend.
2.0,Perfect size. I've had It for a week and the gold plating had chipped off already. I will be returning
2.0,The collar is not as expected. It sits weird on my shoulders. It is soft but the color is also way faded compared to the pictures.
2.0,The dress did not fit as advertised. The dress stopped right under my butt. I got a 2X to be on the safe side but that didn’t work
2.0,"I did no like the material, very thin and the black has a shiny sheen.  The arms were very large on me.  I am going to return it."
2.0,They weren't really pearl colored as they used to be when they first came out.  They were just white plastic beads.
2.0,"I normally wear a 2X but this 2X was way too small for me. The white flowy part was a little below my navel so I cannot wear it with leggings. I'm 5'7 and weight around 220 lbs. The material is soft and thin which I like but again, very small. If I wash/dry this, it will probably be a size large I'm thinking."
2.0,"Bought for my girlfriend, came quickly which was nice and looks very good, just like the picture. After 2 times wearing it, some of the bands broke off. Had to take a pair of pliers to open the clasp that was holding the band, put the bands back in, then clamped down the piece of metal holding the band. Craftsmanship is lackluster at best. Does look nice though"
2.0,"I expected it to be a bit sturdier.  Also after 2 days of using it the zipper on 1 side broke, i was very dissappointed about that and the tassel broke off from the other zipper.  The snap does not snap."
2.0,Not a great size. Don’t go up to my knees
2.0,"They run very big, wish I would have known that before I got one."
2.0,It fits too small on my head. It doesn’t seem to be a standard size. The hat arrived mis-shapened. Idk If it is just the quality of the materials used or because the packaging was sub-par and it was smashed in transit. I do t like it.
2.0,I ordered XXL and that's what the tag said but it was really small
2.0,"I'm a runner and I do not recommend these socks.  I am 6' with a ladies 9.5 narrow shoe and fairly developed calves.  The socks grip my calves very tightly (to the point of discomfort) and do not provide any compression on the foot.  So I get a sloppy feel on the shoe, but at the same time my calves are being squeezed very tight - not a great combination.  I also dislike that they're called ""wool socks"" when the wool content is under 25%.  Get yourself some Smartwool, it's worth it for a better fit."
2.0,"I love the charm.  It is perfect in size.  Unfortunately, the chain is very weak. It broke and I took it to a jeweler to have it repaired.  That cost $18.  It broke again today in a different place.  I'm really bummed because I love the pendant.  I can't put the pendant on another chain because the ring at the top of the pendant is so small."
2.0,These are so small that I gave them away to someone with grandchildren 3 years old and under.
2.0,Bust line hits in uncomfortable and unflattering way. Material heavier than expected
2.0,It's an ok peice of jewelry. The ring that holds the key to the chain is cheap and weak. Took forever to get here.
2.0,I bought a pair of cotton pj’s similar to these for my brother in law last Christmas. He absolutely loved them. I figured he would love these too. I was disappointed to learn that the top was too short for him. He said it fit like a crop top so he gave the set to my sis.
2.0,I'm typically a perfect size 8 in alfon I but these pants fit weird were too short and too big in the waist
2.0,Very thin and not strong quality at all.  I sent back as I feel it would break very easily.
2.0,"Way oversized & shapeless + thin, textured material on the inside. Normal wear a small or medium, this is the small on me."
2.0,Way bigger than the actual size listed. About as good quality as you can expect for the price listed.
2.0,Was not what i excepted
2.0,the look nice and sturdy out of the box. the heel hook should be sewn twisted so they will lay smooth going up your leg. these twist up your leg as they are sewn flat
2.0,"I try to be fair in reviewing of watches. honestly I love watches but this one had to go back to amazon. The fit, and finish was not bad about what you would expect on a sub 100$ watch. The issue i had with the watch was that it gained about 1-5 minutes an hour, by the end of the day i was marking down legal records with severely incorrect time stamps. That is something i just can not stand for in a watch. I have many automatic watches and this is honestly the worst at keeping time out of any I've ever had. I contacted Invicta customer service prior to sending it back to amazon to see if they would make it right rather than tying up amazon with returning what I would consider a non-functioning piece of equipment however the Invicta customer service people told me I would have to pay &#34;$28.00 service, evaluation, insurance, shipping and handling fee&#34;. This fee is still applicable if your watch is under warranty. In addition to paying for the shipping to the repair facility. If your looking for a watch like this in this price range I would recommend you go with one from Orient or Seiko rather than Invicta."
2.0,Product was way  too small.  My stomach was trying to burst through the side slit.  Order up next time.  Blue color was lovely though.
2.0,"(1st) let me say I'm an urban explorer/ urban survivalist.<br />So I need things I can depend on. When I first got this the zippers was kinda messed up the closed part split up but what Evers I fixed it but not to sure on durability. (2nd) don't mistake this for any type of tactical backpack, the only useful molly webbing is on the front of the backpack the sides and top where the strap is, is useless the center molly webbing is kinda wide and the ones on the sides of it is small so what I'm saying is you can only put 1 strap threw. Haven't got much time to do my urban exploring yet because of work but will do it soon I'll update on how it does in the rain and durability part."
2.0,"Nice enough watch, but the band is so cheap, it fell of when I was walking around town.  Good thing it was so cheap."
2.0,These slippers were nice when I first got them but it only took about 2 weeks before they became so stretched out that I can't even wear them. They literally fall off my feet when I walk. Totally waste of money!
2.0,One of the diamond belly rings the top ball is stripped and doesn’t stay on tight and it came this way.
2.0,Se reventó en la 3 puesta
2.0,It came looking rusty. Wore it once and never again
2.0,Too small and tight. I am 145 lbs.
2.0,The size run a little small and the vest is made cheaply
2.0,it was OK material is spandex and did not fit me right
2.0,Too small and couldn’t wear it.
2.0,"If my son pees at all, he is leaking out of this thing.  It's not good at preventing leaks."
2.0,Horrible fit. Very matronly. Makes you look saggy
2.0,Shirt is cute and lightweight!
2.0,"This ring looks cheap, which I guess it is.  I was underwhelmed so I returned the ring. Also, my engagement ring is a Cathedral set and the ring didn’t match up well with it.  Save your money up and invest in a nice wedding band."
2.0,Fits well but broke the second time I wore it. Very irritating since I was on a trip!
2.0,Small and tight in the shoulder.
2.0,All I know it's not a 2x.it looks like a Large.
2.0,Everything was great but it was in a bag with no markings and it did not come with the mask.  😕
2.0,"Expected watch to be heavier.. love the buckle band but it comes undone very easily, has fallen off my wrist unexpectedly 2 times. Over all the watch is beautiful but would not buy it again."
2.0,The high wast is not for me. I have a med rise Judy blues and love them.
2.0,"Fit strangely in the sleeves,"
2.0,"We lost the kids masks up until we started looping them around their necks.  As for me, I was constantly walking up to the store and realizing I left my mask in the car.  So now, I hang it around my neck and I'm always ready to go.<br /><br />CONS: the hook is a bit hard for the kids to manage on their own & the material is stiff so it curls up as of it needs to be unwound. Would not buy again."
2.0,Should offer larger sizes
2.0,It’s smaller than I was expecting. I don’t really like it.
2.0,"They just don't seem to fit quite right.  They are very short, like ankle length and it feels like there is to much internal fabric for your foot to get in comfortably.  Im a size 7 in women's, never had this problem before.  Would not buy again"
2.0,"It was a nice chain but it broke quickly. I thought I got a good deal, but I did not."
2.0,"Beautiful watch but, it has never worked right! So I am going to send back if I can........!"
2.0,They are much bigger than I wanted and are very thin.  Also the closer piece for your ear lobe is not sturdy and I almost lost one twice as it fell off and rolled under a bench.
2.0,These aren't women's. They're juniors or misses. They wouldn't go up past my knees.
2.0,Very disappointed. Owned for several weeks only carried for a few weeks and the inside pocket has come apart. Ordered the tan color but is really orange. Great style shape and size nut terrible quality
2.0,Kinda flimsy and thin.
2.0,"Very cheap and thin -- I believe it's cotton, not linen. Not really a coat; more like a cheap shirt. Didn't even try it on, because I'm returning it."
2.0,This was not at all how I expected I expected the material to be more dressy but it wasn’t. And it was so huge up in the shoulders and top it just was not flattering at all on me. I’m an hourglass shape and I thought this would be a great fit but it sure wasn’t.
2.0,Really sad I Loved the color but got a rash after a couple of days.  Every other color I ordered I didn't get a rash
2.0,"I thought the dress was beautiful in the picture, but reality doesn’t quite live up to it. The dress is long, I am 5’9” and it hits me almost mid-calf. The material is shiny polyester. The seams around the waist are horribly sown. I will wear it,  because I don’t have time to get a new dress  but then it will end up in the trash. Not happy"
2.0,Too Small not stretchy at all
2.0,Super short and really lowcut.
2.0,"I absolutely LOVE swallow birds. When I finally found this ring, I had to have it. When I got it, I wore for a little while and then had to take it off because the beak and tail kept cutting me<br />My boyfriend even tried to file the point down for me and it didn't work. So unfortunately,  I dont get to wear it.. disappointed"
2.0,Bought this in a large. The material feels like felt-you know the kind you would do arts and crafts with? Comfortable but most likely returning it.
2.0,"Material is very thin and staticky, tru to size but I returned it"
2.0,Shirt way shorter than expected. Otherwise nice material.
2.0,This was a very nice skirt with perfect fit but it really smell bad. I took it out and tried to air it out maybe because of the material but it did work out. It stunk really bad.
2.0,The material was super thin! It was not worth the $100!
2.0,Runs too small not true to size. All wrinkled and style looks cheap.
2.0,"Good looking hat, fits well.  The material is very thin and the brim does not hold it's shape."
2.0,"Runs very small.  An XL fit my daughter, she's a size 8/10.  Pretty light weight material.  No content info/tag.  Supposed to be cotton knit but can't confirm.  My daughter likes them.  The cut is nice for her."
2.0,Super duper tight! No matter what size you wear they will fit skin tight.
2.0,It’s pretty at first but in a few uses it gets very rusty.
2.0,Kind of stiff.  My legs feel restricted.  There was a hole in one of the pockets that a quarter could pass through.  I wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,"These earrings are cute, but do not look like turquoise at all. Not like the picture"
2.0,Cute but poor quality. The stud moves around and is bent. The plastic backs do not help keep earring on
2.0,Cool name bad fit.
2.0,Broke in a week.
2.0,This particular size too big.
2.0,"You need to wrap it in cotton or some cover, otherwise will change color. Very thin."
2.0,"I knew it would run small, but I didn't think it would run THAT small. If you're bigger than a size 12, don't bother. However, the material was nice."
2.0,"I usually wear a small-medium sweatshirt for comfort. However this is just too long and big at the waist. If you are petite, I would suggest a small size."
2.0,Low quality and does not fit right
2.0,I usually order a medium - 34B but this is way too big and not enough support to use while running. Maybe the smaller one would be better.
2.0,"Great material on arrival impressed by size and amounts of pockets. HOWEVER, recieved on the 8th of October and by the 12th the bag was ripping on the strap. See picture."
2.0,The engraving shows black it was a light yellow hardly able to see what it says
2.0,"Read some other reviews that said sizing was small so I ordered a medium instead, it was super baggy and way too short even for a crop top, maybe 2 inches below the bottom of my chest and that’s being generous. I honestly don’t think it would have fit right even if I ordered the small. Shirt is super soft and looks exactly like the picture, only reason it doesn’t have one star."
2.0,I am in search for packing cubes that are high quality. These are my third set of packing cubes. I usually just use the small and medium size. I am a flight attendant so I use these daily for my carry on. I liked the color but I was very disappointed that my zipper ripped off. Will be searching for a new brand.
2.0,This item is very small and yet long in length.  The fabric is thin and I wonder if it will survive a washing.  I would not reorder this item.
2.0,It look like you printed something on your napking at your house printer.
2.0,"This shoe bag is really cute and I liked that there are 3 pockets to put different footwear. I would put my gym shoes in the big pocket and my slippers in the front mesh pocket. I really liked it because I could put my shoes in the same position in the bag each time (soles down) keeping it cleaner in my mind. After maybe 7 months of use, the zipper started coming apart or it wouldn’t zip up. Giving it 2 stars because I really liked it when the zipper worked properly."
2.0,"Super cute ring, I was excited to receive it but it arrived with the stone cracked and broken. Chipped and rough feeling. I went to exchange it but no longer available in my size... So disappointing. I would purchase again if they had my size available."
2.0,"Falling apart already and only unpacked it there's a whole and a string coming apart from the bottom, very thin material get what you pay for if that! Arms are shorter than what I would like"
2.0,color was pretty but way to big...
2.0,"Love the color, size and thickness.  The fabric does not seem to be cotton but a type of rayon.  After washing a couple of times the scarf is pilling quite a bit."
2.0,Runs very smaller than description.
2.0,Don't know how to describe my complaint. Lol bad design....the section that protects his private part separates when he sits down and allows his private part to stick out. Not very comfortable for him
2.0,"Way too small. Color is nice, fabric feels good, pockets are roomy, but definitely not an xxl across the chest. Long enough and even fits across the stomach and hips (where I am the biggest), but is tight through the shoulders and chest."
2.0,"I odered a size 1 for my granddaughter. Her shoes are now a 13, so I thought it would be smart to order a size larger. They are way too big!  It will probably be at least a year before she will fit into them. Granddaughter was very upset that they were too big. Cute shoe beside running large."
2.0,"These are great, very cute, inexpensive accessory. I've had them for a month or so, and they are already starting to loose their silvery color.They are plastic, by the way."
2.0,"I find the crystals dull looking, and the clasp is so loose that I'm afraid it will fall off without me even noticing.  So disappointed in the overall look and quality of this piece."
2.0,The studs look good but the backs are too small and slip through the button hole. I used them a day ago and was told multiple times that my shirt was open because the stud backings are just too small. Returned.
2.0,"I can't even really wear these. They are so thick that it's almost impossible to breathe through it. Seriously fogged up my glasses as well. I've worn one, the other two are just sitting in the drawer. I don't recommend them."
2.0,Comfortable and easy to use but broke after about a month. Your Ionic might be waterproof but don’t dream of getting this band wet or it will fall apart.
2.0,"Unfortunately the suction power on the ones I got were weak. They constantly got water in them. I wore them for regular pool play and they were okay, not amazing, but then I did laps in them and they absolutely fell apart, I kept having to dump the water. It seemed maybe they’d work better on someone with a wider face/head. Disappointing!"
2.0,"Necklace would have been great, but the tassel was not included in package. ☹️ I will be returning for a refund. Too bad because I wanted to wear it."
2.0,Bigger than I thought they would be and they clearly are fake. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,"Too big for a woman.  Very heavy. Very difficult to take out links.  Looks pretty, but really suited for a man not a woman."
2.0,Material like a rain coat.
2.0,"this looks great on my fitbit, but after a month or so, the color started to wear off.  It's unfortunate, because the red/purplish color is really pretty.<br />Update:  lowered to a 2, as the color is rapidly wearing off (not getting it wet either) and the wires have started breaking off, so it catches on things."
2.0,I’m 6’ with a long torso and the bottom of this shirt hung way to low. Almost mid thigh.
2.0,Awkwardly shaped. Bad sears -- saggy in areas. The back is cute but I don't think I'll every wear this due to it's malfunctions.
2.0,"The Charis Allure Women's Capri Jogger Pants are kind of strange product and not in a good way.<br /><br />FIT: I got a Medium and they are WAY too long to be capri's as the legs touch the top of her ankles.  As she is 5'10"", she's never had a problem with fit when buying a Medium - usually the exercise pants she gets are too short.<br /><br />LOOK: Beyond them not being capri length, the blousing on the top and the exterior draw string make these pants look like PJ's rather than exercise pants.<br /><br />MATERIAL: Polyester is not a material associated with workout gear - at least since the early 90's.  The material is very thin so it COULD be used as pants over running shorts on cooler days, but they are so thin I wouldn't wear them without shorts.<br /><br />Overall I was not super enthused by the Charis Allure Women's Capri Jogger Pants.  They aren't priced yet, but I would assume they'd cost between $12-$20.  My wife plans on giving them to one of our daughters for PJ pants.  Not good for much else..."
2.0,"My girls were thrilled to receive this. There is a lot of jewelry for the price. However, many jewels had fallen off before we even opened the package. Nearly all of the jewels had fallen off within a week. The jewel also broke. If you get this, be ready with your glue gun."
2.0,"I gave this as a gift.  It very nearly stayed here, though.  The only drawback is that the bolo chain can be a bit difficult to adjust if you're not very flexible.  There's a learning curve to that.  The turquoise is a beautiful robin's egg blue.<br /><br />Update:  This broke after only a few days.  The 2 stars are for the beautiful stones."
2.0,they were big an heavy
2.0,"When I first bought and tried on the dress I liked it. After washing on cold cycle and hanging to drip dry, I wore and it had shrunk making the dress shorter, I am five foot six. I spent the day pulling the dress down and feeling self conscious. I bought it to wear to Disney. It will be upcycled."
2.0,Color and tye die design is good but I ordered a L and it's more like a M.  Fabric has rough cheap feel.
2.0,So slim
2.0,I liked them but they run very small so tend to slip down.
2.0,Mask looks good but it was not properly packaged.  It arrived with a crack in the middle.  Needed it for tomorrow night so off to a store and returning this one.
2.0,The hat has no hold or stiffness so as soon as it’s off your head it collapsed in. Also I didn’t think this was just gonna be printed on with a heat press. It’s just not the quality you deserve for the price.
2.0,It came broken 😔😔
2.0,This shirt fits extremely small!
2.0,Colors smear when cap is washed.
2.0,Nice belt but sizing was small ordered XL and did not fit even with stretching. returned it
2.0,Wouldnt fit over my ear without stretching it to the point I thought it was going to break.
2.0,"Bought for my wives birthday.  Cheap construction, zipper snags, washing instructions in a foreign language (she will take a guess at how to wash).  Got her larger than she normally wears so she'd have room to move, it is tight.  Maybe returning.  Would not buy again."
2.0,to wide. even with socks. length was right.
2.0,"Is neither adjustable, nor a bracelet. Charm feels plastic."
2.0,Fits wayyy too large.
2.0,Did not like the material of this skirt PERIOD
2.0,super bulky the prongs are little hard to fit. steel feels rough! I wouldnt recommend this product!
2.0,Broke on the 3rd day i wore it.
2.0,their too small
2.0,Ran a little small but cute. Just order accordingly
2.0,"Nice looking, but too small: sent them back.<br />I'll try another brand.<br /><br />39' Hips MEDIUM = NO GO.<br /><br />Queenie KE,<br /><br />Queenie Ke  update your size chart!<br />BOTH of my Medium leggings didn't fit<br /><br />Amazon Prime:<br />SHAME<br />Arrived 5 days from order: this is SUBPRIME and customer service said, ""read the fine print: 5 ""business"" days"".<br />Prime used to be a no-brainer, but increasingly, I find the ""Devil In The Details""...I'm paying for this, why?"
2.0,I am very disappointed on this item. Its probably just my body but this dress made me look short and wide. Not very complementing.. Im 5’2 and 155 lbs..
2.0,"Look cheap, I probably won't wear them."
2.0,I really wanted to love this.<br />1) the metal wasn't cut properly so it was really rough and caused a lot of irritating on my ear.<br />2) cute but a little to big
2.0,"They don't stay on very well.  I was hoping they would work, but the slightest brush against a counter or piece of clothing, and the rubberband slips off the cuff.  Wish it worked!"
2.0,Inside material is itchy but I liked the colors
2.0,Came so tangled up but it’s ok. Dainty and ok
2.0,Nice dress too small not true to size. Hard to zip at band
2.0,Was already broken when it arrived
2.0,The product was too small for my mom as a gift. So if you wear a small get a large or x-large.
2.0,"I bought this for a chorus concert for my daughter. She needed a modest skirt for performances. I paid $27 for this skirt and it is very thin, see through and runs small.  I read other reviews and ordered a size up and it was still small.  I do not recommend this product.  It is not worth the money."
2.0,Print on the front was plastic and peeling..
2.0,Very wide and let's to much light in.
2.0,Pretty skimpy material - can't wear it under any thin clothes.  Would not recommend.
2.0,"Actually the fit was ok, but the slipper socks shed something terrible when washed. Would like to return them"
2.0,"I bought the 3 pack both times.  First time all 3 had treads coming apart.  Second time same thing.  I really like the tanks when they stay together, which is why I bought a second time... Shame on me. :("
2.0,"We bought 2. One didn’t come with the fan to blow it up, therefore it’s useless. Neither have hands like pictured."
2.0,"cheap, thin, and the straps wont stay up on the shoulders because it was cut with same as smaller ones, just stretched out bigger, so the straps are more to the sides of garment. And they keep falling down, I even adjusted them as much as I could, did not help any. Color is way off what it shows, not nearly as bright either. The fabric is so thin, no body to it at all, it just hangs and I felt naked in it."
2.0,No me gusta porq tiene unas cuentas muy grandes y la figura es orible se ve muy ordinaria voy a devolverla no va con mi muñeca es esageradamente grande
2.0,"The hood and face cover fit very small, and the hood has a chemical smell to it. Gave it 2 stars because it did arrive in a timely fashion."
2.0,"I love the dress, but wasn't aware that it ran small, and tight in the chest.  Can't wear it.  A reason to loose weight for me......lol"
2.0,Boot size is too big but the leg part is too tight. This boot isn't made properly! Don't suggest this to anyone!
2.0,"I found the clasp very uncomfortable, you had to secure each time . I was not a fan of the color . It also felt too bulky !! I ordered this item for a formal wedding and had to return ."
2.0,not what it looked like in picture disappointed
2.0,"Its pretty but small, im S and i ordered XL, even son is so small"
2.0,One of the clamps broke when I first put it on
2.0,This suit was nice but run very small
2.0,"The color is a little darker than the image, but nothing to complain about. I ordered a medium which fit fine, but the sleeves were short. There was at least 3"" of space between the sleeve and start of my hand. Just returned today. Would have ordered a large, but, at the moment of this review, only have x-small and small."
2.0,"It was super shiny material, and I did not like how it looked."
2.0,"So I’m normally a size 14 or 16 depending on the stretch of the jean, but these are definitely not true to size. The 16 was so small that when it hit my upper thighs I couldn’t pull them up and the material was quite stiff with almost no stretch to them at all. I got the black pair with the rips on the knee. They looked more like dress pants, not the jeans in the picture and the material had basically no give."
2.0,Cheaply made fit like a medium/large. I ordered an extra small
2.0,"Got them today, wore them for an hour and the lens popped out. I guess you get what you pay for"
2.0,Dress is poor quality. I would not buy again.
2.0,The quality was extremely poor.  The dress was not even hemmed at the bottom and started rolling up immediately
2.0,The short set fit like pajamas; it’s not cute to wear outside of the house.
2.0,Breaks super easy. I got these for my son who was a lifeguard over the summer. They look really cool but are terrible. He told me they scratch really easy. Then not even a week after he had them they broke. Never again.
2.0,It is small. But fabric is good
2.0,great size. Doesn't stay closed very well though
2.0,Keeps twisting. Looks cheap. Disappointed
2.0,"I ordered several of these shirts and they arrived looking very nice in the packaging. However, upon trying the shirt on I realized the medium is far larger than a typical medium-sized shirt (and the sizing chart was not much help).<br />If I can return them for a better fit, I will raise my rating."
2.0,"Not only did these fit too small, but when I tried to at least move around in them I felt like someone would have a hard time bending or kneeling in them. Would not buy if you plan on doing any type of work requiring any of those or even simply tying your shoe."
2.0,Nice but way toosmall
2.0,"Horribly cheap looking, plastic earrings. Too bad because the colors are pretty but everything is plastic - not worth the $20 I paid for them."
2.0,Too tight and too thin for my use.
2.0,The sleeve was sewn to the shoulder of the dress
2.0,way too small for an adults face. child size.
2.0,"If you are anything past a B, this is not going to hold your boobs. The bottoms were three sizes too small and I wear a size 6 in pants. The entire swimsuit is stiff and I can not imagine it being comfortable if I order a larger size."
2.0,See through! You need to wear a nude colored slip and my nude bra still showed!
2.0,The image is distorted because it gets lost in the sewn creases.  The mask is very large as well. Too big for an adult female.  I returned it.
2.0,i love pink roses and i brought this dress;  i am plus size  i ordered the plus size 3<br />i couldn't even get it over my head !!!!  and i do not have a overyly large head<br />this is a size plus 3  REALLY  !!!!  No way<br />if i could get it over my head ; it would probably fit like a large.<br />i am going to try to cut off the top and make a skirt out of the bottom i think that might work right<br />i was so hoping it would fit ; i love maxi skirts and dresses<br />prbably won't be buying these dressses any more<br />there was any tags or any thing in the dress<br />one thing i did like was you would not be able to see through the dress<br />the roses was so pretty .<br />oh well
2.0,Wore it twice before it broke.  But I loved how it looked.
2.0,"It's as much denim as Sears Toughskins were in the 70's.  More polyester than cotton feel to them.  Best thing is that cat hair will not cling like it would to denim or flannel.  Nicely made, just definitely not denim.  Faux denim?  Didn't realize that was a thing. 🥴"
2.0,These skewers are very flimsy and bend easily with any kind of pressure. I bought them to skewer stuffed lamb chops and they worked at least once for that. I would be dubious about whether they would work very well trying to hold the stuffing in a turkey. I bought the cheapest I could find because I thought I would not use them again since I already had skewers but not enough for my dish for eight people. If you’re looking for something that will last you might want to find a product that costs more
2.0,"It is ok piece of jewelry , don't know if I'll ever wear it though, not my favorite ."
2.0,I love these earrings I'm a Scorpio and I have several scorpion pieces they are quite heavy but it's okay for me<br />Update they broke way too heavy to stay in ear waste of money
2.0,Sunglasses looked great! Then the arm fell off. How does a screw fall off after less than 2 weeks of wear?
2.0,Lenses seem to be a nice lens to look through but on my Oakleys they were too short. Didnt seem as long as the original ones so I returned them.
2.0,"This feels like a dress made by Dollar Tree. I wouldn’t be opposed to wearing it as it is very thin and lightweight, but I would never spend the asking price and will be returning it regardless of fit.<br /><br />For reference, I am 217, 5’8” and pear shaped. This dress was too tight in the hips and required a lot of shimmy just to get on. It did not fit at all. Not terrible sizing, however. I felt it was reasonable, just not my size in this brand."
2.0,"No backings to secure earrings. Tassels are clingy, do not hang freely."
2.0,"Nice watch for the money; however, it does not keep good time. It gains about 3-4 minutes a month. You get what you pay for."
2.0,Material good but pants way to long<br />and they were also big<br />Don’t like them at all
2.0,"The bag is cute,  but unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before purchasing.  This bag smells so awful! I have tried everything,  but cannot get rid of the fish smell!!! Returning."
2.0,It's a belt and holds up your pants but it doesn't appear to be &#34;100% full grain leather&#34;. Inner strap (facing your body) appears to be some kind of plastic. Doesn't Amazon police false claims like this?  My take is it will crack and split in short order like any cheap belt.
2.0,"Es un vestido bien hecho, pero no se parece a la foto y me queda grande"
2.0,Looks great but the closure doesn't latch shut. It often falls open.
2.0,"Plus Size Waist Trainer Vest for Weight Loss Women Training Corset Cincher Kim,Black Vest,8XL  ★★★  from SheMeHer on July 16, 2017<br /><br />Great Material, But VERY VERY short<br /><br />This is my first trainer, wasn't my first choice but the price was right. The best PRO is the material, it is super thick and has some stretch. HOWEVER, the cons list is a bit longer: The vest is very VERY short. It is about the length of a long line bra. The companies size chart is wack. But If you are a size 3x in regular sizes and order an 8x, be prepared for a STRUGGLE. Make sure u don't have any long nails on and give yourself plenty of time to get in it. Putting on a high waisted tummy tamming shaper FIRST might help u a little. Haven't worn it yet and haven't even fastened it all the way down because I have on long nails. But as soon as I remove them and try to get my vest on properly I will update my review."
2.0,"Warm and cozy slipper but the tag is sewn right into the heel cup, and the stitching is a bump...right where the weight of your heel comes down. Won't walk much in them. Would love them otherwise."
2.0,It fit very small
2.0,I have a 10 lb dog. She barely fit into the pocket. She hangs out to the point that I feel I have to hold on for her safety. It is much smaller than I expected.
2.0,The material is a thick spandex material. It’s very comfy but runs big! It’s also fairly long and I am 5’6’ 120 pounds
2.0,"Some reason it infected my wife’s belly button, looks great but we had to dump it"
2.0,NOT AS PICTURED! What I will say is I like the material and how big it is...but very disappointed in the color. Not the same as pictured. I do not like to wear pink and they decided to make this one with pink in it?
2.0,shoe sole was too easy to break.<br />I have two shoe broken already.
2.0,I was disappointed to have them come in many different shades instead of one shade for our singers.[[ASIN:B00U6CC9EM Hip Hop 50s Shop Vintage Style Sheer Chiffon Scarf (teal)]. When a person orders 40 of them under the same number you would expect them to be of the same and the quality the same.  Rita
2.0,"I ordered a pair of these ""crib"" ones through another site and they are cute and really well made, but the back elasticized part that goes around the ankle is so tight that the shoe fits very poorly if even slightly bigger then the foot. They're annoying to get on and they come off way too easily and oh yeah that elastic never stretched and looked so tight and uncomfortably cut into my poor baby's ankle. You can see how they look in the photos, but it honestly has no give. It's really strange. The worst shoes we've had yet."
2.0,"I love the top but, the lace trim on the Army Green is more of a forest green. It's not like in the seller's photo. You can see by my photo that the sleeve lace is way different than the trim around the neckline."
2.0,You get what you pay for. Rhodium ears off quickly. The metal gets pitted. The stones are dull and ok looking. It's pure costume jewelry but not the good kind.
2.0,"I ordered 2 to use as friendship/diffuser bracelets. One came just as pictured. On the second one, the fixed bead furthest from the center was too far away, making it asymmetrical. I have requested a replacement."
2.0,Easily breaks! I ordered 4 and one of them broke out of no where on the 2nd day :(
2.0,This fabric would have to be ironed on a linen setting. Beautiful colors.
2.0,Feels more like spandex than I would've expected. Buy a size up. Very thin material.
2.0,"These glasses have more glare and reflection than any of my bazillion other readers, and there is a strange feeling coating on them, like a dusting of flour. The flour-ish stuff is in the plastic bags they came in. The plastic bags are worn and roughed up, like there was weight on them. I give a star for correct magnification and another for a sturdy build."
2.0,Too short. Didn't like the fit.
2.0,it wasn't  well made buttons fell off first wash.
2.0,The color and fit were off so I ended up returning it
2.0,I got the necklace in a timely matter but after two days of wearing it it broke on me it kinda makes me sad
2.0,"Pretty and shiny when received, but already starting to discolor."
2.0,"When the shirt got hot just sitting on the kitchen table on a 90* day the logo stuck to itself, and when I peeled it apart some of it came off the shirt."
2.0,The dress was pretty and decent for the price however it was incredibly too small. I went one size up and it fit two sizes too small at least. I recommend going up at least two sizes if you plan to buy this
2.0,"Looks kind of cheap, not like the picture"
2.0,"They are cute but really hard to get in and stay up. It takes some maneuvering to finally get the look you want. I had to open them slightly to turn up the lobe. Then, I squeezed them to stay on. One of my ears ended up hurting when removing. It just takes too much time and energy to wear unless you keep them on 24/7."
2.0,This looks cute in the pictures however the fabric feels cheap and it runs very small. Returned this item. Do not recommend
2.0,"Don't waste your money ..too cheap,dark and it strips fast."
2.0,"Too much stiffness around the zipper, especially at the top, for my taste. That said, I will probably use it again in a (sprint) triathlon rather than replacing it."
2.0,I ordered an extra large and it was more like a small. Very pretty sure but I definitely will be returning it
2.0,"Eventhough orfered right size,came to small"
2.0,"It's made for people with short torsos. Order a size up at least. Yes, an additional size up. Pretty cheap material also."
2.0,Unfortunately this belt just doesn't fit my needs. I was looking for a comfortable belt that has some flex for moving around but can hold my pants up even with tools in my pockets. This belt is definitely comfortable but has too much flex to it that if I have anything other than my phone and wallet in my pockets my pants start to sag way too much. I'll probably use the belt when I'm not at work as it works fine as long as I don't have anything weighing down my pants. I'll need to continue my search for a better belt that can fill my needs when it comes to my work pants.
2.0,I bought this purse about a month ago as I liked the look of it and it had all the storage I needed. Unfortunately it stunk so bad when it came out of the package I had to throw it in the washer twice to get the smell out. I thought that was what did the zippers in but looking at the reviews it seems like there is a definite problem with the zipper quality. Every zipper on this purse was sticky and the one pocket wouldn't open at all. I won't be buying this brand again.
2.0,know your sizes.
2.0,"I didn’t get what I ordered (I ordered a long sleeved dress with a tutu skirt and only received the tutu skirt), but my daughter likes the tutu and it is pretty and good quality/ not scratchy. Didn’t seem worth the trouble to exchange it."
2.0,Not for me. The style looks cute in theory bit in person it was just not appealing
2.0,Definitely serves its purpose but quality is not great.
2.0,Fit good but scratch very easy only last one month and the reflective is coming off
2.0,"The dress overall is cute. It came with a rip right in the seam which was frustrating but not surprising. The dress was cheap and I was able to sew it. I felt like it was long, so I also hemmed it up about 4 inches. It is also a bit see-through, so I’ll have to get a slip before wearing it. Overall cheap dress, but manageable if you have the time and skills to fix it up."
2.0,"Bought this product on February 12th. The colors are great. BUT I've had one of these on my keys since I bought them and it broke! I don't even play with it (stretching it out, swinging it around, etc) and its already broke. Disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Not very warm at all. I only wear them inside to work (my office has a big window that is drafty). I have to wear both pairs at the same time to get any kind of warmth. I would send them back if I hadnt tried them out today.
2.0,Too small for my curly hair
2.0,I disappointed. Wasn’t as long as pictured and kind of cheep.
2.0,Appearance was disappointing compared to what was shown.
2.0,Very cute but super thin and see thru.  No lining and no Boob support
2.0,"If you’re here for “that brand” of cardi, yes, these are labeled MAK.  HOWEVER, the quality of the material of these is terrible.  I wore it twice, and not even a whole day each time, and it got so fuzzy, that not even a sweater shaver can save it.  And, I even washed on gentle cycle and laid flat to dry.  I am throwing them away.  I’m giving it two stars, bc I do like the fit of it, but I wish they’d make them out of better materials.  I couldn’t imagine paying the price some retailers charge for this sweater, given the quality.  I’ve purchased cheaper cardis here that are much better quality.  If you want a cardi to wear once, this is it."
2.0,Diffidently for muscular men very elastic and would show half ur benches if ur all muscled up
2.0,"Beautiful bracelet and daughter loved it. Not good for sensitive skin, however. Left marks on her skin"
2.0,Its a nice lopking cover but really doesnt hold up very well.
2.0,cute but the plating came off within about a week.
2.0,Was very tight and mich too long.
2.0,"I took my husband's measurements before I ordered, and ordered a size up. Still incredibly small. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2.0,"The color is way too bright (much more so than the photo) and the material is not as expected.  It is a thin, crepey material that is not flattering. Seemed to run a little large.  I returned it."
2.0,"The size is ridiculously small! I ordered a Medium. I am 5.6 feet tall and 128 pounds. I usually wear Small but since these pants were for a performance production, I wanted them to be slightly loose. I was surprised that I could not even put a Medium size pants over my pants. I brought them to rehearsal to see if they would feet shorter smaller girls and they did not even stretch on them!!! WRONG SIZE! Do not order this product unless you are super skinny and shorter than 5.4"
2.0,The armholes gaped. The chest size was right but not the arm holes
2.0,Did not understand that it's just a piece of cloth. I thought it was already shaped to head.
2.0,"It arrived as the wrong size, as well it looked like it was bent and kinked."
2.0,Should have been half the price..... not great quality and some pieces broke already
2.0,"Strings are to weak, one broke immediately  .I found some string and fixed it."
2.0,As far as replacements they're  good for temporarily. The strap is more secure in one way better than the original version. But I had it for a week and more than 3 times it has come undone from the watch itself.  I snap it back into place but eventually it becomes undone.  And it's just one strap one side i switched sides and the same one strap comes undone.  I wanted to love the straps because it's more secure than original ones.
2.0,"I wanted so much to like these earrings.  They looked very cute on the website.  I purchased these for my daughter as a nice pair of earrings that wouldn't cause any ear irritation.  They just arrived today, and right out of the box I knew they wouldn't work. The website clearly indicates secure screw back - something I would demand of any earrings over $100 (gold or not).  There is no screw back or thredding to be found.  Consequently, back they go."
2.0,"The chemical smell is strong,  like clothes you buy from the wish app. I'll have to wash it a couple times before she can wear it. Fits fine though."
2.0,The reviews said that it ran small and they were correct. It has a really long back that is way out of proportion with the rest of the shirt. I’ve decided to keep it and give it two stars because it’s not bad under a cardigan. I just wouldn’t wear it by itself.
2.0,"Rating 2 for the refund and quality of the hosiery. The pictures to sell are a bit misleading. They’re not thick, it’s definitely more like hosiery, but nice hosiery. These would be really good to attach a garter belt to. But the bows immediately fell off. They’re held onto the hosiery by what feels like hot glue/ craft glue, and there’s no way you’re getting the glue off without ripping the material. I just pinned mine back on with very small safety pins. Highly DONT reccomend if you were looking for something more sturdy. I’m also 5’3 and around average weight, and these came up a lil above the knee. I was hopi ng for a bit higher, but they also seem to slide down. So more like knee-hosiery? The quality of this item should be like 2 bucks lol. Anyways, just spend extra on some nicer quality socks, don’t be a cheap-o like me, because the quality of it shows."
2.0,The red & black are not at all as shown in the picture. The red is more orange red & the light black.
2.0,Really cute outfit for little girls
2.0,"The fabric was too thin, nice and flower, but very delicate... fit was awkward"
2.0,"Nice looking,but looks cheap,not sure abt natural leather,not recomended"
2.0,"Update: I ordered the Large and I’m very happy with the design.  Tommy and “don’t be a baby” is on the front and back. As you can see on the pictures, they sent me a used product where pilling is done between the thighs. I’m only keeping this one because I love Rugrats and the design is there but just horrible that they sent me a used one that is technically damaged with the pilling.  I will have to just shave it off after washing it.  Good thing the design is what I wanted or else I would have return this.<br /><br />Very very soft, a bit tighter than I expected.  Maybe I should have ordered a Large.  I’m 5’4.5 and currently 166 pounds since I’m pregnant but hopefully after I give birth and go back to 125-135 then it’ll fit better.  I am bum that the design was the first image rather than the second image. Mine was the front is all Chuckie and Angelica while the back is Tommy and the quote regarding what babies do.  Really wish Tommy was in the front. Other than that, I like it. Wish all characters and saying are both in front and back."
2.0,This product is ok but cheeky made could of use better quality wood
2.0,I assumed they would fit over my prescriptionglasses.  They did not.
2.0,"Very beautiful looks like the picture but the hook broke within a week, metal piece was very thin and seemed poorly made"
2.0,Arrived fast and fit nice; however the seam ripped the first time I wore them.
2.0,"I have purchased a number of different chin straps for my APAP over the years. This one has a good snug fit with the chin part holding my chin well. The Velcro closure allowed for a good fit. Unfortunately, the strap did not stay in place. It kept sliding away from the top of my head and required frequent adjustment.The company may want to consider adding another strap for stability. This was not a good buy for me."
2.0,"Posts both bent flat to earring upon delivery...it was odd considering they were in a padded envelope, inside a box (alone) with those big air tube things. They snapped right off when I attempted to bend them back. They get two stars only because they were cute. Disappointed to return but we all know the old saying about getting what you pay for... They could not possibly have gotten bent in transit."
2.0,"Don’t be fooled by the picture. While the watch is cute, the picture is misleading. You can’t see the hands that say hour and minutes and the numbers are so small that my child who does not need glasses can not even see it."
2.0,"Wish i read the reviews first. Like another poster said, this is kahaki not gray like the picture. Even the description is misleading. What color do tou think of when &#34;oyster&#34; and &#34;stone&#34; is used to describe a product? Gray, right? Not khaki. Other than that it's an ok product, but i would not have bought if i knew it was khaki."
2.0,Id band not stamped
2.0,"Putting these socks on was extremely difficult.  I think it took me 15 minutes to put the first sock on, and it was way too tight.  I never put the 2nd sock on, too much trouble.  I gave them away."
2.0,Not distressed like the photo
2.0,My son wears masks and these are not big enough  for his face; they pull his outer ear down.
2.0,"These tags are a great color for easy luggage identification and the fastening cord is greatan durable! Unfortunately, the lip of rubber around the clear plastic window isn't deep enough and the tags often come off the carousel with the identification bits half way out. The rubber flexes and the ID paper and plastic window pops right as the lip is too shallow."
2.0,"XL? Really? Too small and I don’t have a big head either. Probably will never use these. Seems to be decent quality, but I feel like they are overpriced."
2.0,Sizes are very small. The large is smaller than any medium I have worn.
2.0,Don’t like the material or the way it fits.
2.0,Shrunk considerably.  Enough to not be able to wear them.
2.0,I ended up returning these shorts.  I thought I indicated the right size (Medium) but they were significantly smaller than I anticipated (they felt like a XS) and I didn't like the material they were made of. I'm 6'1&#34; and ~175 lbs and I probably should have ordered L or XL but didn't want to do the trial and error sizing approach and so decided to go to another brand that had a sizing chart.
2.0,"While perusing Swatch products I couldn't help but notice a Sistem 51 for less than $90, not a bad deal.<br /><br />Upon further inspection I noticed discrepancies in the product details, description, and information. I am not confident that this is the product being advertised or sold.<br /><br />The watch is blue but descriptions state red strap and other design features not found on the watch showm, it also says it needs a battery but All Sistem 51 watches are automatic and only require intermittent hand winding.<br /><br />Not sure what happened here but any enthusiast would be wary, read and heed"
2.0,I took it back it came in a bad state dirty and rough had to return and it runs big
2.0,I like the purse but the smell in it is awful!  It smells like dead fish!!
2.0,Tarnished with one wear. Links has to be secured. Very fragile
2.0,"I have written the seller... we'll see what the recommendation is. I'm just afraid that the replacement ones will break soon too. I am tempted to replace the posts on my own with something a little more sturdy. They are adorable and Kate Spade... but it is still cheap (very cheap, apparently) costume Jewelry. $48 is a lot for what you get, in my opinion.<br /><br />Update: Seller will not return my emails!"
2.0,"I did not love the fabric on this dress. It was thin and, with the way it draped, showed every ripple and bulge on my body. It is also  the type of fabric that wrinkles easily. I tried it on, took it off, and returned."
2.0,Huge! Not at all what I was expecting. The “gems” look like they are going to fall off. They just look cheap.
2.0,"Not true to size and material are also cheap, I return it back"
2.0,"My son loved this, lights ran out almost instantly. We even bought brand new batteries and still it ran through them. Other than that it was okay."
2.0,Toe seam cuts into top of toes
2.0,does not polish much
2.0,"Only reason I did a review like this is to again WARN PEOPLE to read the description. It only is selling one, I of course didn't read completely into it and expected two. It is cute, but I don't want to walk around with only one in. Could order another but why bother."
2.0,Beautiful product but cheap fabric. I washed this once with other soft fabrics and the stitching is coming loose and there are runs in the fabric! I’m very disappointed.
2.0,Ordered for myself but so small I gave it to my granddaughter.
2.0,I wanted to love this product so much. The shirt fits too small and the shorts are a nice fit but the “suspenders” are more for a teen than a toddler. Had to donate because it was just not a good fit.
2.0,Did not like. J kept flipping backwards.
2.0,"This watch looks good the moment you take it out of the box... then you wear it around and it scratches super easy and the gold paint, yes paint starts to chip off. It is extremely difficult to take the pins out to adjust the size. I had to take a hammer and small nail that could push the pin out. The one they give you is a mirror of the rest of the watch... and that is CHEAP! save yoour money and buy something durable."
2.0,"The necklace was heavier than I expected, which was a good thing and a bad thing. Bad--it's heavier to wear. Good--it made me feel like it was a better quality material instead of just a cheap lightweight plastic. However, the necklace I received had one major flaw. The piece of the necklace right on the front has some sort of plastic coating and it was peeling off. It is noticeable and makes me hesitant to wear it, which I guess is why I have not worn it yet. For that flaw, I give it 2 stars. Had it not had that flaw, I would have given it 4 stars for it's quality and unique design."
2.0,"It was just a bath bomb there was no ring or any jewelry inside,the picture for the product shows a ring...false advertising"
2.0,Doesn't work for texting.
2.0,just poor everything. Poor material. Poor stitching. Poor sizing. Wouldn't recommend
2.0,I ordered a L (5'4 172lbs) but it literally fit kind of short. Almost like a junior size. I paired it with leggings. This would be for a young girl.
2.0,Blisters so not good with bunions
2.0,"Used necklace. Completely scratched. Otherwise pretty, larger than expected."
2.0,I usually love this brand. I love the style of this dress. However the zipper broke before I even got to wear it out of the house.
2.0,Not very happy with this. I've used other cloths that did a better job and did not require so much pressure to remove the tarnish on silver.
2.0,"I normally size up a little but these are way too tiny. I couldn't even get my ankle in them, I can wear size large but got xl just incase. I don't recommend getting anything less than one size up. mine are useless now."
2.0,I went up a size and it was still a small fit for my child.
2.0,Too skinny.
2.0,I loved this navel ring but when I received it the triangles are crooked and it’s way too top heavy. Would not recommend for wearing
2.0,"Does not look as good as the photo. Cheaply made with decal , and embarrassment to wear."
2.0,This jumpsuit didn't look anything like it did on the model. It's certainly the same item but it hangs in a very unflattering manner around the legs and rear. It is sized much larger than the sizing chart would indicate. I returned the item.
2.0,Product runs really small. Had to go up 2 sizes.
2.0,"The holes for the metal thing to fit in, aren’t big enough. Avoid."
2.0,Leg holes are small and my wife isn't but 125 she is small . We ordered an XXL when she usually buys a medium as someone had said it was slightly small bot was that an understatement!
2.0,"This dress was recommended to me and the style is pretty cute on, very forgiving and flattering. My issue is that it is that horrible cheap fabric. (I got an XL which is actually too big, especially given that the recommended size was XXL!) This may not be a problem for everyone but I am so tired of this crappy fabric from so many sellers on Amazon."
2.0,"The charm is really cute but the necklace is super cheap, it very obviously broke and was put back together with some type of wire so it looks very tacky!"
2.0,"From the picture, this looked like a good quality. It is not. The collar is not made properly and the material is cheap-looking and thin; I know it will not last long."
2.0,This product really didn't make me sweat while working out. was kind of disappointed.
2.0,Not comfortable at all. Literally only buy these if you saw them on tik tok and just want to see how your butt looks. You will not want to wear these for long and they are not squat proof if you considered wearing them to workout.
2.0,Snags everything
2.0,"I should have listened to the reviews and not got this.  The enamel that colors the leaves looks like it was thrown on the leaves with a paint brush.  If a spot was missed oh well don't go over it..just get these out to sell.  The item it self is just what I was looking for Something that makes a statement, to bad that they did not do a better job at putting the enamel on it.  I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Thought the dress would be more EXTRA. It looked like a regular black tube dress nothing special. Plus it fitted looser than expected. I usually wear a small could've went with a extra small.
2.0,Runs small but cute shirt.
2.0,Looks okay but smells like rubber.  Regret purchasing it.
2.0,Really small & broke right away
2.0,Skinny string so if the pouch gets at all heavy hurts neck!
2.0,Such a cute sweatshirt! I was really looking forward to wearing it but I ordered an XXL in it would fit someone that is a size 8 or smaller. Thin material. Completely overpriced at $36.01.
2.0,"Ended up returning this because it was way too big for our 2yo. I took a pic of another youth face mask on top of this one for comparison. It’s too bad too, this seemed like a well made mask and our little one is obsessed with construction trucks right now."
2.0,"These were smaller than I hoped for, IF I purchased again I would go for the bigger size."
2.0,"These are nice although some of them don’t close all the way, so my aromatherapy Ball(the ones that came with the pendants) fall out."
2.0,looked great my daughter loved but broke first time she wore it
2.0,Color is not as fresh as seen in the picture
2.0,Beautiful glasses but was tooooo big for my face and head. Im sure would look marvelous on someone with propet size face n head.
2.0,Wore it once and it started coming apart. So disappointing! I order a xlarge thinking a large would be to small but the xl was a little too big. (I’ve been losing weight)<br />I liked it a lot the time I did wear it so I was really upset when I noticed the ribbing poking out.
2.0,very very tiny
2.0,Stones started falling out after wearing twice
2.0,"This would have 5 stars if it fit. The wraparound strap isn’t long enough to fasten over anything wider than a pair of sneakers. Does not fit regular width size 10 boots. The quality is great otherwise, wish I could use it."
2.0,"The shirts are ok but I feel like they run short. I got it to wear under my scrubs, but they wouldn't stay tucked in. One of my shirts came with the seams ripped on the right sleeve."
2.0,Not US sizes
2.0,"After  washing around 8 times will not fit  my face  right, at walmart l can get 4 for7$ and  washable  for  more then 8 times"
2.0,"This mask falls apart very easy, its too heavy, not even comfortable. Hurts my neck"
2.0,"I sent this back because the material did not match up on the skirt seam. It looked pretty silly. I really like the fit and material, so tried to get another one in return. However, the replacement also had a defect."
2.0,Came chipped but I still love them
2.0,"Low quality, poor finish, cheap feeling."
2.0,they are shrinking after 1 wash
2.0,they all  broke within 2 weeks
2.0,It runs small. Its not the color I expected. Its more pink than brown. Its also see though and I am returning it.
2.0,I sized up because I'm always concered that it don't fix I'm normally a Large but I got a XL it fits just fine the only problem is that if you raise your hands even alittle the shirt will go up I don't recommend this unless you're really short I'm 5'4 btw
2.0,"These are HUGE, and the waistband elastic constantly twists--very annoying. They are, however quite comfy for just lounging around the house."
2.0,Yuck.  Stiff plastic.  Totally wrinkled.  Runs small!!!  Sorry I ordered it.
2.0,"This suit arrived on time & the material is really nice. I'm 5'2 in height, 137lbs, 36c bust, 30&#34; waist & 40 hips. I ordered the medium & it fits just right. Not too tight or too loose. The only thing I really don't like is that their is no bust support. The description said no underwire but I thought that it would at least have an elastic band to sewn into the front area to support the boobs."
2.0,"—Feel free to ask me any questions about my review!—<br /><br />I include images in every single review I do. I could not include an image for this one because it was too short and would show my rear and be inappropriate.<br /><br />The dress itself is really cute and I would love it if it wasn’t so short. It is slanted at the bottom, which I didn’t really realize until I got it at my house. I don’t love it but it wouldn’t bother me so much if the shorter side didn’t show my butt cheek. Also, it rides up to show more of my butt cheek. Naturally, it was returned. I purchased it for a Vegas trip but I don’t want an indecent exposure ticket.<br /><br />This product runs true to size besides being short. I ordered a small, which is my usual size, and it fits perfectly! I am 5’6”, 140 lbs, and a size 4 for reference.<br /><br />I hope my description was of use to you!<br /><br />—Follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram for more amazing Amazon finds!—"
2.0,Not good lumpy and hangs too low. Hard to spread out the filling to make it more even.
2.0,"I’m super bummed that this didn’t last. My husband bought this for me for Christmas and I really loved the sentiment and the meaning behind it.  I wore it all of the time and within five weeks my chain broke.  I have yet to buy a new chain for it, but just am bummed that the chain was so cheap for it to break barely a month after receiving it."
2.0,"Very disapointed. This suit was too small, I'm 5'1 and 115 lbs. Does not look like the picture at all."
2.0,US large is not the same size. if you wear US size large then atleast order X-Large here.
2.0,I purchased these as favors for a summer birthday party. The kids liked the idea of getting new sunglasses. However you could barely see the fish print.
2.0,Returned because bag would not stay up
2.0,Is not a good material. They are ok. Wash in delicate because they will have a lot of loose strings.
2.0,I would never recommend these to people because there fake! You can look at them and tell they are! Sooooo.....
2.0,Super comfortable but the color is not like photo it's more of a dingy old brick color..  no lining no panty.
2.0,Very thin. Too large. I meant to return it but forgot. I would recommend going down a size and wearing a slip underneath. I plan to use the dress for lounging around in the house.
2.0,"Unfortunately that white ""shine"" thats in the pictures is actually printed on the earrings I received. It looks like part of the pink strip is not filled in."
2.0,The product description says repeatedly that the dress is floor length (69.5) when in reality it is only 47 inches long (knee length). I give it 2 stars only for that very disappointing issue especially with what you're paying. Other than that the dress is beautiful and the material is very comfortable. Also... IT HAS POCKETS!
2.0,"Cute but cheap! Purse broke after 3 days o regular use.  I would just not waste the money.  I so wish this would have been a better design on the straps because the bag is cute.  I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />Imported<br />Improved quality and craftmanship. smooth zip closure. Material: PU Leather fabric, polyester lining<br />pattern:cute animal print, puppy dog face shape print, two tone color combo<br />2 slip pockets, 1 zip pocket, adjustable matching faux leather shoulder strap,<br />occasion: cocktail, prom, ball, homecoming party style: crossbody handbag, shoulder bag, pouch, wallet, purse<br />Dimension:9.8&#34;x3.5&#34;9.8&#34;"
2.0,Definitely not true to size. My sister is an XL but she ordered a 2XL and it fits like a large. Gave it 2 stars because of the material. Its a good quality and super stretchy.
2.0,"The fabric on this blouse is thinner than toilet paper and not very durable. This blouse  is quite loose fitting. It will not shrink, some people like that but it runs larger, so order a size down."
2.0,"I thought it would be sweater material, but it is really thin rayon.  It looks okay, but I would not buy it again."
2.0,"I reordered this product to replace a gift because the leather is stretched out from use and turned into a necklace rather than a proper choker 9 months later. And now the reordered pendant is plastic, not metal, AND scuffed. There's no way I could gift this trash, definitely returning."
2.0,"rather cheap looking,"
2.0,These don’t really look like the patterns.  Plus they stretch really bad and you can no longer tell the design.  I ended up returning them.
2.0,It is very thin. Looks more vibrant in the pictures. Very see through and you have to wear it off the shoulders to get it to look like it does on the model.
2.0,I purchased because of it being waterproof. By no means is it.  Seams are not sealed.  Water comes through material and of course through the seams.  I returned for refund.  Still searching for the perfect bag to travel with on water.
2.0,"I made it work, but it's a cheap dress. It's definitely not made by a good quality designer. It looks like an amateur hand made the dress."
2.0,"I was so excited when I ordered this dress only to be disappointed when I received it. The dress looks like the picture and would fit tall ladies (I'm  5'6 and the dress reached the floor). However, the dress clings to you and shows every bump and roll (and I'm pretty tiny). I'm normally a small but ordered a medium and I'm not even sure if the large or XL would have made a difference because of how tight the medium was on me."
2.0,Itchy and too small
2.0,"It took for ever to arrive. The top part of the dress is too tight. I gave it a 2 start because the fabric, color and stitching were good. I just think the top part is too small compared to the bottom skirt."
2.0,Nice shoe but too small.
2.0,Runs to small. Ordered XL it was about a medium!
2.0,The quality of the product is good however both items aren't created equally. The navy blue pair did not fit me but the black pair fit right.  I could go up a size to prevent rips.
2.0,"It had potential to be cute, but it was badly torn in two places and was unraveling. It felt very cheap."
2.0,"So my daughter wears only sport bras and she was excited to find something different, well this bra lasted 2 days before the straps broke off.  Very disappointed, as this was a little more pricey then the others we bought."
2.0,"The rings on the planets were placed so low you couldn’t even see them, they were cheaply made and didn’t look good."
2.0,"One of the stones popped off the night after I first put it on... I removed the other one as well so it wouldn't look so strange and the rest is holding up well... Just not what I bargained for. With a better method of attaching the stones, this could be a great cuff..."
2.0,I order Navy this is blue and it is a little tite
2.0,"Although they are very soft and comfortable, they do not stay on well. They would be fine for lounging but not for walking around, defeating the purpose of the grippers."
2.0,"The seems went down the front of the dress, cheaply made."
2.0,Not useful for Covid protection
2.0,"Fellas you know when boxes briefs do that ""roll up thing""? Yeah these do that... I bought these with the hopes of a lovely, snug, pouch fit. I was disappointed. The first mild walk I went on and the wedgie and roll up was unbearable...<br /><br />Would not buy again...<br /><br />Material is decent, quality seems decent but comfort wise, not as good as fruit of the loom that's half the price..."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:601cc30c86053657db71f5ae142c38e]] Beautiful but it's broken at the joint near the latch. I don't wear it a lot because it's fallen off my arm twice! I bought it last year so I don't know what to do or how to repair it costing me more money. I bought the long matching earrings & a similar spinner ring to go with it, too. Very very sad. Help! I'd love to change this review."
2.0,No really M size
2.0,"The material was super soft but no cushion at all, which is kinda the most important part of a slipper. Not impressed :-("
2.0,Bought this as a concert dress for an orchestra. The length on the skirt is like the length of capri pants. Fortunately a neighbor had something on hand that I could use the night of the concert.
2.0,No hanger included with shipment
2.0,It states not to use the Amazon sizes but to use their chart.  I need to return this item.  The size I bought is at least TWO sizes too small.
2.0,"It's way to small and looks werid on, not what I imagined it should look."
2.0,"It it the same size as the others I purchased, but doesn't fit the same. Pretty though."
2.0,"The quality of the fabric was not good, looked very cheap and see through. The color was exact and the for was good."
2.0,"The suit top and bottoms were to totally different  colors, did not match at all, the top was a peachy color and the bottoms and the string around the neck was a pale pink. As far a the size goes I ordered a 3x and it was more like a large. The suit was very nice and we'll made. Sent email and explained to them an promptly refunded my money and told me to keep the suit no questions asked. Customer service is great"
2.0,"These necklaces are pretty, but they are so poorly constructed that the extremely low price doesn't even make up for it.<br /><br />The part that serves as a jump ring (the part connected to the pendant where you thread the chain through) is made of very soft metal.  They bend almost as easily as a twist tie.  Consequently, just the movement of wearing it for a day causes it to loosen and fall off the chain.  Because they are so soft, they can easily be put back on and bent back closed.  But they will fall off again if you don't crimp them with some needle-nose plyers.<br /><br />The chains and clasps may also be made of the same soft metal.  I was able to tighten and repair the clasps when they broke, but when the chains started breaking, I didn't have a small enough tool to fix them.  The only chain that hasn't broken has started to turn black."
2.0,This product did not meet up to my expectations. They sized wrong.
2.0,"not as per the display and description. in the product image, it looks like carbon black, but it is not the same in actual. Your eyes can be seen through the sunglasses. not that satisfied"
2.0,Im 8.5 US womens shoe size and the socks definately dont fit
2.0,Way too thin and way too tight.
2.0,"The Top neck hole is too small to get into it will not fit past your butt, I ordered a 12, I even ordered a size bigger to make sure. The actual size of the bathing suit is fine it is the neck hole, the manufacturer needs to make the back strap lower in the back so that the neck hole is bigger, If you have a Butt at all the neck hole will be too small."
2.0,I was so excited to leave a 5 star review. When I put my cards in and opened the part to put money in underneath the id there was a hole there like it wasn't made properly. So now I am very disappointed.I would not.buy.again
2.0,This seller has very inconsistent quality. The first time I got this it lasted me almost a year. The last one I got broke after 2 wears. I will not buy again.
2.0,"Watch might be good.  It looks good and works for now.  However, the pen was not put together right when it came out of the box.  When you try to pull the cap off the pen opens up like you were trying to change the cartage.  It almost always opens this way.  It is just flimsy."
2.0,"I am generally a small in underwear, seeing some people say these ran small made me order mediums. When I tried them on, they were still tight, I like the look, but the waist band is too tight."
2.0,"The shirt arrived one size too small, and the shorts are absolutely huge.  I'd guess they are 2 sizes too large."
2.0,"I bought this necklace as a gift for my mother, but was disappointed when I saw it.  It looked bigger and much more detailed online than in person.  It is overpriced, for the actual look, but hasn't broke yet, so I gave it 2 stars.  I would steer clear of this one."
2.0,it was WAY more sheer than I thought it would be. and a little to small too I was disappointed.
2.0,"The material quality was okay but the size is more like a large, it was to big. The color is not has rich as the one that you show."
2.0,I don't like the polyester... prefer cotton!
2.0,Does not seem to be a genuine Nike product. Sizing is enormously &#34;off&#34; from Nike sizing. Quality seems fair to good. But the sizing is way off - a legit Nike jersey is Small = 8. This is Medium = 5/6. That is NOT how Nike sizes their youth clothing.
2.0,"Meh. SO disappointed. I was so excited for this jacket. I'm 5'11, 135lbs and this jacket in a size large (!!!) is way too small in the shoulders for me. Like, the shoulder seam did not land in a flattering way at the end of my shoulder, but rather two inches up from that. The measurements listed on the page did not match the item I received, by about an inch. Measure your shoulders before purchasing this. Due to the shoulders being so narrow, the sleeve started up on my shoulder and resulted in short sleeves. Not cute. The sleeves ended like two inches above my wrists. That is pretty typical because I'm tall, but if the shoulders actually fit, the sleeves would actually be plenty long.<br /><br /> I saw this jacket at a local store called Jeans Warehouse for the same price, so I think the price is okay. However, after beginning my refund process, i also discovered two holes in the inner lining of the jacket, about golf-ball size. These holes were not up at the top where my shoulders were tight. They were near the midsection of this jacket, so I think the sewing is just low quality. BUT, that being said, if this jacket fit, I would have kept it, because it's super cute."
2.0,Not matching size  as described
2.0,"Gorgeous dress. USED ITEM!! Don't know what's worst... The person who wore this dress, sprayed perfume all over it then returned it or the person who works at Amazon who packaged this dress and sent it to another customer USED. Gonna try to buy another one that's not used. 🙄"
2.0,It arrived to me in poor condition. Many of the zippers are stuck or broken. Its actually much lighter when it arrives. It is a beautiful purse but poorlg made. I don't recommened.
2.0,Nice looking order a larger size
2.0,Like the watch but the band broke already. Everyday use
2.0,Would have given a 5 Star rating had it been a larger size.
2.0,Doesn't go with many things.
2.0,They are very uncomfortable
2.0,fits too tight.
2.0,"It was cute. However , it did not provide much support for someone with a large chest ."
2.0,"Item was purchased as recommended for the sterling silver heart necklace.  No directions were included for placement on necklace & 1st day worn it was gone, DISAPPOINTING!"
2.0,way to big/over sized
2.0,The material is not as described. It’s a shiny silky material and not cotton.
2.0,Se le callaron dos piedras el primer día
2.0,I loved it but it stretched out to the point where the arms reach my knees :(
2.0,"Tasted slightly fruity but also terrible. Thats just my opinion, you're welcome to make your own, I did enjoy the novelty of having it though."
2.0,Style isn’t beautiful at all 👎🏽
2.0,"I went with the Amazon recommendation based on reviews of people of the same height and mass. I should have just gone with my feeling of XL. I don't like shirts tight in the chest. While the rest of the shirt fits great, it is too tight around my chest for my liking."
2.0,I love the product.... The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because I was u der the impression I was getting a 3 pack of rings and not just a single ring. It doesn't specify either way so I went off the picture....
2.0,"I had high hopes it would help organize my bag, but it's basically just another thing in my bag that takes up space.  Because of it's rubbery texture (designed to keep things in place) it's a 2-hand job to pull out or put anything away.  Overall, just not that useful."
2.0,very small! looks like they are for a child.I'm normally a size 4 and couldn't get them up my leg.
2.0,"Too long for a small frame, not a quality material"
2.0,"THET RUN VERY SMALL.I COULD NEVER USE THEM,AND I BUY EXTRA LARGE..."
2.0,"I should have returned it, barely fit over my head,  if I squeeze it over my head and wear it as a gaiter the cat can't be seen.I might have done better by cutting the leg off of a pair of pants."
2.0,Rings faded fast. In like 2 weeks fast.
2.0,"I was really hoping this too would be all I expected. Sadly it wasnt and I sent it back.The fit was off. The too part didn't stay in place around the bust; it set above the bossom. I do have large breasts so that may have been a favtor, I don't know. The color was on point. The fabric was soft but not as flowy as I would have liked."
2.0,Soft and great.  A bit too big
2.0,I absolutely loved this shirt when I wore it the first time..... ended up RIPPING before the day was over. Was upset!! You can tell it was poorly sewn.
2.0,"They had so much potential.......<br /> They color is beautiful.  The waistband pulls in your waist but the rest of the pants are a little too ""soft"".  The ""shaping"" design under the butt seem to be set too far off to the side making my butt look strange and there is no ""lift"" factor at all."
2.0,"Wish I could give this dress 5 starts because it really is beautiful. But, the torso part of the dress is made wayyy too long! the part that is meant to go on the chest ends up at the waist line! I had to return both dresses I bought."
2.0,"The jacket is actually nice, UNFORTUNATELY the sizing is WAY OFF.  I usually wear a M so I ordered an L, it was TOO small.  I then ordered two more jackets an XL and an XXL, and both were still TOO small, they fit very tight across the back by the shoulders.  I was tempted to keep the XXL but the lining was not cut properly on the right sleeve, which made the lining extend out the bottom of the sleeve. :-(  Sadly, the sizing of these jackets does not match what they say."
2.0,Doesn't work for comfort against steel toe boots. Doesn't cover both toe knuckles on longer toes.
2.0,The colors look nothing like the picture and is way too big!!<br />Unfortunately the date to return came faster than I realized so it sits here.<br />Very Disappointed
2.0,The writing does not show much. It is nothing like the description says. Not neon. Not visible.<br />I would not recommend this product.
2.0,"One thing I didn’t like is the return policy .. you can only send back to a kohl’s store , they do not take it at UPS store ..  which sucks as I don’t live close by a store so I have to pay to have it returned .. ALSO if you need 34 length pants these run short . I’m 5ft 9 women and have long legs and they were short on me .:"
2.0,Too big and looks nothing like the picture
2.0,"Love the shirt,  but it is cut very small :("
2.0,"Looked nice new and fit as expected. However first wash and it’s falling apart. Super sad. My son loved it. Maybe wash it with a small delicate load, inside out. I washed it normal and needed to get mud out of it from a day of trail riding."
2.0,"Material is not at all what I expected. It’s soft enough, but doesn’t feel like cotton, feels like nothing but spandex. Feels like it would be hot to sleep in too. The print on the shorts I received was shoddy, had some weird transfer. Wanted to like these becuase they are super cute, but decided to return as I am not happy with them. Size was good following the provided measurments."
2.0,2 stars because they appear to be nice until you actually feel them and try them on. They are made very cheaply and are very loose. I have a BIG head and they still fell off my face. I returned these and got a refund.
2.0,I wear a 7 1/2 shoe and these socks proved to be too big even after washing. My feet slipped around inside the socks a lot while doing barre exercises.
2.0,"Loved it, then discolored . and  tore  I had to throw it out .  So sad bc I loved it , my husband surprised me with this lovely gift"
2.0,"When I got these I loved them, comfy and flattering (show my assets very nicely). Fortunately, I wore them at home not work because they are see through enough that when I caught myself squatting in front of a mirror I could see my black thong! I ordered a size larger than I needed so they wouldn't be stretched as thin but it didn't work, guess I have a new pair of house pants. There is nothing fleece lined about these except they are soft so if you are looking for something warm and thick keep looking!"
2.0,"Smooth leather. No annoying logos.<br />After 3 months of use, the edges of the leather have turned white where the finish has worn off."
2.0,"At the same time I also tried a two-pack of the Calvin Klein V-neck stretch cotton shirts. The Klein shirts put these to shame, and cost slightly less than these did on sale.<br /><br />The Klein shirts are more luxurious and better tailored / styled. The fabric of the Klein shirts are softer, yet thicker. The V-necks of the Majdell shirts plunge, in my opinion, too low. And simply don't look as good overall. The Klein shirts are tailored so that your biceps are accentuated. Whereas, the Majdell sleeves hide part of one's biceps, with the net effect of making them look smaller.<br /><br />The two-pack Klein shirts at $32 works out to $16 per shirt.<br /><br />I'm 6'2"" with an slim athletic build and six-pack."
2.0,Needed $200 in alterations.  Looked like picture.  But made cheaply with no reinforcements
2.0,"These are adorably cute, but much much smaller than the picture. They are about the size of a pinky nail."
2.0,I really like the material. It’s so soft. The color is nice and black and it’s not very sheer. The issue is that the back is very loose and hangs off the body. It doesn’t touch my back. It’s not snug to my back. There’s lots of excess material that hangs in waves away from the body. If that one problem was fixed then I would really love this. Maybe if the band that’s at the bottom can be more stabilized so it doesn’t hang away from the back.
2.0,"The frames feel chintzy/flimsy; hollowed out dull grey low quality plastic. I purchased 2 pairs as I expected much better quality and wanted a backup pair..you can't drive in SoCal without good polarized eye protection from the chronically bright sun here. One of the hinges made a cracking sound when I opened the ear piece up to try on...that was the determining factor for me! I don't think they would last long with repeated opening/closing and use. The lenses did seem of good quality though, but the quality of the frames was disappointing...Returned."
2.0,Loved these readers and I bought two sets at two different times last year.  4 out of the 6 pairs have broken after only 3-5 months of very occasional use!  And the glasses broke in different areas - bridge of nose and ear piece.  Bummer cuz they were great while they lasted. :(
2.0,"So, this is a decent enough hat, but so many reviews are misleading.<br />This is a child's hat, the sizes are in children's sizes .<br />As long as you're aware of that, you will probably be pleased with it. Maybe I misread the description, but I bought this hat for a grown woman and when I received it I laughed at how tiny it was. It's a pain to try and return something, so I'll just be donating it to a student from my classroom."
2.0,waaaay too small.
2.0,"I have request a refund for this item. It looks different in the picture. It doesn't look like a luggage. It looks like a woman's purse. If you are a man you can not use it. And when is hang on your shoulder, you look like a lady.  Honestly I just wanted a little travel bag, but it doesn't look like a travel bag, not for man. Also, is smaller than 14&#34;<br />I could recommend for one day trip but for woman."
2.0,Came in a cute box nicely packaged and everything but a little smaller in person and I can't get it to straighten out or lay right so I'll be returning.
2.0,I waited a long time for these to be delivered. They are dull and not at all pretty as pictured.
2.0,Cute pattern. Poor quality fabric. Polyester. You get what you pay for...
2.0,Just doesn’t feel like the real thing.  I gave it to my grand daughter to knock around in. Didn’t fit me right. Nice shirt. Just didn’t fit me.
2.0,"Stabs you, not comfortable at all"
2.0,"Cute jacket but there is NO way this is a Winrer coat.  We’re in Texas, so I’m ok with thin, but this is nothing more than a windbreaker.  There is almost NO filling inside the coat at all.  This is little more than a windbreaker.  It’s also made in China, so I really question the cruelty involved in acquiring the duck feathers.  Will definitely be returning!"
2.0,"Cute necklace, easy to attach pictures. It did not hold together very well though. This is probably not for daily use, but more of a special item. One arm held, but the other was loose & wouldn't clasp. The loose arms broke off after 2 days unfortunately."
2.0,table cloth material
2.0,"Lovely little bag but dimensions are not as advertised. The bag is 6.25 inches, not 6.5 tall, but even that measurement is only from the top of the closure. It does NOT hold an iPhone 6 unless you leave the top unclasped. Wish the product description had been clearer."
2.0,"I love the color and the look of the dress... but that’s pretty much it. I’m 5’10”, 225# and ordered the XXL. I could have easily fit into a L. The material is thick and stretchy, but it feels strange to the touch.  I thought it would be appropriate for a cocktail party, but the fabric is much too casual.<br /><br />Highlight: the off the shoulder styling is wonderful and the dress hits right at the knee."
2.0,"first of all it looks really nice and the material is very good, but the size is awful! its too narrow and short the return fees will cost more than its original price :@"
2.0,"I liked the look of the item, but very uncomfortable to wear. Metal digs into your skin when you sit down. Asleep doesn’t tighten enough.  Would no recommend."
2.0,"I purchased 400 finger lights and ended up having to test each one.  I have approximately 100-150 of them that don't work at all or seem to have been put together in a hurry, loose parts, etc.  Haven't gotten back with seller yet as my schedule has been crazy, but I am hoping they will replace all that don't work."
2.0,"The skirt fit as expected but it was too short. The pictured length is a bit misleading. I know it said mini but if you have any sort of hips or behind, you should definitely be prepared to pair it with some tights."
2.0,Cute but VERY thin.
2.0,"The dress could have had potential but the fabric is very thin, shear and just cheap looking. It is very bad quality."
2.0,Nice styling and length but runs small. Have to return.
2.0,"Ordered a large  based on size measurement.  Chart measurement is definitely misleading. Fitted  liked  an xxxl.  Very, very disappointed, and does not recommend."
2.0,"VERY SMALL. I ordered up a size because in the pictures the shirt looks skin tight. I ordered a large, I usually order medium. It fits like a small. I'm trying to stretch it out a little, to no avail.  It's cute but way too small."
2.0,"just trying to push button through strap is very hard! haven't even tried it with a strap & on guitar, thinking right now its not useable for me. may try cutting slot a little longer?"
2.0,"I wanted to like this kick-around so much.  I initially bought this because it was advertised with an NH35 movement.  This watch comes with a Miyota (citizen) movement, not a great movement in my opinion compared (seiko) NH35 movement.  The second hand stutters at times.  As far as the the case and bracelet, they are really nice with a milled clasp on the bracelet.  The case is nicely made with nice finishes and a nice synthetic sapphire crystal.  I'll wear it for a bit but I know the Miyota movement isn't as reliable as the NH35."
2.0,"I want so badly to love this swim suit!! I’m a mom of 2 under 2. My body has been through hell and I have not started losing any baby weight yet! I’ve had c sections for both so I have this wonderful scar and belly flap. I don’t know if I ordered too large or too small. The top fits ok. I am too heavy DD. So it needs to be tightened to keep the ladies from falling out. The bottom. I really don’t understand. So the back fits like a thong and I don’t get it. The front when I try to pull it up so it’s more comfortable there is a gap between my groined and my leg. You can literally see my belly rolling over my c section and like I said the back does not cover my butt. So it’s not comfortable. So it almost seems like the top is too small possibly and the bottom is maybe too big?? I’m 5 foot, 175 lbs, DD, no butt, and a mom of 2 babies. This did not work for me unfortunately. Still considering what to do with the bathing suit! To exchange? Return? Or keep my search going!"
2.0,Nice fit but ears look stupid. I cut them off and sewed it shut. One was huge and the other was really small.
2.0,I like the product but the hat shipped in a flat envelope and was thereby wrinkled and deformed. I put it on my iron board and the heat got the wrinkles out but exterior text turned out to be a sticker which came off under the iron. Still love the hat but your shipping department really screwed up.
2.0,"While this watch is decent, it doesn’t have the same value as other Chinese watches priced around $120. In fact, it’s more like a $35 watch, which is how much it costs if you buy direct. So right off the bat, I wonder why the $83 markup. If there is a difference between this and the same model number direct from the maker, the listing needs to explain what it is. The listing also says that it requires batteries, which of course is wrong. And while we’re talking about the listing, in one place it says that the crystal is sapphire, and in another it says Hardlex, which is a Seiko trademark for their proprietary mineral glass. My money is on it being mineral crystal, which is neither Hardlex nor sapphire.<br /><br />Let’s talk about the good: according to my timegrapher, the movement is very accurate, coming in at about +10 seconds a day average, depending on position. With cheap automatic movements, you get what you get. You could be lucky, you could be unlucky. I got lucky. Also good, the bracelet has solid links, though the end links are hollow. The center links are polished, and side links brushed, which to me looks cheap, but it could be just the ticket for people with other perspectives. As far as removing links, the watch comes with a little poker, and poking out the pins was easy and satisfying. Once again, the bracelet (not the clasp) is pretty good.<br /><br />Another good thing is the display back. I love seeing the movement, which in this watch is very utilitarian looking, except for the nicely decorated rotor. The movement, by the way, hacks and hand winds, but is a low-beat movement of only 21,600 bph. Not a big deal though.<br /><br />Here’s what you don’t get that you often find on Chinese watches in this price range from companies like Pagani Design (which is by all accounts the same company as Benyar); for starters, the clasp is crude and primitive compared to other oyster-style bracelets they make which emulate the Rolex glide lock. There is no micro adjust function and no half-links, so sizing is not very fine-tuned. Also, for the money, you often find the links in the bracelet are screwed. Not here; it’s a simple pin setup. But, to be fair, the bracelet is comfortable and serviceable.<br /><br />While the case is shiny and silvery, it does not appear to be stainless steel. Upon close examination, the surface of the case looks wavy and uneven, and I can only conclude it’s chromed brass or other base metal. Or maybe it’s just badly finished stainless. Not great. The bezel feels cheap and hollow, about the way bezels on $35 watches feel. There is back play in the unidirectional bezel to the tune of about four minutes, rendering the thing more or less ornamental. The whole thing in the hand is a little rattly, with a very audible rotor swoosh sound, in keeping with what you get from a $35 to $45 watch. The bezel insert, by the way, does not appear to be ceramic, as it is on other watches like this that cost this much. Rather, the bezel insert appears to be aluminum. The crown, by the way, is unsigned. It’s not a big deal, but another sign this watch is overpriced compared to what you can get.<br /><br />Another disappointment is the lume. If you think the numerals 12 and 6 contain lume, so did I. But nope. Only the circular hour indices and the hands contain any lume, which is a lot less fun than it would be otherwise.<br /><br />Finally, there’s the fit and finish, which is good for a $40 watch, but does not seem good enough for the price being asked. The end links where they meet the case have uneven gaps that look less than magnificent.<br /><br />Lest I sound like I just hate Benyar, I should disclose that I have reviewed other Benyar watches that I loved. I think what happened here is the wrong price somehow got attached to this product, and it should be fixed."
2.0,"The gem is lovely, and the chains seem to be good and sturdy, but....<br />~the clasp is on the left, so makes it kind of difficult for a righty (but not impossible)<br />~not suited for thicker necks (it is a choker, and chains are metal and therefore do not stretch)<br />~chains tangle easily. even when wearing they don't all stay in their own section. spent half hour untangling it to put it on, and had to tape it to the table 'cos it kept tangling back up. (done; too much of a hassle)"
2.0,I have ordered fleece lined leggings before and these ones don’t have fleece. They do not keep your legs warmer during colder weather as others I have purchased. Do not waste your money if you looking for something warmer
2.0,"Cute bag, but the top part that is supposed to be the perfume top is floppy. The material should have been stiff. The bag packaging it was in didn't help. Also, the bag is way too small to fit my phone in, but that's my fault for not checking the dimensions. Ordered 2 colors and will likely return"
2.0,"This item look beautiful, but you need to buy another chain as look too tiny to match this pendant. as mentioned was came with beautiful  wooden box.but with paper box."
2.0,"It's a beautiful dress & for me true to size, but the side had about a 4&#34; rip, so I need to return it, and now i don't know if a new one will arrive in time so that I can wear it to my daighter's baby Dedication this weekend"
2.0,Cost was very thin and a 3x fit like a large
2.0,"I really loved the way this dress looks, but if you have a bigger chest than a DD, don't order it.  The material is stretchy, but does not cover a busty chest. This dress is definitely worth it, just not for very busty women."
2.0,Will shrink and fade within one wash. But it was really cute when it arrived.
2.0,Unfortunately I didn't read the dimensions.  I thought from the picture that this was purse size and able to stand up on its own.  This is more the size of a beach weekend tote bag and I don't think it will stand up on its own.  Very disappointed since I almost never use bags this size.  The picture made it appear much smaller.  Also I expected a sturdier bag since in the photo it was standing on its own.  Doesn't look or feel like a high-quality bag for the price.  Will be returning for refund.  Also no packing slip enclosed so more work to get this ready for return.
2.0,The size is to small it is 11.5 I requested size 13 .it is a present for my niece I need to return it does not fit on her
2.0,Buttons where broken when it got here
2.0,"My husband is 6 feet & 250 lbs and the larges size was still to small, when he is normally only a 2XL. Definitely made for a skinny, tall man. Not a big guy 😂"
2.0,Cheap made never got it to work. Do not waste your money or time.
2.0,Nice jacket for price but came with dirt on it!
2.0,Generalmente compro en amazon y la talla se ajusta muy bien a mi cuerpo. Esta blusa viene muy pequeña y hasta me llegó  sin la etiqueta.
2.0,The W was puckered I was disappointed.  I didn't return it because I needed a shirt for super hero day at school.  Luckily I was able to turn the shirt inside out and iron out most of the puckering.
2.0,Jacket looks nothing like that. Pant was tight everywhere but in the waist. Color looks different also. Don't like the material. Large.<br />5'6 170lbs
2.0,They screw to far in instead of onto. It takes away a lot of stoage space
2.0,Color was okay.  Very thin fabric.  Runs small.
2.0,"I expected this possibility but these look super cheap. I am only using them for a family photo though so it doesn't much matter but these will never be worn in public, haha."
2.0,Beautiful but broken after second use. The backing is made of unreliable material. It is sad because the stone is beautiful.
2.0,"This is the only charm I received from this buyer that was cute, smooth, and in good condition other than the clasp was welded shut. But since one of the charms was so bad I just swapped the clasp."
2.0,Way to small per the sizes it indicates.  Washed it in very cold water and air dried it flat and it shrank even more
2.0,"It states it is a 3x but it runs small. I like the dress but I cannot wear it, until I lose some more weight."
2.0,"I love the bag, but the handles are about to break so I had to stop using it."
2.0,White has a pinkish hue. So sheer it needs a slip. Fits well yet looks terrible-fabric highlights every flaw. Dark color would be better.
2.0,"hoping I can shrink this, ordered a medium and was way too big and baggy, should have ordered a size smaller. 5'5, 125lbs. giving two stars for cute design and decent material. arrived sooner than expected."
2.0,"not bad for the price, except that it got loose and fell off the first night I used it."
2.0,Purchased a 2XL short and it is too small
2.0,"I really wanted to love these. I’ve been searching for workout shorts in this fabric for so long, but these were a big disappointment. They were snug in weird places and very loose in others. They were snug at the bottom of the legs and the top of the waist, but super loose in the stomach. Not flattering. For those that are short and curvy, no good. The top of the “waist” went all the way up to my bra line."
2.0,the product is lovely- unfortunatly the neck piece came apart-very disappointed
2.0,"This is the wrong photo for the item i brought. Not sure why that mask is there. I purchased mouth guards for my masks, they are useless because they dont hook onto the mask the way you'd think. The hooks are in the wrong places so they dont fit all masks. In fact I have 4 different mask shapes and it didnt fit any of them. I tossed them in the trash. Nice try, consider reshaping the guards to fit the standard cloth mask every one is selling."
2.0,"Super cheap fabric, was suprised hyow big it was for what I expected to be &#34;Asian&#34; sizing. it wasn't terrible, but ultimately I didn't like the cheap look of this."
2.0,Gorgeous earrings but THEY ARE VERY VERY SMALL. ( The picture is deceiving) The backs were very loose (didn’t stay on the back of the earrings) they fell off onto the street and I lost them. I had to buy plastic backs.
2.0,I am donating to the homeless instead of returning. I chose the wrong size.
2.0,"Too small. Caution : color red is not actual color. Much more dull than vibrant. Was going to return, but will cost more postage than worth it. Most likely going to be a Purple Heart donation."
2.0,They are small and fall off much more easily than more expensive pairs. Not worth the savings
2.0,Poor quality not a good gift.
2.0,"It's cute, but there's a &#34;Drive In&#34; sign on your butt.. Think about it.. Really? Not a good message, especially since, it's so small. Not a good message."
2.0,"These are about what you'd expect for the price, except the 'fringe' part is kind of sparse, so there aren't very many strands at the ends, which looks funny. I kept them, but never wore them since they look kind of 'less than'. I wish I would have just returned them."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Must size up for it to look like the model pictured
2.0,"I only gave this two stars because of several reasons. What the heck is &#34;Viscose&#34;? Well, I found out it is a form of Rayon. There is no info on the product label as to care - nothing! So, moving on. Many people mentioned that the top runs small - NOT! I wear a large to XL and ended up buying an XXL - way too big. Another thing is that the junk piece of &#34;jewelry&#34; if you want to call it that does not match the picture. More than likely I will take the bead pieces apart and make a different piece of jewelry for myself."
2.0,I have a hard time with the zipper on this coat after using for 6 months.  The zipper just stopped catching and the cuffs around the wrist are too tight.  Please make a better coat.
2.0,Great pants for skinny/slim women. I have thick legs and a butt. They did not lower or rides up when I bent over but they are too tight on legs.
2.0,"Really unhappy with wait time to receive the product and disappointed with the fact it doesn't come with spring bar pins to hold it on the watch.  Now I have to go to a jewelry store to get those, where I could have gotten this exact band for the same price."
2.0,I have return these slippers as they were sized at large up to size 12. There is no way they could be a 12.
2.0,My grandson tried it on and didn't like it immediately.  Guess his foot was too chubby for the way the strap went around his foot.  Uncomfortable.  I thought it would be good because it was lightweight and looked like it would be great for the beach or casual wear.  But he wouldn't wear it after the first try.  Too bad.  Probably would be good for a child with narrower feet.
2.0,Already discoloring after wearing for a day and a half. Pretty bummed.
2.0,They are very light and have already broken.
2.0,"At first, I loved these tops. Super comfortable and great for yoga. Not enough support for running or a workout, even with a small chest. After a month or two of wear, they started to lose their shape. Now, I can’t even do yoga in them for fear of having a nip hang out. And they have started to get baggy in strange places, like my lower back, which I tried to capture. It’s too bad I spent $60 on these and now after just a few months, they’re unusable. Wish I could return."
2.0,I HAVE VERY NARROW FEET AND FOR ME TO SAY A PAIR OF SHOES ARE EXTREMELY NARROW HAS NEVER HAPPENED. THESE FLIP FLOPS ARE LIKE SLIVERS AND HAVE NO SUPPORT. THEY ARE BEING RETURNED.<br />I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL SCOTT SANDALS IN THE PAST AND THESE ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THEY COULD PROPERLY FIT SOMEONE'S FOOT.
2.0,"I ordered three of these, pink, green, and white.  I’d give them 5 stars but the pink one had a hole in the pocket."
2.0,I got the smallest size and it's huge. And it look nothing like the picture
2.0,"I have one on my keys. The other I attached to my purse, within days it was gone. I'm very gentle with all of my things so I don't see how this happened. Its an alright product."
2.0,I didn’t like the way it fit
2.0,Bow tie and suspenders weren't matching. Not as good of quality as we hoped. But you get what you pay for
2.0,Size wasn’t what it should have been. 3x was like maybe a men’s large?
2.0,Bought as a gift for a little girl who wanted a Moana party.
2.0,"The suit is cute and flattering except for the fact the bust is extremely large! Its not just that the cups are large, they are spread so far apart. I feel like the cups were in my arm pits. If I were to get a suit that fit my bust, the bottom would be too tight. Very disappointing because I love the style!"
2.0,Nice but does not fit passt the first nucklels.
2.0,received it with the inner lining totally ripped out :-(
2.0,It's a nice necklace but the cross does not stay in the infinity part.  It comes apart and can fall off your neck.
2.0,Product quality is not good. The lace wasn't sewn on one side of the top. It would be cute if it wasn't for that.
2.0,"Seems like a nice shirt but the sizing is WAY off!!!! I am usually a medium, maybe a large. I ordered a large and there was no way this was going to fit!"
2.0,I am typically a size 7 for my ring finger I ordered a size 8 thinking it would fit my ring finger and or possibly another finger and this runs way small it barely even fits my ring finger.
2.0,Super cheap. 2 of them broke before we even got to use them. It's basically shoe laces with some rubber tips on it. The rubber pieces that attach to the glasses came off when we took gen out of he package. Boo
2.0,i wear a 2XL so I ordered 3XL. once they were washed there a little tight. Disappointed.
2.0,"i’ll tell you right now, there is no world where this is worth over 40 dollars. don’t waste your time"
2.0,"They are ok, but they don't look right on for some odd rease. I think that the lenses just look HUGE on!"
2.0,This shoe hurt my toes and flopped on my heels. Not sure if it was my foot or the shoe but they were returned the next day. Pretty shoes and seemed good quality.
2.0,"I bought these shoes for my husband.  The lace tightener broke the first time he tried to use it, but we didn't return them since he really needed the sandals that day.  The rest of the shoes disintegrated within a month of daily use; the soles peeled away from the rest of the shoes.  Also they gave him terrible blisters at first and then when they were broken.  I would not recommend these sandals."
2.0,"This is very tiny and very thin.  Good gift for a petite child, but don't expect much."
2.0,I really love the idea of this skirt- the execution is just a little off.  The material is stretchy - has a very shiny sheen to it and is really long.  It is not at all as form-fitting as it appears in the picture.  I am disappointed.  I have many pieces by this brand and normally love their stuff.
2.0,Sorry I had to put somewhat large but this is not the reason I gave it 2 stars.  The reasoning being it does not lift.  I am a size 42DD.. My babies were sagging and bouncing all over the place. Oh NO NOT having that for 19.99...I gave 2 stars because of the softness.  Im sending it back.
2.0,"Love the graphics on shirt and the shirt quality. Just too small, size up"
2.0,Doesn't work looks cool I guess?
2.0,Mine was broken when arrived didn’t get to use it
2.0,"Pros:  Very pretty. Zipper makes contents very accessible.<br /><br />Cons:  The crossbody strap was not included.  The inside is a Big Hole for your items to get lost--there is no center divider.  It is very heavy, and feels like plastic."
2.0,Too  tight for me
2.0,It is a nice looking band but the pink faded off SO fast. From the first wear. Super disappointed.
2.0,"My issues:<br /><br />1. They're smaller than I expected which is kind've okay, but I wish they were thicker at least<br /><br />2. The amethyst is unreasonably smaller than the clear quartz and rose quartz which I don't appreciate<br /><br />3. The rose quartz is so pale that you can't even tell it's pink<br /><br />So overall I'm disappointed. Doubtful I'd recommend or buy again."
2.0,This item came on time and looks and fits as described reason for 2 stars. However it came with a hole in the back of the material. I'm very particular with my clothing no matter how much I spend for it so I don't think I would be wearing this.
2.0,I wasn’t expecting that the first day I wore this shoe I would get callouses on the upper part of my foot. The material doesn’t give much and the front of the shoe is too narrow. I love the look and ‘potential’ of this shoe and therefore was very disappointed when I hobbled home after my first day wearing them and realized they are not for me.
2.0,to shinny show in the light
2.0,"The fabric was a bit thick, was hoping it was thinner and good for warmer weather. The color was off. Not what I was expecting. I would have had to iron it which was not something I wanted to have to do with these pants.  I didn't even try it on because I knew it was going to feel/look bad. It may meet your expectations. There is just one way to find out!"
2.0,I ordered the blue shirt and received the navy blue one. The material did look nice and shipment was fast. So I'm hoping to get that shirt back for my husband by Easter. Fingers crossed.!
2.0,I bought this for my granddaughter it is perfect for her. She is still young and not ready for gold or silver yet. This necklace was very nice
2.0,"Front hangs open , fit runs small."
2.0,Bow came off on the first wear
2.0,Dress fit me lovely but the matching dress for my daughter was not included. I was refunded but disappointed. Cute dresses
2.0,Extra large did not fit
2.0,"the fabric pattern of this dress is great, but it is so huge and shapeless that it looks ridiculous when worn. I will either try to tailor it to give it some shape, or else use the fabric to make something wearable."
2.0,Nice style.<br />Size was way off.<br />I'm xlg.<br />Bought xlg had to return it.<br />Bought xxlg. Had to return that one too.
2.0,This is a Sweat suit for children and the zipper is on the wrong side for men....so men say!
2.0,I ordered a large and it was at least 2 sizes small for me. The cups in no way shape or form would have covered large c-dd breasts. Really was not as pretty in person as I thought it would be. Material seemed good enough quality though!
2.0,Much Smaller than expected.
2.0,Cheap. took forever to come. Get what you pay for.
2.0,Love the design and the color<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />The stone is loose and feels like it could fall out.<br /><br />Going to try and return it.
2.0,As far as construction goes it is mediocre and the walls of the purse are extremely thin so my guess is that any kind of weight is going to pull through the walls and tear the handles.  There is a pocket zipper on each side of the purse and one of mine sticks very badly but I am going to retain the purse because on days that I don't need to carry very much it will look okay but on days that I work and I have to carry a lot of things in my purse which is 5 days a week I'm not going to be using this purse.  I ordered the burgundy and it's an okay color.  I'm indifferent as to the color.  I would say that for the money I spent I could probably go to a discount store and find the same thing made much better for maybe just a couple dollars more.
2.0,"They came in a bag so were crushed and disfigured. The beadwork is just those cheap sticker sheet beads so half of them were peeling off when they came. Never could get them to bend to the right shape so I couldn't wear them to the event I got them for. The color and fit were spot on, that's why I gave them 2 stars."
2.0,Too small very thin. Crazy how expensive these Halloween costumes are. They couldn’t keep you warm for nothing. Was comfy.
2.0,"The fabric is sturdy which is important as I cook for a dozen or more people two or three times a week, and I wash my aprons after each use. But the size is not for a normal western woman. I am 5 ft. 135 lbs. and they barely fit me."
2.0,"Looked good, but rivet holding end of belt came out and belt fell apart within 3 months of original purchase"
2.0,"At first glance and use its a very cute simple wallet. The problem comes when you try to take out your cards. I only put a few cards in but getting it out was a nightmare, especially if they get pushed down deeper. My nails feel like they have been through a war zone. The middle part is also a headache in getting things out. It has a little pouch but since it’s so tiny and the hole is barely an inch or two, getting things out is not great. I suggest looking else where."
2.0,"the shorts are very bright and colorful, they are good apparence for swimming, but for me too small too tight, very good design."
2.0,"Gorgeous item, but unfortunately mine fell apart after the first wear."
2.0,"These worked pretty good for blocking blue light, but they were kind of ""extreme"" about it. I always felt a little disoriented with them on. But the worst part of it was the coating. I am not THAT hard on glasses (these were never in my purse -- they were always sitting on an iPad somewhere in the house), but these became so scratched/dulled up that they actually interfered with my vision while reading. I ordered 2 pair, and they are both like that now. I have many other pairs of readers -- some of which live in my purse -- and they aren't NEARLY as messed up as these are now. And I've only had them a couple of months.<br />Not recommended."
2.0,leaves black spots on your ears they are so cheap and don't look good at all.
2.0,"Looked great, but a little big. After one wash the tag frayed and was incredibly uncomfortable. After the second wash the crotch ripped out of one of the briefs. Haven't worn the other pairs yet but will update."
2.0,Cute Concept But Looks Tacky! Looks Copied Not What It Looks Like In The Picture.
2.0,This key chain has a great look but the pin came out of the bottom soon after I started using it. Would not recommend.
2.0,The fabric was uncomfortable and looked cheap
2.0,"I don’t know if these are real Clark shoes or not but they don’t seem like it. The leather is not good, the sole is glued on with a plastic bevel and they are not near as comfortable as the Clark shoes I have come to know over the last 20 years"
2.0,"I'm 5'3, 165 lbs and these fit so weird. No room in the butt, so if you have a larger rear end, these are not for you. Also, tight on the thighs. The crotch is low making the entire fit awkward. Seems like these only fit tall slim woman."
2.0,The zipper broke right away
2.0,Too Small and the material was see through.. So keep that in mind.
2.0,"Normally I’m size M, that’s the size I bought following the size chart, unfortunately the dress runs bigger, it’s too heavy and uncomfortable on the neck and shoulders."
2.0,Very strange fit... not for the busty gals.
2.0,"I ordered a 2 sizes larger than what I normally do, and I still don't like it. it is to short. The color and everything is very nice, but I don't like wearing short shirts, so unfortunately it is useless for me."
2.0,"I like the flexibility of the product and the polarization of the lenses, but these things are so loose fitting on my 4 year old BECAUSE of the built in flexibility.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to make them more snug, I'd consider adjusting the score, but as of now, these were a waste.  They don't even stay on my face."
2.0,I ordered a medium for my daughter and a 2xl for myself. They were the exact same size! The size on the pants say the correct size but they are the same size across when you hold them up together. She can perfectly wear both pair! The sizing on the larger sizes runs very same while the smaller sizes seem to run true to size.
2.0,"Bought this watch for my father for his birthday, unfortunately I received a defected item. Other than that it’s a great watch , will return and reorder!"
2.0,"Cute, but way too small. Thought I must’ve been sent the wrong size by accident, but both the box and the shoe itself show my size. Could barely stuff my foot into it. The toe area was extremely tight both on the sides and from the top. No way I could wear these comfortably, and sadly the next two sizes up are not available at the same price.  Also, as another reviewer indicated, there is no arch support. While that is understandable in this style of sneaker, note that the footbed is not removable so it would be difficult to add an insert."
2.0,Okay but not such good quality.
2.0,The case is around 1/2 inch wider than a credit card. These do not fit in a wallet.
2.0,You get what you pay for.. The material was too narrow on there bottoms.. They constantly pulling at the little bit of fabric for there bottoms.. I just can’t recommend them.. Not returning them because they where cheep but I will not buy theses ever again..
2.0,material was to fragile
2.0,"This is a beautiful product, but it runs VERY small."
2.0,The color was come off right away!
2.0,"Cute shirt but low quality fabric.  After two washes, downy and all, it is completely beaded up and faded and now relegated to lounging at home."
2.0,The product is much smaller than it appears.  The shoe polish containers are miniature so that it makes everything else appear larger...for those who know the size of normal shoe polish containers.  I was disappointed by the size.  The quality seems fine.
2.0,"Cute shirt and I liked it very much, but the XXL I ordered fit like a L. Seemed to be TWO sizes too small."
2.0,The fit was not true to size and for that reason I'm asking for a RMA to return it for credit. Please advise asap! Thanks!
2.0,"Beautifulllll watch... unfortunately, it doesn't stay clasped shut. Mine might have just been defective. Be careful it doesn't fall off your wrist and crack the glass face."
2.0,The fit wasn’t snug
2.0,"Top exposes everything! I purchased the red dress with flowers. The pattern was pretty, the material not great, but acceptable. The fit everywhere but the bust was great, but the V left it all wide open. Even with it pinned it just didn’t look right. Too bad because if it had been cinched at the bust I would have kept it, but it’s going back!"
2.0,Good boot oil just came in a oil soaked box so that wasn't fun
2.0,"uncomfortable, couldn't see. was"
2.0,Size was not correct.
2.0,Breast area is definitely too large. I felt like I was swimming in fabric.
2.0,"I was disappointed in this hat because it pops off the head so easily, unless you are just not moving at all.  It’s shallow and small-ish yet there was no mention about it being a teen size or anything!that would explain why it’s small."
2.0,fell off and lost one first time i used glasses
2.0,"I really liked my strap when it first arrived, they are very stylish! But as a started to use it, it became very apparent to me that is it very poor quality. My strap always falls off my sunglasses, and I even had a case where the strap popped out of the metal holder so I had to glue it back together. I would recommend looking for another strap that will not fall apart on you."
2.0,"Even though size says USA, it isn’t. Size 16 fits my youngest son who wears a size 10!  Not my older son who wears a 16!  Completely nuts!!"
2.0,The latch on the strap was defective but other than that it was what I wanted.
2.0,I wouldn't really refer to these as polarized! They were no different from my ordinary sunglasses. The bling is to real. Kinda cheap. Disappointed in my purchase!
2.0,"These boots are very poor quality (not surprised due to the price, but I excepted some comfort), and an ugly shade of baby poop brown/grey. NOT black."
2.0,"Very light watch but, it slide around on my wrist no matter how tight I get it strapped on. It's still cheaper than ordering the band alone."
2.0,Runs one size small.
2.0,A medium looks like a small
2.0,I like the fact that there were so many of them but they are super tiny and not made for my project I was looking for them for!
2.0,"Looks nice, but tie was difficult to loosen, zipper ripped tie."
2.0,A lot smaller than I thought. It looks something you would find at a cheap flea market.
2.0,Complicated
2.0,These did not work on my Harley
2.0,It’s just cotton and not plus size.  I ordered a 1x and got an XL.  It’s cute but not as nice as it appears in the photos and the size is wrong.
2.0,Too large and unflattering
2.0,Very disappointed. This onesie was huge. The leg opening was huge and I could probably fit my leg through it. I just stuck in my sins closet. I'm sure he'll never be able to wear it.
2.0,Was starting a project and while separating the large from small I notice a few had a green substance on them. Rubbing it off or even washing takes the original color with it. Then I poured the entire bag out to find 1/4 of the product had this green stuff all over it. Disappointed.  I was also gifted wood pieces- yarn and other small pieces of trash and I haven’t even went through it all yet.
2.0,This broke before one semester ever passed
2.0,Super hard to see the writing. Wouldn't even know it was there if I hadn't ordered it myself.
2.0,"Item arrived and the pearl and setting are nice. However, the included chain is silver not at all matching the gold setting. To make matters worse both ends of the included chain has loops that are too large to fit through the pendent making it not only a bad match but it is useless. Now I have to go purchase an additional chain before I can give this as a gift. Very unprofessional. I highly recommend taking your business elsewhere.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0759N5N9V Paialco Dainty 18k Yellow Gold Cultured Tahitian Black Pearl Pendant 9-10MM]]"
2.0,Cheap quality. Not bad for the price.
2.0,"I ordered a 3X. I wear a 20/22 women's  (USA sizes), these pants where to small through the legs, but fit at the waste.  I suggest ordering  1 or 2 sizes bigger..  There is a pull string at the waste.  They are long, not wide through the legs.  But I gave them away to my sister who is pretty much the same shape as me, just taller and they fit her well."
2.0,Way to small. Sent back and received credit within a couple of days.
2.0,Still to big for my head.
2.0,"The metal thread is too thick for me and it hurts to try to pull these through my ears. The pearls and flowers look big and gaudy to me, so I won't be trying to force these through my ears."
2.0,THERE 2 SMALL
2.0,Bought this for my daughter. She doesn’t like it. It’s a lot longer than in the picture.
2.0,"Very well made.... BUT it's listed as a men's coat and it's a women's zipper. NOT EVEN REMOTELY A NORMAL XL nevermind the 4xl it's listed as..... So, I guess it's mine now."
2.0,"Way, way too big!"
2.0,"Purse had damage to the leather?? that would have continued to get worse,  all zippers had to be zipped and unzipped several times to get them to work properly (all were gapped open in the middle when it arrived) AND it had the most horrible smell!  Otherwise, the size was good and it had ample pockets inside and a nice pocket outside.  The lining was very dark and it was hard to see things inside.  I returned it immediately and have received a full refund."
2.0,Bought this as a gift for mu husband but the magnet is weak the bracelet keeps falling from his wrist
2.0,"It's nice,  I was disappointed it came in the wrong color though.  I picked royal blue and got black."
2.0,Metal clip easily slips out of place when wearing
2.0,Love the style but runs small.
2.0,"I guess I did not read the description well.  They were fairly THIN cotton gloves.  I mean THIN.  I would have returned them but they arrived the day before we needed them.  Not happy with quality.  After one hour of wearing, they were stretched so far out of shape."
2.0,It's cute but doesn't look exactly like the picture.
2.0,I was very disappointed. I only had it for about 2 weeks and the strap that holds the end tight after you put it on ripped. Not worth the money and all.
2.0,"Just received today. Looks nice, but stones in the ring feel super rough. Worry that clothing is going to snag they are so rough and jagged feeling, and I can already see lint from my sweater being caught on them!I have another tigrade ring that doesn’t feel this way and is very comfortable to wear. Maybe this one is a defect... Debating return"
2.0,"So first, they got ""lost"", I was finally allowed to request a refund 4 or 5 days after they were supposed to have arrived which was issued quickly so yay for that I guess..but then they actually showed up and were too small. I made sure it wasn't me, I put on a few of my other size 7 rings to make sure my fingers weren't swollen and they all fit normally so these either run very small or were the wrong size. They're also not sturdy feeling but they do look ok, I'd wear them if they fit ::("
2.0,Grace karin clothes are expensive and very poor quality according to the price. Does not look what its in the picture.
2.0,This swim suit is still adorable but the color is a medium coal grey not black
2.0,"The fit is okay. Something about the collar portion doesn't seem right. The material is horrible, feels like plastic. Other than that, very cute."
2.0,"Had to return the dress, material is cheap and thin."
2.0,I like the style and coloring of these flip flops however do not like false advertising on stating it is leather when they are not + being marked up upon arrival.
2.0,"These bands are made well, however, they were too small for my wrists. Returned."
2.0,"The bottom stone on one earring fell out, so I removed it, and the one in the other earring.  They are shorter, but are in tact and natch."
2.0,"Loose and cheap material, not a nice snug fit.  Ok if you have an unusually large head"
2.0,"Returned, did not like the fit..."
2.0,"Love the color and design, however they are very uncomfortable stiff design. They were cheap enough that if they get lost or break it won’t be a big deal"
2.0,I really liked the dress. Fabric is thicker than expected. The straps are very thin. Wore 1 time and the strap broke.
2.0,nice dress. it didn't fit i returned it
2.0,Looked sheer and not comfortable
2.0,Kept coming Unclipped. Wasn’t worth the amount of money but was cute
2.0,"Bad fit. Too thick. Hard to put on and take  off. Bad construction, makes it hard to sit down."
2.0,These are very poorly made. Turns your skin green right away.
2.0,Cheap Fabric
2.0,Would Bea prefect jumpsuit but was cut too high for persons with a long torso.
2.0,Not very well made; made of inferior materials.
2.0,I would love this belt except it isn't white. It's more of a cream color even though it is listed as being white.
2.0,"Honestly, this was my favorite belt for the roughly ~4 1/2 months I had it. It fit great, looked great, and was extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, the belt did break on me at the office this past week, hence the lower rating."
2.0,"This dress is hilarious. I read the reviews before I purchased. SCOURED them.  I am super skeptical of dresses I purchase on amazon.  Most of the reviews talked about how well the dress fit.  NOPE.  I typically wear an 18 or XXL in dresses, and when I got this dress in, all my fiance and I did was laugh.  He even asked if it was mislabeled, or was meant for an American Girl doll.  TINY! At best it was a large. AT BEST."
2.0,Lycra is not like the picture
2.0,ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL
2.0,"Made cheaply. Honestly, don’t waste your money. The bows have a ton imperfections. Not very happy with these!"
2.0,Not made correct
2.0,"The earrings look so much better on the picture. When I got mine, one of the jewels was detached. The silver does not look like a silver to me. The material is too light to be a solid silver..."
2.0,"I wanna give this dress a five star honestly, but unfortunately I can only give it a two star. It’s so cute I love the stars & the moons flowing through the dress. It doesn’t look like the picture how it fits the model. The seams are oddly put together the bottom part go’s below my bum. It’s just oddly put together. For this reason I have to return it. But don’t want to because it is so cute, reminds me of a sailor moon dress. But just not flattering on it’s puffs up in the ruffle part below which makes me look big. I ordered a medium but I don’t think a small would have done it justice either. It is the make of the dress. I say, if you’re going to order, order a size up. That’s all she wrote."
2.0,"These are NOT &#34;easy on.&#34;  TOO narrow and poorly designed. They are very difficult for my almost 4 year old to get on. Waste of money.  They seem warm, so gave a start for that."
2.0,I really want to love this band. It is so pretty and would be absolutely perfect except the band does not want to stay connected to the Fitbit. It disconnects every time I try to take the watch off my wrist. Maybe it was a one off but I wouldn’t buy again to replace.
2.0,Very cheaply made. The heart isn't as big as it shows in the picture nor is the chain. The stainless steal looks like those fake material you buy off the street that would go black after wearing once. Totally disappointed.
2.0,I know this got great reviews but they just made my boobs look weird. The pads in the bra look like little dinner plates that are very visible in everything I tried on. Taking the pads out gives you no support and still makes your boobs weird but now they are just drooping. I returned them.
2.0,Cozy and warm but my size 6 foot has to tighten my feet muscles to make sure they don't fall off my feet.
2.0,"This watch is difficult to program, especially the alarms."
2.0,Idk what went wrong with the stitch on this. One wear and it busted from the seam. This pic  was taken after 8 hours of wearing
2.0,Hard to believe it’s 50 UPF+ because it’s very thin fabric. It’s transparent.
2.0,"The band is too large and too stiff, can't use.  I tried it one the watch for a week and it's too uncomfortable."
2.0,Are these pants made for kids? Sizing is way off I am 5’7 usually pants size 14.  These are nice looking pants bud would maybe a kid<br />Size is ridiculous small with no stretch.  Vendor of this product should change sizing details so people don’t waste their time and money ordering
2.0,"Not sure if they sent me the wrong pair or if the description is just inaccurate, but the pair that I received is much less than 2&#34; (a little less than 1.75&#34; at best) and definitely less than 3mm. Very disappointed and glad that I didn't have them sent directly to my friend (they were meant to be a gift because she loves my 2&#34; pair so much). These are headed back."
2.0,Strap broke after 6 months
2.0,"Ordered this cami after ordering same print from another vendor. Ordered Lg, didn’t fit over chest. Order xl from this company and it just doesn’t fit right. Too long.?hv to adjust strap to Mac tightness and doesn’t look sexy. Too long, too unflattering in bust. Sending back.  Not bad top if you’re in the right size bracket I guess!"
2.0,"Delivery was on time. The jacket is warm, lining is good, fur on hood is good, length is good, but it is very heavy and tight in the middle of the jacket. Also the arm pits or where the arms are attached into the body of the jacket are very tight (this is without a sweater, just a T-shirt on)<br />I am a women who is trying to buy a jacket but all the women's jackets are very small. I wear a medium and I am ordering large in women's and they do not fit. My friend said order a men's jacket which I wii be doing this coat  is not true to size."
2.0,"Image is too large, doesn't look anywhere near ""authentic""."
2.0,Nice shirt but runs extremely small.  The XXXL is like a regular large boys.
2.0,The band is very hard
2.0,cute pattern but runs VERY small
2.0,not very soft fabric at all
2.0,"I have struggled to like these boots but I dont. The size is right but they are hideously uncomfortable and if I tie the laces at all, the tongue fold cuts into the top of my foot and actually leaves my feet bleeding.. I thought they would soften up but I have worn them several times and they dont - I am trying to find out if they can be returned."
2.0,"Came damaged,the exterior looks good but mask is very thin and can be smashed and damaged easily."
2.0,I thought the cut and fit was off.  Returned.
2.0,So sad they are beautiful however we ordered 14/16 that is my granddaughter size and they are more like a 7/8.  We had to return them.  Very sad
2.0,"I have only had the pants 3-months, I wish they held up better.  When I received them one pair was a small and one was extra small (they were part of a package deal and supposed to both be smalls).  I coach at my gym, so I wear workout pants regularly.  I have only worn these 5-6 times and they are pulling loose at the seams (ankles & waist).  I don't dry my workout clothes and I wash them in cold water.  I have been recommending these to my athletes, but I am not sure I can continue to do so if they only last 5-6 wears.  :-("
2.0,"Pretty, non-tarnishing. But it was a lot smaller that I expected!"
2.0,Not very flattering. The shorts fit more like boy short underwear
2.0,The pair I received has both reindeer facing the same direction instead of opposite.
2.0,"I wanted to like this so much<br /> But it makes me look completely flat chested because I have a shorter torso and I think this would be better for someone a bit taller with a larger chest. I'm 5'4"" and a size ""B"". The fabric feels cheap. There were strings hanging off the back of the dress when I took it out of the bag."
2.0,This doesn't lay well leaving the &#34;gems&#34; laying on their side and not facing out. Was hoping for better quality than the typical teeny bopper stores at the mall but that's what this seems to be.
2.0,Little thin. You could see the pockets through the pants. And the pants seemed to be short.
2.0,not at all as pictured. shipping slow
2.0,"I bought a pair, and they broke in the first 2 weeks. I'm only giving 2 stars because the customer service was good the first time around replacing them promptly. The only problem... the replacement pair broke as well. Cheap, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Was shipped the wrong designs. Cute designs but not the ones I ordered.
2.0,The bottom fits perfectly. The top fits but its too big wish the size chart had x small sizing to mix and match bottom and tops for the bathing suit.
2.0,"They look good, but they a bit too dark for true Lapis lazuli, and they dyed my earlobes blue.<br />So..purchase at your own discretion."
2.0,"The dress shipped fast.  However, the dress fit too small.  I wear a size 16 and the XL fit too small.  The shoulders, arms, and chest were too small.  I am 5'8"" and the Empire waist hit awkward on me.  The length just barely even made it to my ankles.  Looked ridiculous.  My husband even said it made me look pregnant.  Definitely returning."
2.0,There’s an extreme difference between a size medium and large. I am 6ft2 and 185lbs so purchased both hoping that one would workout. Unfortunately this is one of the most ill fitting tank tops I’ve ever tried on. I even laid it out next to a basic Fruit Of The Loom Black tank top that I purchased from Walmart for only $4 and the Walmart tank is better quality than whoever this “Delta Pro Weight” company is that’s tagged in the neck of the tank. Also the neck hole is extremely small so it fits more like an awkward looking sleeveless v-neck tee than a tank. I would shop around for other options before purchasing one of these tanks.
2.0,The gloves were small
2.0,"The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because I did receive socks in a timely manner, but that's all<br />My positives. I ordered size 9-11 woman's. They barely fit my 9.5-10 feet and JUST make it over my heel. The fabric is so thin it is LITERALLY see through."
2.0,"One size fits all, huh? Didn't fit me, sorry. Too cheap to return."
2.0,Size ran smaller than actual stated size. Picture was decieving.
2.0,Pretty dress. You get what you pay for when it come to material. I received the wrong color. I am 5'6 and 115 lbs and a small was significantly too big.
2.0,The material of the dress is like spandex. It was very heavy.
2.0,Very cute swimsuit but the cups were entirely too small.
2.0,Really cute. I love how the tail swivels around and moves all the time. I only got to wear them a couple of times however. I dropped one of the earrings and one of the legs popped off and the body chipped. Can't be repaired. They're made of a clay or some kind of soft material.
2.0,The fabric is so thin that it is see-through.
2.0,Runs small..this shirt is very cheap..and not worth the money..I opened it..and the chains were broken..shirt was way smaller than pictured
2.0,"Very pretty but even though I tighten it, it constantly opens up"
2.0,"I like the cut of the dress and the colors are vivid, but 92% polyester.... also, small orange stains on the buttons."
2.0,Zipper broke after 2 weeks of use
2.0,"Really cute, but buttons fell off on first wear."
2.0,Doesn’t do big chunks of ice
2.0,"After I washed as directed, the pocket seam ripped. The hem seam came down and it ripped under the right arm while putting it on. It was on sale so I figured it might be defective. I weigh 114 lb. and it was a medium. I ordered a 2nd one by mistake and cancelled it but it was still delivered"
2.0,I had gotten a set before which were really good. But when I reordered as a gift to a friend (because she loved mine soooo much) they weren't the same. These other sunglasses didn't even have the Liansan logo on them and they weren't the same quality :(
2.0,"I bought this bag for a girls trip to Austin. I was going to use it as a carry-on/purse for a long weekend. I got it and was very pleased with how cute it was. Four days later, as I was carrying it, I realized the straw part of the bag was coming apart. It's split entirely on one side and will likely come apart the rest of the way, breaking off the bottom half of the straw bag. I didn't use it for anything heavy - I carried around a wristlet in side with my ID, cash and credit cards, a small hair brush and a book.<br /><br />UPDATE: They sent me a replacement bag and so far it is holding up.<br /><br />2nd UPDATE: The new bag is holding up very well! See added photo of the new bag. Excited to use this on an upcoming beach trip."
2.0,"This cami fits nice except it is very, very long.  I am tall and it is to long for me."
2.0,"These are super soft and comfortable, but I would not be comfortable wearing these outside of the house as they are rather thin. They show ever lump and bump you have and the lighter colors are worse. The black will still show panty lines and aren't very forgiving. These would be fine with a very long shirt or as sleep pants, but I will be not wearing them outside of the house. I bought them for yoga."
2.0,this item is not used for heavy usage. when going through multiple airports and traveling a lot i have to pull the handle up and down constantly. it got stuck and finally broke.
2.0,The wax used to form to teeth falls out so you only get about a two days wear out of them at the most... Have a pretty disappointed son now
2.0,Item did not look anywhere as nice as the picture so we went out and bought something else
2.0,Lets just say this product looks cheaper than in the picture. Its still cute but must be worn carefully.. i suggest this for small girls not teens
2.0,"I bought my usual size (46 F) for this bra and it was way too big. The underwire goes up so high that it digs into my underarm and is ridiculously uncomfortable.  I do like the feel of the fabric, but unfortunately I just can't wear it at all. I would have returned it, but didn't realize how painful it was to wear until I'd already removed the tags and worn it for a day. I wish that I had passed on this one and just stuck with the Motherhood ones. The Motherhood bras don't really last, but they're inexpensive and fit right."
2.0,This dress is like wearing a giant sack. Not flattering at all. Way too big and has weird ruching in back not shown in the pics. It would be more flattering in the front
2.0,"Does not fit like anything I was expecting, picture shows the side opening just under the bra, mine is pretty much at my waist."
2.0,Literally looks like someone just cut a hoodie in half.
2.0,"These run very small and are very scratchy. Hard to wear all day because they are not soft, even after a few washes. They are too tight and uncomfortable."
2.0,"Ended up returning. Was not as flattering as I thought it would be, and it wasn't as pretty in person as it was in the picture."
2.0,"This dress was too tight on my chest by miles and the cinch in the image is wildly inaccurate. It falls like a blanket over a mannequin. HOWEVER, that is a look I could deal with. No big deal. But, if you want what you're buying, I wouldn't recommend buying this."
2.0,The band is begging to fray.
2.0,"Ordered the blue one, fit perfectly.<br /><br />Ordered the exact same size in gray and it is way to big."
2.0,"Cute, but for a Barbie doll! I ordered the largest size & it still only looked like it’d fit a size 6. Bummer!"
2.0,These sandals look adorable and would be comfortable.  Unfortunately my daughter has very narrow feet and the sandals just wouldn’t stay on her.
2.0,Very cheap and hot material. When it arrived I actually LOL for real. I wasn't expecting high quality but they look like a were sewn by a 10 yro in someone's kitchen.  Don't waste your money.
2.0,Acute mask but it's too big for my children. It would fit better for a teenager or adult.
2.0,No me gusto lo devolví era muy transparente compre la cocción B
2.0,"Should not have bought them. Looking at the price point, I was not having high expectation. And the product arrived in rather shabby state. Two pair of earrings actually were bended. They looked beautiful but just not durable even on first try."
2.0,This bra is thin and not very supportive for bigger girls.
2.0,"Fabric was quite thin.  Not bad, for the price."
2.0,"these look and feel great, but an issue arose about a week after daily wear. one of the thin metal pegs which creates the hinge where the leather and watch connector meet (i hope i’m describing this well) got loose or something and started poking out the side. i tried fiddling with it but it would not stay inside, so finally i used some strong super glue to just glue the piece back in. a month later and it has held up so far, so if you have this same problem i would definitely try this! i’m not sure if mine were defective or if they broke somehow, but i’m gonna have to say skip these, or at least the color i bought."
2.0,"So disappointed when I received this sweater. It was shorter than pictured, and the colors were much brighter than also. I ordered the tan/khaki and gray in a size small and it was more of a caramel color and gray, and was quite large fitting I thought, and barely came to my knees and I am only 5'4"" tall. and usually wear a 2-4. I returned it as it just didn't do a thing for me, it was very boxy and not long and sleek like I thought it would be."
2.0,This robe was fine until I washed it.  Then it started thinning and there were straggly threads over it.  Was happy for awhile but dissappointed in how it washed up.
2.0,the dress came on time however the style was no good too old fashioned
2.0,"So thin, I was afraid it might break just touching it..."
2.0,Very pretty but arrived broken.
2.0,Some of the rhinestones fell out the first time I wore it.
2.0,"I don’t feel that the shoes are true wide size. Sometimes I buy wide sometimes I buy regular I can do either, but for work I choose wide so that they’re more comfortable to wear all day. These just don’t cut it. Hopefully I can wear them in easy."
2.0,"[[ASIN:B01KA5HFGQ Century Star Women Chiffon Batwing Sleeve Caftan Loose Tunic Top Blouse White]]<br /><br />This blouse is poorly made.  I couldn't get it over my head.  The neck hole is too small. Cheap, thin fabric. I don't recommend it. I returned it to Amazon for a &#34;full refund&#34; and I had No problems."
2.0,"I got an XL first which was too small and exchanged it for a 3-XL and it was still too small. These sizes are for Petite frames or teen sizing. If I were to get this for an adult I'd need a 5-7-XL. It looks amazing, if only it could be worn."
2.0,Small go 1 size up
2.0,This shoe is beautiful but one of them came with broken lighting button and just one of them it is ligthining up now. Very disappointed.
2.0,"I expected something advertised as ""over the calf"" to REMAIN 'over the calf'.  They serve as ankle warmers after a few minutes."
2.0,"Returned.  Too small, though it is size I usually wear.  Very short.  Color not the bright red I wanted."
2.0,Cute but for tall people it's not long enough at all
2.0,"Staring to rip in the center and it hurts behind the ears, too tight, with the beads at the very end."
2.0,One tie came off completely after the first wear. Fairly poor stitch quality.
2.0,Made fairly well.  Unfortunately been stored somewhere for a long time.  Leather is molded and brass hardware is corroded.
2.0,"The the particular red color of this dress, in combination with the pattern and quality of material, yields it loud without discretion."
2.0,"Arrived damaged, sent back."
2.0,"I ordered 5X. It may be 5X in China, but it’s not even 1X here in the USA."
2.0,This dress is not for anyone with a chest!! It is SO small on the chest and arms. I am so disappointed. I usually wear a 2x-3x.  I was literally stuffed into the 5x. Bummed. Returned.
2.0,I liked the style and color of this coat but the size was too large and I had to return it.<br /><br />After two previous coats that were too small I went to 'plus' size coats to find one that wasn't tight in the shoulders and I could wear sweaters under.  This one was too large  so I returned and ordered a smaller size one.
2.0,"Washed before wearing, and it shrunk up so much, it’s useless. I loved the blue color and was ready to use the soft robe immediately. It’s so short now though! Doesn’t cover anything from the shower back to my room. 😕"
2.0,I had high hopes for this dress but as soon as I pulled the dress out of the bag my fingers felt the disappointment that was coming. The material is a scratchy material that some heap bandannas are made out of and the seam is unfinished making it look really cheap. The worst part was that this is supposed to be an A-line dress but in real life the material is so cheap that it does not flare out like an A-line but instead it clings to your body and makes you look strange.
2.0,Runs much smaller than other CRZ Yoga products. Fit pretty strangely. The cinched sides make it lay unevenly and look pretty lumpy. I was altogether unimpressed and sent it back.
2.0,"These are very silky and comfortable, but they won't stay on my head during the night."
2.0,Size One Size fits All which usually runs medium/large in the US but this sweater runs XX SMALL...unfortunately my medium sized kid didn't try it on right away & we missed the return window. I will say quality seems good very well made.
2.0,"This product was a great idea, but the portion that covers the ball of the foot isn't long enough."
2.0,I was very excited to receive these glasses but when I tried them on I was very disappointed. They were slanted and I was unable to put them on because one part of the frame was closed so tight that I was not able to wear them. I was sadden I couldn't keep them as I instantly fell in love with this style but unfortunately I received a defective pair of glasses :( and was force to return them.
2.0,this product is to small to use as a real coin purse or wallet unless it is used for a child.  It also was defective like something had melted on the back of it.
2.0,Very cute but fell apart after a week. Bummed out
2.0,"Product was not as big as I would have liked. They are heavy, and extremely hard to put on. I am giving them to a friend who can use them and liked them. I will try again and purchase a larger size. Overall, it is a good product, well made."
2.0,"The fabric is very soft and the color is nice, but it came with a large snag in the side. The quality is not great. It is also very small. I ordered the largest size and it's still tighter than I like. I normally wear a medium, so it runs extremely small. I have to wear it with a jacket or another sweater anyway, so it's not that big of a deal, but if you aren't a 2 and want it to hang like a dress, it's not going to happen. But it is very soft and I do love the color. I'm very sad, because if it had been more like the picture, I would have ordered another."
2.0,Terrible chemical smell. Returned
2.0,"Im 5’3, 160 lbs, 36DD and despite ordering the XL. Fits like a medium and it’s not long like in the picture. Hits right at the hip bone for me, which should say a lot considering I’m already pretty short. Material is thin, but soft. I can only surmise that it would shrink in the wash. Unless you’re incredibly short and thin, don’t expect this sweater to fit the same way it does on the model."
2.0,"No support and very low quality, I didnt expect much due to the low price point and bought them to lounge around in. Just did not fit correctly"
2.0,Love that my toddler says it’s comfy and fits good. The face just doesn’t look like Rob Gronkowski! Other then that…. a great shirt!
2.0,"The enamel part of the pin is pretty good quality.  That being said, the pin broke off in less than 2 months.  I can't recommend it."
2.0,"I wanted the sunglasses Meryl Streep wore in Postcards from the Edge.  These were the closest I could find and they're definitely not what I wanted.  They're so cheaply made and flimsy, I returned them. Don't waste your money."
2.0,Purchased these socks to go over swollen feet. They didn’t expand was in able to wear them.
2.0,Its a pretty ring but it looks fake... Its not real shiny or anything:.. And all the stones are crooked... Im not in love with it but you get what you pay for
2.0,Not a nice material almost like a thin spandex material and when stretched a little the colour fades out and is a bit see-through...  is not as i expected!
2.0,"This item is very pretty, however, caused major ear infections even after cleaning them prior to insertion. too big for septum and too big for tragus. I was a little sad about this purchase."
2.0,This is just meh. Not super flattering cut wise.
2.0,"This is very flimsy and impossible to get to fit on your ear properly, I spent a lot of time bending it around to no avail."
2.0,Very cute swimsuit beautiful material but fitted very large for a size 6.
2.0,Covers well doesn't stick good
2.0,I like the top but its definitely to big for me I need to down a couple sizes in short but wear xl size which Is what I ordered and it's like a dress on me 😂
2.0,Not as advertised. Inside lining dimensions 2 inches smaller the the outside which prevents you from utilizing the full dimensions ofvthe bag
2.0,"Too  ""garish"" looks like cheap/fake gold. But so pretty online.<br /><br />sorry  :("
2.0,Material is very thin. Become saggy after first wear.
2.0,I go these to wear u see my scrubs. They are very large and are not compression at all! Do not waste your money!
2.0,"Great , aside from the lenses are so flat your eyelashes rub against them, which feels weird and leave smudges right in front of your eyes..."
2.0,"This isn't lined. It's a nice plaid shirt; but, the description is factually inaccurate- the shirt has no liner, no fleece at all."
2.0,This product appears light blue but is instead grey
2.0,One side is sewn looser than the other so when you put the mask on the nose and mouth is a little to the side and not perpendicular with your face. I know it's prob an easy fix but when you're buying something it should be perfect already
2.0,I can't put the stim in my nose because it's too thick.
2.0,The picture gives an impression that three rings are connected together. Unfortunately they three separated rings. That would make a huge difference. It was misleading. It should have a picture of three separated rings so buyer won't be misleaded.
2.0,"The dress is better in picture than in real, and for 27$ with taxes you can find better quality fabric and accurate finish  in a dress bought at stores like jc penney. The bottom of the dress close to the front rip is not correctly sewn and it is wavy. Washed before use, the dress sheds tons of very little pieces, probably part of the plastic coating of the paillettes. Hopefully I put it in a mesh bag, but I had to clean both washer and dryer and be careful while opening the mesh bag. The dress strech and follow your body shape, but the size run small compaired to a standard size. I bought an S size for a standard S size woman,  but I suggest to buy one more size than usual. It is very very short and adherent, please consider this about this especially if you are curvy and tall."
2.0,Doesn't fit the watch ...my goof
2.0,I thought I knew what I was getting as I have many Junk Food pieces. This top is way shorter than it looks in the picture. It’s strangely wide with narrow arms. I can’t imagine who this would be flattering on.
2.0,I find these handles seem to be highly priced at $5:50 a piece.  I would say 2 for $5:50 would be a good price.
2.0,"Fit was correct, material as advertised. The one leg zipper had separated so you couldn't unzip the leg. I got a seamstress to fix it. Left thigh area had snags in it. But for price I guess they are OK."
2.0,"Small size, one sided, not a sphere."
2.0,I return the product due to the fact that it was very see through when I looked at it online it didn't appear sheer.  I thought it was more solid.
2.0,"Like another poster, mine arrived in a ziplock, in a bubble wrap sleeved envelop with other items, and therefore was damaged. The brass is very thin and easily dented, so the packing is woefully inadequate. Fit on standard humbuckers was perfect. The finish is barely average. Better off to buy quality versions from brand names."
2.0,"If you are a child or very young girl, you will like these earrings.  However, I do not belive they were made for an adult.  The smallest size could even be used for a 1 toddler."
2.0,It runs a bit too small and it came with a mission button. I had to find a spare button to attach to it and ill probably be getting a large instead of my usual large
2.0,"These earrings are gorgeous, heavy weighted and no cheap feeling.... however one of the earrings has missing stones.... some were loose in the box and who knows where the others are located as a result of manufacturing and shipment processes! I wish they held together better because I really like them.... oh well.... return!"
2.0,"The earrings were beautiful. I say &#34;were&#34;, because the backs provided for the earrings were very cheap and would come off repeatedly. I ended up losing one of the earrings due to this."
2.0,Cute back but no support at all. rides up on the front
2.0,"Fits weird across the shoulders, reeked of cheap plastic. The length was nice but it was like wearing a plastic bag."
2.0,It works but I was sad it shrunk & faded the 1st time I washed it.
2.0,These were a super cute design. The shoes began peeling the grey paint two days into wearing. The black paint peeled about 1 week after wearing. These are not durable shoes for everyday wear but might be okay for church or once in while wear
2.0,They didn’t fit but I should have read the description.
2.0,Cute stud for your cartilage but I did not receive the back to the earring? Had to take one off of one of my others.
2.0,"This review pertains to the navy striped dress. Pros - nice A-line shape, looks cute, comfortable to wear. Cons - pet hair clings to this dress like crazy, it wrinkles easily, and the side zipper is cheaply constructed and sewn in. The zipper on my dress broke on my 4th attempt at wearing it. So, for $30 I got 3 wears out of it which is fine but just know this isn't a high-quality dress that is going to last a long time. Buy it for a fun occasion and don't get too attached to it."
2.0,"Its very pretty but after wearing it twice, I put it on, flipped my (long) hair through, and the chain broke :("
2.0,"These are soft and well-made, but a personal pet peeve reduces my rating: the waist is high in the front but low - like buttcrack low - in the back. Very weird and uncomfortable."
2.0,The first day they were completely covered in hair and anything else that could stick to them
2.0,misspelled word on the bigger than it was bigger that
2.0,My girlfriend liked the material but it was way to small
2.0,"When we first got this hoops, they look very sturdy. Perfect size por my 4 years old daughter... I thought it was 50$ well invested... But only lasted 4 months and one of the hoop broke... Really not a 50$ quality earrings... My daughter is not a rough girl. She a very gentle and princessy girl..."
2.0,Way to small.  I wear a large and this top was fitted for someone who would wear a small :-(
2.0,Must have curves to pull this off.  Runs large
2.0,The top of the dress is green while the bottom of the dress is blue as shown. The dress is a thicker material very very adorable. This design is just as shown very nice flow
2.0,"I ordered this dress in two colors, one arrived with a think material, this color arrived with a thin/cheap see thru material. The color was also unflattering in comparison to the picture."
2.0,"Love the feel but the length is so long, like 6 inches too long. Will take to be altered but not happy."
2.0,"Shorts look and fit well. However, after one wash, button has already fallen off to where I can no longer fasten shorts closed above the zipper. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Was too small for my husbands wrist but nice looking watch
2.0,The earrings are much smaller than I expected.  They are tiny.
2.0,Very small pocket
2.0,Fits way too small. Order up in size.
2.0,"In the description they say they are underwear and shorts. Kinda confusing, I thought I was buying padded cycling underwear. They are very thick, not underwear they are shorts only due to the thickness of the waist band as well as the thickness of the shorts themselves. I am very disappointed. But was in a pinch and needed a pair and they work.. if you want to use them as shorts."
2.0,Looks cute but was plastic. I figured they would of at least been cheap metal or something other then plastic.
2.0,"The material is cheap plastic, I used it for skiing it will fog really bad. dont waste your money on this look for something else"
2.0,Cute for what I paid for it. I would not purchase it again.  I thought that since it origionally had a 99.99 price it would be a better quality but it has the quality of something you would find in the price range of 12.00 - 18.00 before sale.
2.0,Too short and boxy shaped
2.0,cute but almost see through
2.0,"I loved the color of the pants, but had to give them away because they were too small. It really saddens me there wasn’t a size larger. These are now my best friends favorite pants that I now lust over."
2.0,This skirt runs extremely small. I usually wear medium and large. Or a size 10 or 12.<br />The XL in this skirt didn’t even come close to fitting and the XXL barely fit and was even a bit snug.<br />I wish the sizing was correct because it is a very cute skirt!
2.0,This hoody is attractive but I ordered a 4X which is barely a 1X.  Runs very small.
2.0,VERY CHEAP MATERIAL BUT GOT THE JOB DONE
2.0,Cheap peeling decal on a standard hat. Save your money and get a real stitched one from HK
2.0,Poorly made. Flimsy fabric.
2.0,Returned this dress due to size and did not reorder.
2.0,"Might have been ok, but for the packaging.  The package &#34;bows&#34; in the middle , so mine showed up with neither the &#34;T&#34; bar OR the instructions.  So now all I have is the biner part that will forever have a 0000 combination! Grr, arg."
2.0,The ruffles are so scratchy that I cannot wear it. I would not recommend this sleep cap. It also falls off during sleep.
2.0,You have to pull it over your head as there are no clasp or hooks which is problematic. I ordered a larger one then and same thing.
2.0,"runs extremely large, for the type of material used, it made it very the outfit heavy. otherwise its was ok."
2.0,I was so excited to get this in the mail. the color is great just what AI wanted. BUT it runs small. I wear a 1x so I ordered a 2x and it was still to small. So order up a size.
2.0,It’s ok sleeves are too tight
2.0,"This looks nothing like the photograph. It’s very cheap feeling, much longer and not a choker. The stars are larger and it’s just a regular cheap looking necklace. I’ll probably give it to my 12-year-old cousin because I can’t wear it."
2.0,"Well, it looks bigger in the picture.  Definitely not nicely made.  Very cheap, I guess you get what you pay for huh?"
2.0,it says one size fits all ?  I have a normal hand width but they are way to tight :(
2.0,"Love it, rich color, doesn't bleed, fits my big wrist great. The locking mechanism sucks though. It's a pain in the butt to put on and after about a week of wearing it the bolt falls out and the whole bracelet falls off. Will update the review if it changes! But at this rate I'm scared to wear it because i know it'll fall off somewhere and be lost."
2.0,"The website shows just a plain orange color, which is what I wanted. For me, the neon orange ruins the entire look. Returning."
2.0,Quality was poor. Unsure of re-purchasing.
2.0,Very small & thin
2.0,too tight  for children.
2.0,It took me three tries to get it to work right. I attached the buttons. When I changed the color to attach different buttons it didn’t work anymore.  Also when the product arrived clear and black fasteners were broke in some areas. So I did not receive the full amount. I don’t think I would advise  anyone to buy this product.
2.0,Cheap China mass produced.  Not handmade at all
2.0,"I thought I ordered a stainless steel look with a grey strip inset. However, the strip is jet black and changes the appeal for me a lot. I would have ordered a solid color if I’d known. So while the  quality looks really good and shipping was fast, I will not wear this band."
2.0,"This little hat took a month to arrive. It's lovely, but is missing hair clips as is described. Also, the bottom is sealed off, so I don't imagine the flat bottom would be comfortable on my head even if I glued hair clips to it. I'll be returning it."
2.0,Way too big not to be name brand. I learn my lesson.
2.0,"I wear a large normally, and I ordered an extra large barely fit over my breasts! Almost like it wAs a size small."
2.0,Dont pull to hard it will break.
2.0,Cheap quality... like printed fabric. I thought these would fit an adult.  Barely fit my 4 yr old. Just FYI.
2.0,"The backpack design was nice, but the material wasn’t good, cheap material"
2.0,"Light weight, does not wick moisture away from face."
2.0,"Decent necklace, but they keep your e-mail address on file and send you messages suggesting other random pieces of jewelry."
2.0,"These are the kind of sunglasses where the lenses are just super tinted to make everything darker. They scratch easy if you’re not careful and you can barely see out of them, but I wasn’t going for quality here. I just wanted a bunch because I lose/break mine all the time."
2.0,Didn't work so well with my CPAP mask.
2.0,the size ran so tiny.
2.0,The shoes arrived with several scratches on them and looked poorly made.
2.0,Ordered a size up and it is still too small. Cute shirt but I had to give it to my little sister.
2.0,"They are adequate but not the best quality. 2 of them broke at the clasp when I attempted to put a light weight pendant on them. The cord itself is nice though, soft."
2.0,"I really love this sweater, but it did not arrive as advertised. The sleeves do not come attached and they didn't come with any lacing or ribbon to attach them to the sweater. So although I love it very much, I now have to go out of my way and spend more on a ribbon of some sort in order to wear the sweater I bought as it is shown pictured."
2.0,Están bonitos pero no fueron tanto de mi agrado
2.0,"It's stamped 925 Sterling, but it looks really cheap and the black part is chipped in places and looks more gray than black."
2.0,I got this before leaving on vacation and disappointed that the middle stone is slightly to the left and not in the center. Not good for my ocd lol
2.0,"The back stands out. It doesn't lay flat on your back. The front looks nice, but I won't wear this without a cardigan because the back looks poorly made."
2.0,Runs really small! Doesn't stretch to fit due to cheap material.
2.0,"Bigger than I expected, and smells rusty."
2.0,I bought this from the company and I don't like it at all. It is simply an over-sized too-wide flat straight fleece scarf which means it doesn't curve around the neck nicely so is not all that comfortable nor does it stay where you want it. I will use it for my granddaughter under her snowsuit instead this winter.<br /><br />Update 10/6/15: Was determined to make this work so I cut open the bottom of the pockets so I could slip my hands through and now it doesn't slide off and my arms stay covered! I added one more star.
2.0,Ran small. Gave to my daughter
2.0,"I sent this back, as the bust was too small and the bottom half was too big...strange fit.  Beautiful colors and fabric, though."
2.0,"The fit of this dress was very flattering, but the print was not what was pictured. It resembled a tablecloth and was very old fashioned looking. It also wasn’t as bright blue as pictured."
2.0,"I couldn’t get it too work, am returning it. Followed the instructions but couldn’t get it to lock."
2.0,Tightening strap was incredibly loose. Not able to actually tighten it at all.
2.0,Too small - order up
2.0,In the processof returning. Too small
2.0,You get what you pay for on this one....looks cheap
2.0,"The socks ran really small, not what I expected"
2.0,the colors are nice but the material is very scratchy.
2.0,Shoes were too small.  Sizing is way off.
2.0,"Nice shirt but Gildan is not the best, material too thick and sleeves always point out instead of hugging the arm. Would of preferred a lighter cotton or cotton blend."
2.0,Too small for my daughter. I couldn’t return because the window had closed . I wish I let her tried it when I received it .
2.0,"These fall right off my feet everytime, had to throw them all away and went to Journeys shoe store to buy some decent ones"
2.0,The earrings are so cute and I wish they didn't make my ears infected :(
2.0,"This was lighter weight than I expected. Not a big deal, but the hem is very cheaply sewn - it doesn't line up at the side seam and it started to unravel  on first wearing. It wasn't worth sending back so I fixed it myself by hand.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,I use it when I go fishing. It is warm enough for the bottom 4 heat pads but the top one you can't even feel it. It feels as if it is broken but it is still warm if I press my hand on it if I take it off. I already wore it a couple of times so I decided to keep it but if not.. I probably would have returned it.
2.0,"This is my third pair of Anne Klein shoes. Normally the fit has been perfect, but not this one. The fabric is too loose, it doesn’t have much support for the foot. It slides off my heel when walking."
2.0,I wear a size 9 and these are very small won’t stay on my foot slips right off very unhappy with these
2.0,Cute dress but VERY small - the medium fit more like a preteen size.
2.0,Waisted my money. Lost both within a month of receiving!
2.0,"Cheaply made. Thinner than it looks and the cuffs are cheap looking. When I shook it out, fuzz flew off of it. Also, it was baggy, but the snaps still popped open when I moved. Returned."
2.0,They’re cute but didn't keep my daughters hands warm
2.0,"This is a weird ""jacket.""  The collar fits strangely.  I don't like it and will not be wearing this.  It is very thin, almost a little too thin.  I don't really get it.  Just a very odd style, in my opinion."
2.0,** the light camouflage color isn’t squat proof **<br />(i don’t know about the other colors.)
2.0,"I ended up returning the item as soon as I opened the package. The items were ill fitting, larger than needed, and the print was poor. The heart design was illegible and the whole thing looked oversized and baggy."
2.0,Cheap material. For show not warmth or comfort. Print not the clearest either
2.0,I just received this shirt today and the tag has been cut off. So maybe the shirt has been used?
2.0,Fabric was too sheer & cheap.  Not true to size.
2.0,"I wanted the sleek look of not having the buckle, but like the other reviewers say it just comes off your wrist all the time. The buckle mechanism and the clip onto the watch. I thought it was the same as the Apple watch bands, but its actually reversed, where the Apple watch bands keep themselves attached  while you wear it because the end is under the band, on these the loose end is on the outside to be easily caught and pulled off, and with the loose attachment, it doesn't end well."
2.0,Too thin  to wear in public
2.0,"It's super cute, not the best quality and it just fits me weird"
2.0,"Too sheer, would need to wear with a slip.<br /><br />If you plan to wear this higher on the small of your waist I recommend sizing down. Mine was baggy and rode lower than I wanted on hips."
2.0,I dont like that the flare on the sleeve shows the back of the fabric which is white. The fabric should have been doubled so the flare would still show the pattern.
2.0,"The fit is boxy, too big on the body but the neckline is too tight. It is not a comfortable fit for running. I discovered this on my first run wearing it, too late to return."
2.0,"While this sweater seemed to be great quality for the money, was super soft and well fitting. Today was my first time ever wearing it and I put my hand in one of the pockets and the seem unraveled 😭 I can obviously stitch it up easily, but this being brand new I shouldn't have to."
2.0,"It's not an off the shoulder dress.The quality is decent for the price, and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but it's not as pictured at all."
2.0,"Dress is pretty, I thought maybe it had a built in slip but not. It will need a whole ate half slip if you purchased the yellow dress. Over all its a cute dress but not for me"
2.0,Top part fits perfectly but the leg part is way too short
2.0,"I had to pay return, it didn't fit."
2.0,"Just a sweat shirt, I returned it"
2.0,"The dress was really very lovely.  It was a great red color and had a pocket to boot!  I purchased my usual size, thinking the dress would skim my silhouette correctly.  However, the waistline did not sit at the waist and was more an empire-waist that made me look pregnant which was NOT flattering.  It could be the cut of the dress which does not work for my body shape."
2.0,"Didn't work on my glasses at all, so I discarded them."
2.0,"For a men’s Med it’s a little smaller than expected, I bought it for myself and I’m a female thinking it would be a perfect fit. Might need to return it for a large. Has a hole in one of the pockets"
2.0,"I got the yellow one as a gift for a friend. The product clearly shows it emblazoned with the word ""PASSPORT"" on the front. What I got though, was the same embossed logo on the inside, on the front bottom corner- ""Travelambo"". I got leather stickers to put on this cover so I could personalize it for my friend, but now this ugly logo is in the way and ruins my plans. I'm not even taking it out to take a picture because I want to send it right back. It's a shame this company is incapable of sending exactly what they show on the product page, because this item is a great color and seems like good quality."
2.0,to tide.
2.0,"Very thin, see-thru fabric, even though a dark print (primary color black)...heavy leotards weren't sufficient... required a ""slip"".....which made the outfit hot (102 outside- Texas Heat Wave!!).<br />Love the print itself....but the quality is lousy, including the manufacturing of the waistband."
2.0,I am 5' 5&#34; 146 lbs.  My chest is 38D.  This cover up i can wear as a fitted tank top.
2.0,I have to adjust it all the time to work. its cute n my daughter loves it but what a hassle!!!
2.0,"The sizing on this sweater was wacky. The chest was larger than I expected and the sleeves were at least 6” longer than my arms but were too tight to be comfortable. The deal breaker for me though was that the collar was nearly too small for me to get my head through and then felt like it was choking me once I managed to get the sweater on. Despite what my wife may say from time to time, I do not have an unusually large head.<br />I would totally believe this was a hand knit sweater: it was proportioned just like the ridiculously ill-fitting hand knit sweaters blind grannies make in comedy skits.<br />It may be the one I received was just “off.” The seller was great about accepting returns and I may try to order one again in the future because I liked the look and feel of it (aside from the fit). It might be worth giving this a shot by ordering it for yourself but Is be cautious about sending it as a gift unless the recipient won’t be shy about asking to return it if it is weird."
2.0,"The instructions are impossible to read, it took 2 days to figure it out."
2.0,quality seemed good. but size way off. ordererd size 34 waist.  could not come even close to buttoning. probably at least 3 maybe 4 inches off.  more like they were 30 inch waist.
2.0,i like the design but you get what you pay for! the sleeves do not match and the seam is horrible! but you can wear something on top and wear it inside your pants so its wearable
2.0,"I bought this because it's super cheap. Well, it looks pretty cheap too. I'll wear it when I go to karaoke but other than that, it's not going to see the light of day much."
2.0,Beautiful handbag perfect side but extremely disappointed the smell will not go away even after doing everything suggest on the card they send with the purse. Will not by another purse from the maker due to this.
2.0,They are an OK pair of sunglasses but BIG and TALL would not be the words i use to describe them.  They are just another average size pair of sun glasses that don't fit my guy.
2.0,First time I ordered it had to return it the same day. I got a medium and it was too big. I ordered a small one and still big but I kept it. I have wore it a couple of times and the material looks awful. It doesn't have a clean look. One of the inside pockets has a whole in it.
2.0,"I've worn it for a month without taking it out. Somehow the paint on the hoop chipped, so I can't wear it anymore without it irritating my piercing site."
2.0,It's a nice blue heart necklace but the chain it's so weakness but it looks great and charm on the neck
2.0,This fit too small even though I followed the size guide and ordered a size bigger then what I thought I needed.
2.0,So I bought these they are super cute and look just like the image however they are way Smaller then what i have. I’m a 0g and seems like I got something smaller then that which was a disappointment.
2.0,Waterproof is definitely a stretch.  I went for a walk in a drizzle (not a downpour) and ended up with several spots where the rain had soaked through.  It was a 45 minute walk.  I would say this is more of a &#34;water-resistant&#34; product.
2.0,When you take them out of the package which by the way was packaged nicely you expect to get clean items. This was not the case. Both had dirty spots on them!
2.0,Very thin. Skull does not line up at top.
2.0,The legs are too skinny to get on.
2.0,"Not flattering, material not for me,purchased a size up from my normal size and was tight ."
2.0,With in a week it started to fall a part
2.0,I love the shorts but the cut of the shirt is really weird. It’s very short and wide. Even with the adjustable straps loosened all the way it shows no cleavage and it gets skinnier at the top so I get weird side boobage. I have larger breasts so it ends up looking like a boxy mumu.
2.0,This was so cute when I ordered then the band started falling apart only after wearing for a few weeks. Kind of a waste of money considering it didn’t even hold up that long.
2.0,"The first time my daughter used these, she lost one twice. First time found it. Second time without luck. Otherwise real pretty"
2.0,Wrong colors on T-shirts. Returned via Kohl’s for credit card credit.
2.0,Bad. Just don't get it. Wayyyy too small.
2.0,Kind of cheaply made and fragile
2.0,Really don’t care of how it’s made gave away as a gift. I work outdoors with my hands wouldn’t last long .
2.0,Substandard construction to say the least. I was surprised to see an exposed zigzag (but) frayed hem too.
2.0,"They slip off the earring post to easy, Not the right kind of rubber for post earrings.<br />Bought these for stud Diamond earrings. Will not take the chance."
2.0,"I love the style of this hat and I love that it comes with adjustable padding.  I don't love that the front of the hat tore open after wearing it for less than a month.  I'm a country music singer and my hats do endure a lot of wear and tear, yet usually I get about 6 months out of anything with quality.<br /><br />I might try buying this hat again just to see if the one I got was a fluke (the company would not send me one because I was a few days over the 30 day mark when I got around to writing them).  But until then I can't recommend this hat unless you will wear it GENTLY and only once in a while, then it will probably work out for ya!  Hope this help someone!"
2.0,Very cheaply made; the pleat colors were pale and did not lay as shown.  I never wore this dress and sent it straight to the goodwill.
2.0,"I thought the style would work for me and was looking for a below the knee dress.. sometimes this works (buying a long dress for short people), not this one .. the elastic waistband is for someone with a super short torso .. so it makes you look pregnant if you are tall. The “tail” of the dress hits in a bad spot at the back of the knees. Stay away long torso and long legged women. Unless you are built like a long stemmed mushroom 🍄."
2.0,"This was disappointing as far as the material very cheap and it smelled horrible like chemicals and plastic, I wouldn’t recommend this product, cute material and because I go on vacation tomorrow I am keeping it but if I had more time I wouldn’t keep this product."
2.0,Inaccurate sizing and colors that fade away within 3 washes make this not worth buying.
2.0,"The velcro was way too strong.  The material a little too thin.  I wanted something softer, thicker.  I sent it back."
2.0,"The only reason I give a bad review is because the size it was too small something is wrong with your  size chart. I usually wear small size, I measured my body to find my size and it didn’t fit me it was probably two sizes smaller. I liked it but I didn’t want to order a bigger size I was afraid it would be too big."
2.0,box itself Is nice but the only thing that we don't like is the strap. Its made cheaply. It won't stay where you adjust it when carrying your lunch in it.
2.0,"Looked and felt cheap. I couldn't tell if it made me look more like an umpire or a convict. It was not flattering in style or form, although it fit just fine.<br /><br />Material felt cheap, the kind you know will smell awful the second sweat hits it."
2.0,not as pictured-  was not in box it only had a piece of foam
2.0,The fabric of this dress is dreadful
2.0,When I received the shirt I was excited super cute! Material is awesome but it has a hole :( below the K. Any word on sending me a good one? I would appreciate it
2.0,"Smaller than expected and the white fabric sheds horribly... Still wore it, but not as happy with the product."
2.0,Bag was wrapped in tissue which had to be picked off with tweezers. It took 45 minutes.
2.0,"It's like a kid ring with plastic heart inside.  It's something totally different  that pic have shown. I bought that before at other e shop ,they got the ring just exactly same as shine as the pic."
2.0,I like the designs..but very flimsy!
2.0,"cute, lined wish it fit.  I could barely put it on the top of my head.  no way it would go halfway to the ears.  Even my daughter with a relatively small head couldn't wear it.  It is child sized"
2.0,It arrived late so I wasn't able to use it.  The champagne colored tie has sparkly weave in it.  It's not the most attractive look.
2.0,Shoes smell awful! I am not sure if it is the rubber or glue. Smells toxic and I would be afraid for a child to wear it.
2.0,Huge gap in between the top 2 buttons so they’ve added a very awkward snap button that still doesn’t eliminate a gap. Nice material & true to color but overall not worth it for me.
2.0,"Ran very small, material is thin."
2.0,"These kept slipping off.  Considering the whole purpose of these is to keep your glasses on your face, I'd consider this a less than optimal product."
2.0,Perfect size but the material of the heel is plastic it ripped of in tow weeks. I would recommned paying more for a she with a better material.
2.0,"This pair of earrings were cute to look at, and unusual in design, however the first time I wore it(today), I lost one.<br />If you have long hair, the chain portion gets tangled up in your hair. The chain is so fine, it slips right of the ear, and there is no backing of any kind to secure it.<br />After spending 85.00 I only got the chance to wear it once, as I lost one with the first wear."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:d1da0844c9cc1c0bfbede298a07a5d8a]] Here are the pros and cons of this ring:<br />Pros- The ring is pretty, and the band is sturdy. I really love the shine from the opal stone, and the stones around it shine brightly in the light. The design is beautiful! This is a good temporary ring (and I mean, very short-term) if you really love opal stones.<br /><br />Cons- After wearing it for a few times, here's what the ring needs for improvement. I wish the edges of the band were smoother and not so boxy... it leaves a bit of uncomfortable space between my fingers, but it’s minimal. The band also feels scratchy around my surrounding fingers and it snags hair. Also amongst the inside of the ring, the middle part (where the stone is positioned) may scratch your finger when you're putting it on and off because, as I have said before, it is not a smooth texture. I did not notice this until I have worn other rings."
2.0,"This isn't what I expected by the pictures. It doesn't hang straight down, it is fitted at the waist. It also runs small. I'm strongly considering returning the sweater. I'm disappointed.  I loved how it looked in the pictures."
2.0,5'1 105 lbs<br />Bought xs<br />Tho i am usually xxs xs should not be as loose as this<br />Color is somehow similar but darker in person than the website photos<br />Maybe i should have just bought a black or long sleeves as the wider short sleeves seems kinda funny<br />Very nice fabric and the thickness is just right<br />The sleeves were too much wider than expected<br />The length is fine it's an inch above the knee<br />The flare design is also very nice specially for summer<br />The only this that really disappoints me is the stiches<br />I looked into the photos and reviews their stiches was less to none overlap stiches but mine has extended stiches all pver he design
2.0,"I'll start out by saying I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because they're cute and comfortable for my 2.5 year old to wear at preschool.<br />BUT - he has literally been wearing them for ONE WEEK and already the toes on both of them have ripped at the seam. So, now I have to spend MORE money because these ones lasted literally ONE WEEK."
2.0,Cheap and flimsy- doesn’t look as good as the picture. Typical cheap Chinese crap I fortunately.
2.0,"Packaged well, fits well and looks great. Also very comfortable.  However, after wearing it for the second time the heal bent forward and now they are not wearable and need repair. Disappointed."
2.0,The chest and arms were too small...couldn't even move my arms to zip.
2.0,"These were very, uh, forward.  I put on a tighter pair of cotton shorts over them, and my wife said &#34;please don't leave the house in that&#34;.<br /><br />Maybe I got the size wrong.  Maybe they're designed for a, ah, peacock effect.  Not quite my trunks, though."
2.0,The headband was fine the mask was too small
2.0,Fits true to size.  Came scratched and looked used.  Doesn't look like it will last long either. Poor quality materials used.
2.0,"These are soft, but if you have a butt prepare to have a major camel toe. I tried them on before my workout and immediately changed into something else to save myself the embarrassment. They’re completely seamless so there is no defined front or back."
2.0,The quality is not what I expected from the nice picture. The size runs a little big and shoe lace is not a good idea for toddlers.
2.0,"Cute and dainty, just the way I like my earrings, but these keeps popping out I've lost them 3x already thankfully found them. They aren't locking for some reason, and no I didn't wear them to bed."
2.0,Its very light .
2.0,These are much smaller then I had thought they would be.
2.0,Aparentan ser buena calidad pero no lo son.
2.0,Good only for a one time use for pictures. Snaps broke first day and it was an awkward fit.
2.0,Picture was better.  Maybe ok for young person.
2.0,Watched it seperately in cold water the first time and the red bled all over the white.
2.0,Love the design but it's poorly made. This was a Christmas gift for my best friend and it broke the 2nd day she wore it.
2.0,Robe was too thin and the sleeves were too short on my daughter. Will be returning.
2.0,"I mostly got this dress for the color,I just loooooove that shade of yellow. I had a really hard time putting it on then realized theres an awkward placed zipper on the side. Putting it up took a lot of effort. That zipper really messes up the dress for those of us that are busty. Wish it was stretchy and didnt have the side zipper."
2.0,Poor quality. There are fishing line type in the ruffles and came out when my daughter tried it on.
2.0,The shape of this suit is more like a square.... definitely made for a stocky body.  An average shape would not fit into this.
2.0,"At first, I was obsessed with my new nose ring! The bone style is easy to put in, the gem was tiny (which I wanted), and it sparkled like a real gem. But I've had it for 3 weeks (one of which I wasn't even wearing this ring) and the gem already snapped off of the post! I'll grant you: I wasn't expecting God's gift to nose rings here; I paid $12 for it. But I definitely was hoping for much more than 2 weeks wear out of it! Pretty disappointed."
2.0,Hurts inside my boots. Too short. Buy longer ones
2.0,Very thin material. I bought for work but it is too thin. Disappointed.
2.0,"I ordered a size 7 and they sent size 39 which is like an 8.5 . Too much trouble to return. The heel is lower than arch and front, does not work for me even if it was the right size, throws off my center of gravity, my hip drops and causes leg pain. May work for some if this is the angle you need."
2.0,Could be more durable
2.0,"Very cute, fit perfect. But I have now worn two of them and both had the underwire pop out within hours of wearing. The do not look cheap, but proving to be very poorly made."
2.0,This hat did not fit well at all. It was tight around the bottom and too tall.
2.0,"Too big and baggy, was rather unflattering for my shape so I returned it."
2.0,On the model this looks pretty and bohemian but it just made me look like a saloon girl.  The fabric is also very thin and sheer.
2.0,"I really liked the dress in the pictures for a simple cute summer dress . The one I received is somewhat accurate but the colors aren't as vibrant ( can barely see the pink on the dress .)<br /><br />I am on the short size (5'2) but the dress came down to my shins . I did try with a belt , pulling it up and over the belt some but it made me big without shape .<br /><br />Dress has a slip built in and isn't very see through , if you wear white or nude underneath you'll be fine . But the slip material is kinda weird and a little scratchy .<br />I did return ."
2.0,Style wise these were very cute. But the mirror finish creates a glare in the sun. Also 2 weeks later they completely broke. Felt comfortable to the face but not a well built pair of sunglasses if you ask me
2.0,"One size , didn’t fit my head ."
2.0,Waaay too small. I got the largest size offered and there's no was it would fit me because of my 34 DD breasts.
2.0,About 1 month after purchase my daughters Velcro came completely unsewn from the shoe and I had to glue it back. About a week later my other daughter had her bow come completely apart on one shoe.
2.0,Way to big .
2.0,Fabric too heavy
2.0,"The bra is brilliantly comfortable, but who in their right mind decided that a white bra needed brown trim on the outside? AND that the photos for the product would hide this???<br /><br />I returned this, as the photos showed a solid white bra with dark trim on the inside only."
2.0,"They use what seems like a paper clip and it really irritates my lobes but they see very cool, just cheap."
2.0,"I loved the thin, cool material, but the cups didn't stay in place well and I found myself needing to adjust them several times a day."
2.0,Used once and the entire side ripped open... You get what you paid for
2.0,It comes open and my watch just falls to the ground randomly. Thankfully it’s in a case or it would be broke already.
2.0,"Firstly, this is a pretty jumpsuit.  It pulls up from the floor and once you have it situated on your body, it ties on top of each shoulder.  The olive green is beautiful and the quality is fairly decent.  I had a huge problem with the sizing though.  It's cut so small!  I was able to get it on but it showed every lump and bump, which a style like this should help to camouflage.  If you order it, I highly recommend you order at least one size larger than you usually wear.  Especially if you want it a bit baggy.  I think this product is overpriced for what you actually get.  I would return it for a size up but it only goes to X-large, which I feel equals up to a US 12/14."
2.0,Mostly as described but for not true to size. A bit small. Fabric is of ok quality. It is warm as a layering sort over other clothes. The color was as described. I just expected a better more flattering fit & more comfort.<br />Ok not awesome for the price.
2.0,Bought fir my grandson. Really cute but not comfortable.
2.0,"These fit great and were comfortable, but I am returning them due to the vertical seam right in the middle. It leaves little to the imagination!"
2.0,"I am pretty sure there is actually leather in it, but it seems that the external layer is made of PU (i.e. plastic) which gives a cheap touch and a not so shiny look, in comparaison to full leather belts."
2.0,"The blouse had no shape to it, especially not the shape that was shown in the picture"
2.0,"I ordered a size up for my mom, she normally wears a size 6/8 and it was still too small!  Very disappointed!!!"
2.0,"Size was to be expected; however, the quality of the material was like tight...not leggings.  When I purchased the full length packet in the Fall, they were much sturdier and thicker (more like stretch pants material, not tights)."
2.0,"Looks just like the pix, fabric is good, stitching is good, but I can't fit into it the shoulders and arm holes are too small"
2.0,"I purchased 2 of these in early 2020 and they were fantastic. Needed to rebuy once the wires started coming out. Ordered the same size, 36DDD, and the bras that come in were more like a 36C."
2.0,Hearts falloff too easy.
2.0,"THESE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE; HOWEVER, THE CUT IS VERY WRONG. I HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE AND THE MAIN ISSUE THAT I HAVE IS HOW HIGH THE CUT IS AT THE BACK OF THE NECK AND BACK SHOULDERS. I HAVE MANY RACERBACK  TOPS OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM THAT I CAN WEAR WITH THIS BRA THAT IT DOES NOT REVEAL THE BRA IN THESE 2 AREAS.  THE PICTURE SHOWS 2 SIMILAR BRAS I GOT FROM AMAZON AND HOW HIGH THE CUT IS ON THE BOLLYQUEENA. THE WHOLE POINT OF WEARING A RACERBACK BRA IS NOT HAVING YOUR BRA REVEALED.  THESE ARE ONLY GREAT IF YOU ARE WEARING A MOCK TURTLENECK."
2.0,Medium seems to run small and feel tight around the elastic.  Order a bigger size.  I'm not a huge fan of mine but they will do in a pinch.  I especially don't like to wear these to bed since these are a little snug.
2.0,Do not go by the chart measurements. Not even close. It is cute and my granddaughter will like it.
2.0,Even though I'm only 5'2&#34; the waist was still above the natural waist line. Fabric looks nice but felt only ok. Color is pretty spot on to the photo.
2.0,"(These show as currently unavailable, so I am not sure what the retail asking price is)<br /><br />As far as just regular, non-heated gloves, these are ok.  They have a cinch around the wrist to keep snow out, which is nice, and they have textured thumb and palm areas for easier gripping.  The size is maybe a little tight. I have large hands and these are large gloves but they juuuust fit.  The small clip to attach the gloves together for storage is a loop and hook; a bit annoying to undo to separate the gloves.  A small buckle works better on all of the other gloves I own.  Three-star, run-of-the-mill gloves with a slight bargain feel to them.<br /><br />The big downside is actually the heating system.  The gloves have a large, bulky battery pack on the back of  the wrist area to power the heating system.  The pack has an on/off switch, no auto-off, so you have to unzip and switch off when you are done, BEYOND pushing a button on the back of the glove for 3 seconds to turn off the heating feature.  They also didn't come with any instructions, so the red/white/blue solid and flashing patterns had me wondering what it was doing.  For reference, there are instructions here in the Amazon description.  The battery pack is so bulky, I wouldn't be surprised if injury could occur from the pack jamming into the back of the wrist during a fall while skiing,etc.  They are advertised as motorcycle gloves, so that collision factor may not have come into the design process, but again, it seem shortsighted that they cannot be recommended for use in snowplay.  The gloves did warm up, but only a bit, even on the high section.  Felt more like I was standing in the sunshine while wearing them, but the heat may be a greater relief while riding a motorbike.<br /><br />The cumbersome battery pack is really the deal-breaker here.  They aren't bad gloves overall at a budget price, but come with too many strings attached."
2.0,"THE PRODUCT HAS POOR WAIST HOLD, AND WAIST ELASTIC.<br /><br />IT HAS OFTEN CAUSED WARDROBE  MAL-FUNCTION.<br /><br />THE QUALITY OF WAIST HOLD HAS TO BE IMPROVED<br /><br />DR.ARVIND C KACKER"
2.0,Product did not hold up.
2.0,Poor craftsmanship. It cut in the underarm area as if it wasn't design properly or proportionately.
2.0,They're super cute but I made the mistake of showering with one on and it already lost the gold color. The other ones started fading after wearing them twice
2.0,"The cardigan I received is not what is shown or what I expected. Not sure what part of this is &#34;longline&#34; as I'm 5'2&#34; and it didn't even cover my behind. The fabric is t-shirt quality cotton blend, which is nice. However the sizing is very small. I can usually get by with a 1X and I bought the biggest size they had  (2X) and it is wayyyy too small - barely a large. Not what I expected at all."
2.0,The front is cute to deep around the breast exposing much of your side boops...it was cheap but cant even wear the dress
2.0,"Beautiful pattern but very cheaply made.  The dress is not lined and the tie in the back is too short.  The zipper stuck and I was afraid of ripping it when I tried it on.  I did pair it with a petticoat underneath to give it some flare.  If it weren’t so cheaply made, I’d keep it"
2.0,It was CRAZY Big and it looked a little cheap... even though it is not
2.0,"The green was beautiful but the trim was more peach than nude. The longer end of the hem comes to a very sharp point, something you can't really see in the pictures. The fabric is soft and satiny, but it seems like it wasn't cut on the bias because it just doesn't drape as nicely as you'd expect. I'm 4'11"", 119 pounds and the small was too big across the chest so the trim didn't sit for against my body but puckered. I returned."
2.0,I was very disappointed in this product. We bought it for a Mardi Gras party but couldn’t use it because the hat was really small and actually should have been for a child. We returned it.
2.0,Definitely cheap sunglasses. But they still block the sun and look pretty cute
2.0,"Cute colors and style, but way too SHEER and the top was cut smaller than the photo so it barely covered a strapless bra (that you could see perfectly through the sheer material). Liked the dress, but for nearly $25 I could find a better fitting, less sheer dress to wear this summer. RETURNED!"
2.0,Too big. Fits a man’s wrist or very large wrists. Had to return it
2.0,these are not unisex... was super disappointed. definitely made for a mans foot
2.0,It was fine until I washed it and shrank so much it was unwearable.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:e98c3a18304e099a3473e362a7cb9735]] Overall really like the design and materials, think maybe I just got a bad pair. Interestingly the rattling goes away when the frames stretch a little as you put them on… would like to see the logo etched/imprinted, but for the price point- these aren’t bad!"
2.0,I love these shorts but they run smaller then usual size. Very tight on stomach cuts off circulation
2.0,It's a cheap jacket so you get what you pay for. The amount of feathers spilling out far exceeded my low expectations as did the number of loose threads. That said I don't know if it would be better or worse from uniqlo or another seller. Sleeves are way too short even on the mega size that I ordered.
2.0,"5X is just barely a size 10, and it's just a wider and no highth. before washing in cold water,  item shrunk even more.  Fabric is cheap and flimsy. Doesn't hold its shape."
2.0,Not a fan. Fits very small!
2.0,This was the replacement suit that I received after the first one was way too big for the size ordered. This one the bottoms again were WAY TOO BIG and the leg openings were missing elastic. Just as the first one ordered. I’m keeping it and plan on fixing it myself  but don’t order it if you can’t sew.
2.0,Love the look and fit of this dress. I ordered the cream in a large and it’s very see through and the material is thin. I am returning it but I may get it in black.
2.0,Did not work for me. They don’t fit all the way around so not able to get a snug hold.
2.0,"This material is not what is advertised or pictured. It says and looks like a soft cotton blend in the pictures but it is actually a more stiff synthetic material and not soft at all. It is big as expected, but the back area is strangely shaped due to the fabric being so stiff. I am slender and 5,6', and it fits, even hits my ankles. But again, the back looks very weird. Front is ok, but again the material is so bad that it lays weird. it almost folds on my butt area because it is stiff material. The advertisers are not posting correct information!"
2.0,Weird pattern on back sides.
2.0,"I have always have good experience with Casio until now. If I had known about the light problem before, I wouldn't have made the purchase. I like to know what time it is in the dark, but this watch is a loser."
2.0,"Did not fit me, despite supposedly being made to fit 28-whatever inches, I have a 30 inch waist so it should have fit just fine. Returned."
2.0,Watch hands are almost invisible against background.  Watch itself mech. nice design.
2.0,"For the price, this bag was fine for carrying my wallet and phone into a college football game. However, as other reviewers have said, the straps are a completely different color than the actual bag. I like the crimson color on the bag (as advertised) but the bright right straps are awful. I wound up using the wristlet strap so that the contrast was a little less obvious."
2.0,Not very good quality and doesn’t stay on good!
2.0,The size was small ordered another pair and then the same style was out of stock
2.0,I tend to be sensitive to different metals but didn't have a problem with this product. It is also easy to put in.<br /><br />The not so good parts of this purchase: each nose stud comes out rather easily and the tiny 'gem' on the at least 50% of the nose studs was off center and unbearable.
2.0,"I gotta say, I don't believe this is real leather. It's tough, stiff, and plastic feeling. The color is also much different from how it appears on the posting. I was expecting more of a light mint blue, and this is a darker, kinda dingy green. Still cute but didn't meet my expectations, especially for the price"
2.0,The color was darker than shown
2.0,The package arrived on time... but the issue is that one of them is missing half of its mouth and is also bent... this was my gift for my wife for Christmas.. have to go do shopping again because of this
2.0,It looks A-line in pictures but is actually more of a mermaid cut. Fit too tight through the tummy and butt. Great value and quality for the $
2.0,Incredibly small and almost child size in a women’s medium. Sent back.
2.0,Disappointed..... Bag came ripped.
2.0,Really great but the clasp broke in less than 1 month
2.0,The buttons &#34;PULL&#34; at the side of the garment making it hang strangely!!
2.0,One of the backs are broken and<br />3 stars fell off and this was before I even took them out of package.<br />The ribbon does not keep shape
2.0,"This is cute, however it won't stay on the ear well.  The tail part will but the actual place to put it into the ear, doesn't fit and the back of the earring falls off easily."
2.0,"I loved the idea of this dress. But when I actually tried it on, it was not flattering. I normally wear a size L/12 and am 5'10"" for reference, and this was way too short in the waist for me. Fit me more like an empire waist, so I returned this one"
2.0,"Fabric is as expected, nice and smooth and feels cool (temp).<br />Dislike: too small, tight, not much stretch; mesh size was supposed to be front? But it’s much lower than the other side, meaning much fabric would cover much of my hair."
2.0,Shrunk in a steam dryer 2 sizes
2.0,"I love the watch, I just wish I could have been able to wear it longer than a day."
2.0,The pendant itself arrived safely but the chain was broken inside its Packaging. I just took the pendant and put it on another necklace.
2.0,Either I was shipped the wrong size or the item was way too small. I ordered XXL so it would be extra big. It fits my average size 9 year-old!
2.0,I don't care for the material for a big girl.  It is &#34;unforgiving&#34;.
2.0,I love the patterns but when I put it on there is about 3 inches on the bottom that was not sewn properly and there is a gaping hole where my calf is.  Not high quality. Disappointing but I still wore it to church just safety pinned it because I can't sew!!! LOL
2.0,Of the ten items I received two had stripped threads and are unusable right away.<br /><br />It would be foolish to expect a compass on an item like this to be &#34;accurate&#34; and so I'm not surprised the four tend to simultaneously point in different directions from each other. Don't hinge arriving alive on these compasses!!<br /><br />Twenty percent product failure rate is pretty high. I wouldn't buy again or from the buyer. I'll update as I start working with the &#34;acceptable&#34; ones.
2.0,"This handbag was Ok, that is all I can honestly say about it.  Not as nice in person as it looks in the online picture.  Quite floppy, no body to it.  I will keep it for casual use, it was only 28.00 what can I expect.  Also, it came packaged in a bag covered with Chinese writing.  I always try to avoid products made in China, was disappointed with Amazon for allowing it to  be packaged like this. KInd of creepy....It has been my experience that most products that come from China are not made very well. We shall see."
2.0,"Very cute summer shirt, but not flattering for larger chests.  The screen print makes the shirt lay weird in the chest area."
2.0,Not happy with the shirt. The color is not what I expected but I do like it. The material is also not to my liking. There is no stretch at all. I will not be keeping this one.
2.0,"These are some interesting shorts. There’s an elastic waistband, they don’t zip up button up. The top of the shorts aren’t tight to your body it kind of fans out. They also looked really weird when pulled up high or low on me. I couldn’t find a way to wear them to make them look good. They’re are very loose too. These are not for me and I wouldn’t recommend them"
2.0,It was ok but the zipper ends kept poping off Amd It wore down too quickly
2.0,Would not fit I need a 29mm
2.0,"I have large hands with long fingers.  The XXL is bigger across the width, but the fingers are short.  The lining is not tacked to the outer covering, so when I pull my hands out the lining follows.  Every time I put the right one on I have to search with my thumb to find the inner thumb part.  Frustrating.  But once on they are warm."
2.0,The bag looked great except that the snap was not lined up correctly so the handles did not line up. I will have to return.
2.0,Material fine but size not to specs. Not spacious enough for accessories. Laptop didn’t fit.
2.0,This is way to big and it falls off my shoulders. Took forever to arrive
2.0,"The A was not in the center. There were some cracks and damage around the center, on both of them. Do not recommend."
2.0,Sizing is off and it feels cheap.  I've bought other mood rings off the internet for the same price that were much better.
2.0,Too small for 7 and 8 year olds
2.0,It's not African material 👎🏼
2.0,Liked the fit in chest.
2.0,"First what I liked about this shirt - the fabric is very nice, has some good stretch to it for a satin and it looks very well put together. It looks absolutely lovely ... until you put it on. I read the other reviews about sizing up as it runs small and so I did that. It fits just fine around but the length is ridiculous. You'd have to be well under 5 ft tall for this shirt to fit properly. The shirt ends close to my waist almost like a crop top. I really wanted to like this shirt as it was EXACTLY what I was looking for. But I can't get over the fit. No good. I have to return it."
2.0,I like the leather & lace
2.0,"It’s a cute pattern, but it’s smaller than I expected and therefore not as modest as I would have liked. I thought the shorts would also be a little longer than they are. I am returning this item because it didn’t meet my expectations."
2.0,It is too big.  Girls wearing this are between the ages of 6-18.  They give a good chain length for larger wrists but it does not fit my 8 year old daughter at its smallest chain.  It will now sit for a few years.
2.0,"The velcro seemed flimsy<br />The size was supposed to be  US 9 (which is EU 26) but said EU 28 inside.<br />These shoes were way too big, and also very very wide.<br />My child has narrowish feet.<br />I ended up sending them back."
2.0,When I received the item it had a couple holes in both sides of the jacket. Can be fixed but for $30 I should have to be fixing it. It was also very dirty looking. Otherwise it is a cute jacket.
2.0,Overall the jacket was very cute but sadly way too small so ended up giving it to a much smaller framed person.  I ordered an XL as I wear a 14 and it fit the size 6 person perfectly.
2.0,I ordered a size 6 petite and gotten  a large from my waist to ankle 😣
2.0,One of the seams had another part of the dress lining caught in it and the side zipper a great design but too small for the size of dress.
2.0,"I love the look of this. I have big hands so I usually cannot wear bangles unless I order a size. This one fit easily.<br />The cons- the gold color turned copper after a few days , it’s now has a cheap dollar store look to it. So I won’t wear it. I haven’t had it a month. I’m also not sure that it’s authentic quartz. It may be simulated quartz. I wanted something I could wear regularly for the benefits of the crystal. I am disappointed."
2.0,Large doesn't mean &#34;Large&#34;... it means small to medium in my world.
2.0,I always read reviews before I purchase as well as the size chart.  I like the material but it was wayyyy too small for me.  It’s a bummer because everything else I like.  I’m 5’3 and a size 12-14.  The xl was too small and I usually fit that or a large.
2.0,"I was somewhat excited to try this product since my glasses keep fogging up while i wear my mask. I was extremely disappointed! First try, second try, third try... still foggy glasses. Oh well!! I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but at last not a good purchase."
2.0,I would love this hoodie if it wasn’t too small. It’s so soft and comfy but way too small. I sized up to make sure it was a little loose and it’s still too small. Super bummed.
2.0,The watch is really nice looking but I ordered twice because I didn't get the bracelet the first time. The bracelet didn't come the second time either. It is a great watch though.
2.0,these were narrow and way small
2.0,Very small compared to other brands.
2.0,I returned this as the white part on the band was soiled.
2.0,Not satisfied with this purchase at all. I like that the cup fits but the adhesive is not good. I only tried it on once and the adhesive kept peeling off.  Now I'm worried i wont be able to wear them without having to rush to a rest room to adjust them.
2.0,"pics here very cute, fits nothing like picture and for sure order up a few sizes then normal"
2.0,I received it and it does not look anything like the picture.  It is more of a shorter shirt style than the way it shows on the picture
2.0,Says it’s a 4 pack but only received 3.<br /><br />Pros: adjustable enough to fit on a large ankle. Comfortable enough and not itchy.<br /><br />Cons: not a fan of how the string ends just hang out and aren’t tied to each other. If it gets pulled Or the outer knot gets loose then the other strings can just come right out.
2.0,Too large and show with loafers.  I returned them.
2.0,the shrinkage...I wear them now...they shrunk and my Husband cant  wear them.
2.0,Worried about ironing wrinkles out and scorching !
2.0,Returned them - painfully tight around my toes. Fabric was also beginning to run around the top band.
2.0,Ordered for my husband for a vegas trip. We ended up not using it because it smelled and it fell apart and we couldn't put it back together. Maybe good for a prop but not as a mask.
2.0,The earrings are beautiful but certainly not adult size.  They are child size (baby).
2.0,"As much as I wanted to love this dress, I can't. First off, the shoulders are super tight. I have no idea who thought it was a great idea to make the shoulder/chest area so congested, it's like cutting off your breathing. But fitting everywhere else looks great, even though it is a see through dress, I could've worked with it if there was enough shoulder width area. I hope they know not all girls are skinny and short, I used to lift so girls who wear large may not fit into it. I'm probably gonna return it unless I can convince my mom to take a look at it and fix it for me."
2.0,"Is big & that's fine, but is to heavy & that's without anything in the bag, I thought it was going to be different; is not bad, but is not what I expected."
2.0,The bracelet did not stay on.
2.0,"While this is a beautiful watch, IT DOESN'T WORK. I wound it exactly as instructed, and each time it only ticked for about 30 seconds before completely stopping. This is nothing but a decoration if it won't actually keep time."
2.0,Fit as expected. Material was very flimsy.
2.0,"I absolutely loved the look of these but within a couple days, they fell off without me knowing. They're incredibly hard to keep in so be warned you WILL need to keep a constant watch on these to make sure they stay!"
2.0,"Its plastic, and falls off constantly. It looks pretty but its cheaply made. I returned it."
2.0,"I ordered according to the size chart, which fits into the size I normally wear, and I can't even get it over my shoulders.  The fabric isn't the best either."
2.0,I purchased two of the same dress.  I didn't<br />decide to wear the first one until after 30 days and realized the pocket was not stitched correctly so  I couldn't wear it.  I ordered a second  one and it was poor threading.  Sadly  I will  return  2nd dress but very beautiful.
2.0,"Style is cute, but the color is off. I ordered the pink (coral) color, and it is very orange. Not as pictured."
2.0,I will use this to sleep in. Not to wear around the house. It is so loose around the neck area. I will sew the front to make it more comfortable. This will be my one and only purchase. Rating is -1
2.0,"not as expected, but it is cute"
2.0,If you have small ears this isn’t going to work for you.
2.0,"too small, too thin. Did not fit male size 11 feet."
2.0,"Cons<br />I thought they were going to come with a lot more. The item description should be more specific.<br />Just go to Walmart and get them. I won't be buying from this company again.<br />Pros<br />I've bought this brand before, and as for parents choice, it's good enough for a pull up. The fit was fine."
2.0,"The fabric on these is nice and soft. Problem with these is that they are for juniors, not women even though they give women's sizes as a choice. They were way too small for me and I'm a 4-6."
2.0,Poor quality!! The dress came out of the package with the stitching by the neck ripped! The material around the neck is too loose as well. Disappointed....but then I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,These earrings look real good but one of the post were bent. I don't think these are real silver either. They look plated & have a BS 925 stamped on them. Never seen BS stamped on silver before & it looks like it might be. I bent the post back so it's straight so we'll see if they last
2.0,"Meh.... It is a really cute design but the metal is so, so, so cheap looking. I know the price was very cheap too, but it was a waste as the piece just looks gaudy."
2.0,I like this dress. It’s nice material and pretty but it came with a large pink stain on it and very big in size.
2.0,"Once again, I must return.  Most of these cheap online dresses run 2 sizes too small...too bad it was lovely."
2.0,Didn't last a whole a season. Bought one for both of my boys and they both did the same thing. The zipper broke
2.0,"They were ok, but sweat was a problem in spring/summer heat."
2.0,"Good quality, but not worth paying 3 times the price of an &#34;average&#34; wallet."
2.0,I am 5’ 8”. The dress is really designed for under 5’5”. Pockets hit at waist. Arms are snug and a bit short in length.
2.0,Came with a fold in the print which sucked.
2.0,They were darling. But my daughter had a hard time getting her ear in. And getting them to stay on. She is 12.
2.0,"Cute, but wouldn’t stay on my feet.  The quality of Steve Madden has really gone down.  I’ve noticed the last few shoes I’ve bought from them seemed cheap and were uncomfortable."
2.0,Looks better in pictures than in person
2.0,"They break very easily. I handled them gently and they broke while I was putting them in my ears after my third time of wearing them. I really loved the design, but I was truely frustrated with the fact that i couldnt enjoy them for very long."
2.0,The earring was beautiful and good size but when I pushed it in it didn't feel tight enough. I made sure I pushed it in all the way and sure enough it pop off with in 24hrs and I lost it. Obviously disappointed.
2.0,They are called no show socks but they come up a lot higher than others so they do show with Toms or flats and my feet are somewhat large so I was surprised.  I ended up returning them.
2.0,"Beautiful shirt, but I ordered a 2X and it’s still a little small."
2.0,It did not hold up after one wash. The writing began peeling up. I hand washed in cold water inside out and let it air dry. I am so disappointed because I loved this shirt.
2.0,"glasses definitely look good, but mine came with the frame bent up and when I put them on my face, you can tell the frame is off because the glasses just sit awkwardly off balance and it's obvious. wish the quality of the frame was better or that the packaging had been better so they didn't come bent up.."
2.0,These do not stay put on the leg.  A bit disappointing in the cold weather we've experienced here.  I put them under wool socks - and I honestly don't think it made a difference.
2.0,"Very heavy, long and it looked like a fish was sucking on my ear."
2.0,Sleeves are too short as this is a 3x size. Used for workout 's.
2.0,Too thing and pant length is too long
2.0,Ordered xl. It fits like a med. It is cute and lined.
2.0,I wear a DD and for a large and it was waaaaay too small. Plus the fur in the bra wasn’t thick at all as it appears in the pictures!
2.0,Watch band does not stand up to a preschooler's normal wear and tear.
2.0,"This is a good, solid, heavy fitbit band. I loved it, but the clasp broke after only about 4 months use."
2.0,"I wanted to love this badly. I've been on the hunt for a sports bra that can be racerback, has a back closure and underwire and doesn't 'look like a bra' so that I feel comfortable w/ a muscle tee over it at the gym without feeling like I'm underdressed. It's a challenge. I previously purchased this in 32DD and it was too snug on the band so I ordered a new one in 34DD and was shocked that I could not close this one either without a fight. I then measured the band and it is 28 inches and not enough stretch to work for 34 nor 32 band. I measured my 32DD and the band on that is 26 inches. I can't possibly express how badly I wanted this to work. I'm at a loss as to what to try next. Everything else about the item is great and has what I was looking for."
2.0,"This skirt is very unflattering, the fabric is scratchy, and the pictures are deceiving. The photo they show of a red skirt on the mannequin form has a flat front waistband that helps to minimize the ""poof"" of the fabric flowing down. In reality, the skirt has a scrunchy waistband all the way around that causes the fabric to gather in an unflattering way creating the illusion of having a muffin top. The skirt did seem to be made very well otherwise and the fabric was not see through under the chiffon layer. I've included photos of the actual product and what a more fitted skirt looks like with my figure."
2.0,Cheap looking and kind of see through. Not the same suit as pictured.  Still cute though.
2.0,"10 out of the 40 in the package did not work... good thing we had more than we needed for the party. I guess this should be expected when you buy cheap crap, and these are definitely crap."
2.0,"Arms Runs small, It looks like a Mans shirt not cut for a lady's figure what so ever<br />At first i laughed Really thought they sent me a mans shirt<br />I thought ok i will just sleep in it But then the arms ran sooo small soooo<br />I ended up giving it to my neice"
2.0,"I purchased this set about a month ago. The fit felt fine but I noticed today that it fell out. I suppose that's the reason these covers come in a set of 2. Unfortunately, I already gave the other one to a family member thinking I wouldn't need 2.  Not worth the money."
2.0,Solid blue no design what so ever
2.0,Fits good for my kids but way too small for an adult male
2.0,"not supportive at all.  They are comfy for a slipper, perhaps."
2.0,Bent. Not as nice as expected
2.0,"Not great quality the outside is soft but the inside is scratchy, im gonna wear it but wouldn't buy it again. There's definitely better out there for the price. I got a medium and it fits good a little loose (which I wanted)"
2.0,I liked the slippers but they were too small - I am size 12 and it said 11-12.
2.0,It continually falls off the glasses
2.0,"I absolutely loved this dress; nice material and love the flare. However it runs very small - I’m a size 8/10 and would probably need a 14/16. I returned it but plan to order again for an event this year, in the right size of course.<br /><br />Update, I ordered the dress again in a larger size. It still didn’t fit well. When I went to return it, I would have to pay for the shipping - just FYI the price was $45, wasn’t worth returning so I’ll sell it or get it tailored to my liking."
2.0,"I did like the color and super light, but the cut for the arms is way too deep. Will clearly see all of your sports bra if wear this tank. A little more revealing than I'd like. Otherwise, decent tank overall and good for hot hot summers."
2.0,I was pretty disappointed to receive a very scuffed-up keychain that wasn't nearly as clear as the picture shows.
2.0,"Wanted to buy myself a black skeleton watch for a wedding and then casual wear. I stumbled on this watch and after looking around decided to get it. When the package came, it was slightly beat up but that is understandable. I opened the box and saw 3 things, the watch, a tool for resizing, and a bracelet? It was a Chinese bead bracelet. Whatever, just something I was not expecting.  A tag did come with the watch but it wasn't attached. It wasn't broken which i guess is a plus. First thing I noticed when trying the watch was it was too small for me. I looked for link extensions but found none. One of the links was misaligned which I had to realine. Then the clip itself caught my attention. If you don't unclip or clip then simultaneously you will have a issue. While the watch itself looked pretty good can't say I was happy about not being able to wear it. I will be returning it, and I have learned my lesson of buying anything of worth off of Amazon."
2.0,"These looked really good, but upon closer scrutiny I noticed that they aren't sewn very well and they stretched out to be way too big-not a big fan"
2.0,The design was messed up upon arrival. It is a good sturdy case and come with cloth
2.0,"Ran way too small, not flattering. Put it in the dryer to get the wrinkles out after air drying and the mesh completely disintegrated. They’re ruined after one wash."
2.0,This is really for persons who are petite and short.
2.0,Was surprised that the XXL was tight around my stomach.  I Ioved the color and the material and it fit around the arms and bust area very nicely. So if they offered larger sizes I would definitely do an exchange. Unfortunately they don’t. XXL is the largest
2.0,My foot sides around too much
2.0,These were nice and looked like the picture but they are so big I can't even wear them. I ordered the small one but think I got the big one.
2.0,"so to be perfectly honest the company sent an e-mail and asked for no reviews under 4 stars, but honestly they aren't bad, they fit about like the victoria secret i normally wear, they have a good fit, but its a grab pack.  they weren't that cute which i kind of expected, but I'm a B cup and come on, what B cup doesn't need a push up bra, there were 2 padded no push up and i would and i would hope there would be a variety, there really wasn't.  there was no strapless and no real cuteness. not great but i guess you get what you pay for.  I'm a risk taker and i have extra money, i just love clothes, so if you dont mind a bit of risk its ok.  the picture looks so cute you have to think you will get a cute one, not so much but again its a grab pack so take your chances based on your budget.  BEST OF LUCK"
2.0,"Normally, I wear x-sm or sm.  So I read reviews and ordered a small to be safe.  So snug in the chest and the arms!  I returned and ordered a large, and I swear there is barely a difference in the size.  I had not washed either.  I understand that it is a Junior's size, but wow!  Also, the large I ordered came with a hole in the side of it where the stitching was missed. Pretty disappointing for a Disney product that was $20 and so much trouble/hassle since it  arrived the first time."
2.0,The material feels like plastic
2.0,Cute but I ordered a large and it was too tight to wear over a bathing suit. Might work over a cami.
2.0,"The delivery was fast, But the quality is not worth $10 maybe $5.50. I wish there was more honest reviews prior to me purchasing. So now that I received the ring I can give the most honest feedback possible. The stem is long and a little difficult to adjust. You will spend several days adjusting the ring to your liking. Also the stub is slightly uncomfortable and maybe it’s because I wore my”starter piercing” for so long and it was small. But cubic zirconia does rub the top of the actual piercing and cause some uncomfortably, Hence the reason why I said you will need to adjust it over several days, lastly if it’s not adjusted properly it will slide out easily. Overall it’s not bad, just not worth $10"
2.0,Somewhat useful
2.0,Straight see through
2.0,Fabric not as thick as the white one with the same listing. Layover has no security so the dress flows open revealing the underskirt when walking.
2.0,Cheap quality. You get what you pay for!
2.0,"These just didn’t look very nice and they smelled funny. The plastic black clasp is very thin and looks like it could break easily. If you need a belt to keep your pants up that you don’t want anyone to see, this might work. However, I did plan on using these for the variety of golf pants that I have. They are way to cheap looking to use in that environment. I sent them back and picked a different Amazon stretch belt with a metal clasp."
2.0,Bought the largest they have and still too small for my large calves.
2.0,really short in the torso. not cute
2.0,Not very comfortable but pretty
2.0,"For the price it's a great band, but don't expect it to fit a Garmin Venu. I chose to keep it and will try to file it to fit."
2.0,Advertised as &#34;XLT &#34; but is only XL.  Upset to see false advertising.  Product is decent quality but too short.
2.0,Looks beautiful but broke apart after 20 minutes of wearing. The hook just fell off although it was on very lose. Wouldn't spend money on this again
2.0,this does not look good and looked terrible after one wash
2.0,"Cheap, flimsy.  Threw out"
2.0,Thought it would be more fitted
2.0,"The dress is pretty, the color I chose was emerald green, which is very beautiful, the fabric is quality however, the back is a lace-up, corset-like closure, and some of the loops were completely sewn. There is a thin line of sequins across the front of the dress which doesn't add to the dress but rather cheapens the appearance, If I were keeping the dress I would have the sequins removed.<br />The biggest drawback is even though a Prime customer the postage is not free therefore, returning the item is not free $$$"
2.0,"Great belt, exactly what I was looking for.  The only thing is that I had to add more holes in the belt (which I see were other complaints).  Must have been made for a person with an 18 inch waist.  Luckily there was room to spare."
2.0,This material is thin and the seams are weak... not that satisfied
2.0,"I ordered these glasses for our family vacation, because I thought they were cute and stylish, but I received a pair of men's black and orange sunglasses, so wasn't too happy about that two days before we left on vacation. The bag they were received in, had the correct description listed on the sticker, but the glasses were definitely not the CG Rhinestone glasses that I ordered, but rather a pair of black with bright orange trim sunglasses, that wrapped around your head!!"
2.0,"The good side of these is the color. It is beautiful and vibrant!  The down side is that these will not last long. The 1st time I wore these I had several snags on them just from my fingernails!  They snag over the smallest thing & they were very noticeable snags.  Very cheap fabric. You get what you pay for, I guess 🙄"
2.0,It is a week plastic. Fits nice and my boy still has a lot of fun with it
2.0,Not a great material. Don’t like cinching on arms. Wrinkles easily.
2.0,"Nose piece is very weird and makes them sit oddly on Your face, ordered 3 pairs and all 3 are jacked because of it."
2.0,"Horrible fit, not well made"
2.0,"These are really lovely and well made; however, they do not work for dresses. The clips are simply too small to hold fabric. Back they went."
2.0,"Good models, but bad glasses"
2.0,Wasn't happy about the material. Also wish the  tassels was thinner as different material not same as dress.
2.0,"I'll be returning the bracelet. It looks cheap and is flimsy.<br /><br />I toured the Murano factory several weeks ago, and loved their jewelry.  This is a total disappointment."
2.0,Very small cheap watches. Not for me but would work/look better for 8-15 year olds.
2.0,"My family has big hands.  I ordered xxxl gloves.  Normally xxxls fit just fine, or are slightly too long in the fingers, but we need the width.  These gloves by Bear Knuckles were way too short in the fingers, not even as long as a regular XL.  They were, however, wide enough for my large hands.  Fortunately, I have a friend with more normal hands, who now has a new pair of gloves.  So if you have wide hands and short stubby fingers, these gloves might work for you."
2.0,"My daughter got this to wear under dresses, but even in the right size it is very uncomfortable. When she sits down it compresses even more and folds in a way she doesn't like. It is secure and feels like quality material, but only really gives an hourglass shape if you are standing straight up, not bending over or sitting down. Overall wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"I got them to wear with my Sanuk loafers. They left a solid 1.5 inches of sock showing on the top of my foot. And I'm a size 10.5. I'd imagine it would be even more on smaller feet. They'd be fine for tennis shoes I guess. Quality seemed OK - not great, but OK. The care instructions said not to tumble dry which I thought was interesting. Who hang dries their socks?"
2.0,The material is cool and loose. The stitching is very cheaply done and it's not true to fit.
2.0,Very flimsy pleather 2 months in and ratchet is slipping
2.0,"This hoodie isn't great quality I wore it for the first time yesterday and the pocket stitching started coming apart. I only wore it for maybe 2 hours. If your still convinced be sure to either know a good tailor NEVER use the pockets , not even to place a phone in."
2.0,Nice jacket if it weren't 3 sizes too small.  I bought the ladies XL which should be a size13/14.  It is actually only about a size 7/8.
2.0,"Liked the strap band, the ""updated"" nose piece is thin hard plastic that has 4 points that stab into your nose. The lenses fog if you get any of the inside wet which happens if you take them off and put them back on after taking a break from the pain the nose piece causes. Do not recommend"
2.0,Love this ring but have ordered two and both have had issues with the stone falling out. My jeweler said the prongs are not strong enough and more are needed due to the stone not being symmetrical.
2.0,"Obviously cheap, not really wearable as it’s too bulky. Cool to have and play with/ show but not good enough quality to gift people."
2.0,After wearing these for a few weeks the top part started to peel off. I tried to glue it back but it’s not holding and just getting worse. Aside from that I do like that they are easy for my 4 year old to put on himself and comfortable.
2.0,I usually buy more expensive shoes and I see why.  These are very inexpensive and the quickness of how they wear out shows it.  My son wears Sketchers until he grows out of them. These had holes in four weeks.
2.0,The cups were pointy and weird
2.0,My daughter is 16 and these didn’t fit. Way too small. This product is definitely not for adults.
2.0,"They were huge, for the size they said. The material is soft, but I can tell that washing will wear them quickly. Definitely don't dry them!"
2.0,Nose piece is hard plastic not rubber so it bounces on the bridge of my nose when it’s bumpy!
2.0,"I ordered a medium and this fits more like a large. It is also so see through that I can’t even wear it out. I attached photos and you can see the tag inside is seen through the material easily, and you can also see my hand through the material as well.<br /><br />I also don’t love the neckline, it’s just not very flattering. The spot where the ‘X’ is on the material is just extra fabric on top of the bottom of the v-neck which honestly just looks cheap. The material is comfortable, but overall the shirt just wasn’t what I was expecting.<br /><br />If you are fine with wearing a bralette underneath and having it show, this may be something you would like. It just wasn’t for me. Definitely looks better on the models in the product photos. Maybe a different color would be less see through, but for my outfit I needed a cream or white color. Unfortunately I had to order something different and I don’t know what I’ll do with this yet."
2.0,the reason I bought these was so I could put a heating pouch in them at my fingertips where regular gloves you can't. when I received<br /> them I found out that they have individual fingers just like a glove so I can't use them. They are fine just not what I needed them for.
2.0,The color was not as expected.  The fabric made the dress look cheap.
2.0,The one onesie ripped before we even put it on.
2.0,"The top looks like a bra and does not fit well at all, you have to wear it with the push up inserts to make it lay properly and it is not comfortable. The thin straps at the top, do not give much support if you need it. I liked the bottoms, they hit me about mid waist, a little lower than other high waisted suits I have tried. Overall, its just okay and it didn't work for me."
2.0,These pants run really big and are super wide legged... I returned them with no problems...
2.0,They’re smooth and really don’t grip.
2.0,"Fit great, loved the style- however the shoes had a few dark marks on them."
2.0,not my size but is a really nice crop shirt
2.0,"the jacket is very small and the fabric is not good quality, sorry"
2.0,It came apart after wearing it only for about a week. I went to put it on and my head went right through. I know how to crochet and knit but that's not why I bought it.
2.0,stretchy silky material. ran a bit small but the shape is not flattering. color was off as well.
2.0,"It does its job well and has those essential oils smelling great around me all day. Wonderful. Looks great too.<br /><br />UPDATE****<br />The elasticated yarn used to hold the bracelet together is very cheap and finally snapped this morning sending the beads all over my car before my trip to work.  I am going to have to put the piece back together myself using a more durable cord, (if i can find the Tiger Eye which rolled under a seat somewhere). It is not like I was wearing it everyday either!! Due to this my rating must go down as I only bought it a couple of months ago."
2.0,The onesie was tight but the leggings did not fit nor did the tutu.
2.0,broke the first day and paw print way bigger then pictured
2.0,"Not very good quality. Within an hour of just basic household things, the band bent and a gem fell out. Not pleased"
2.0,Too long in the length for a  small and extra small in the bust area.
2.0,Product is too heavy!
2.0,Items are very large and boxy! Not very cute. Fabric wasnt very soft.
2.0,My black pair came broken :(
2.0,Disappointed with the bracelets I received. Half of them did not even fit my wrist and were constructed poorly. I was going to return them but ended up forgetting. There was maybe one in the entire set that I would actually wear.
2.0,"The band came with zero instructions. Once I found a YouTube video I had no trouble replacing the band, I would have never figured out the antenna on my own.<br />The other MAJOR issue is the band itself. The material is substantially stiffer / harder than the original Fitbit material which causes it to not fit as well as the original material band did."
2.0,"They slide off a lot, which is a shame. They are pretty."
2.0,These look very cheap. I don’t recommend anyone buying them unless you’re making a bracelet for a teenage girl.
2.0,"This is stretch a waist, which is not mentioned in the description. They are very lightweight, which might have been fine, but I was not expecting that at all."
2.0,"Cheaply made, not great compression & WAY too big (even after washing). I have normal sized women’s feet and thicker calves, but still in “normal” range. These could easily go over my knees! And are too large in the foot area to provide ANY type of compression. Should have returned."
2.0,Way too baggy.
2.0,"These shorts were a bizarre size.  They were a bit small on the waist for a 34 but not terrible.  The length was perfect for me.  The huge issue was the width of the legs.  I'm 6'4&#34; and fit and these things hugged my legs like compression shorts.  My wife joked that they were compression cargo shorts. I've never encountered that before.<br />Obviously, i'm returning them."
2.0,"I bought this rain coat for a trip to Mexico. Bought an XXL to fit myself and my large backpack. Got caught in a rain storm the second day of my trip. Put on the rain coat for my 3 mile walk home. Covered myself and my backpack perfectly. Kept everything dry, was extremely lightweight and well-ventilated. I wasn't sweating profusely like most rain gear causes me to do!<br /><br />Got to my destination and waited for the rain to stop. Shook off the jacket and folded it back into the small pocket pouch. When I took it out the next day to wear again in the rain I noticed the orange color had bled all over the jacket. Very disappointed. The jacket had worked so well! If it weren't for the colors bleeding together this would be a great jacket. Unfortunately it's ruined because of the color bleeding all over."
2.0,Runs way too small. I ordered an 3XL and it fit like a m-l. The fabric was good quality and would keep one warm just was too small to even enjoy it fully.
2.0,Wouldn't recommend......my son wore it for 1 hour and the ear part came off. The mask ripped easily.
2.0,"I just got the shirt in the mail and I don't approve. The shirt has a lot of lose threads on it. As well as, the shoulder are a bit tight. I recommend sizing up if you have broader shoulders."
2.0,The material is really hard. The color purple Needs to be more prominent. I had to return this.
2.0,I love the design but I wore it and it has pilling everywhere. Didn’t even make it to the laundry before it started. It’s very soft and comfortable but the material is cheap and hasn’t held up even after one wear. Pretty disappointed.
2.0,"Just received this clutch, and I'm very disappointed. I ordered a black one, and stitching  is in white thread stitched horribly.  Had the stitching not been bad, I'd keep it, but sadly I'm returning it. I ordered 5 of these previously from a different merchant as gifts and those had no issues with the stitching. I'll reorder from them instead."
2.0,"My daughter is a huge Hermione Granger fan.  Great little packaged gift; come with red little satin bag. We gave this along with a Cruikshank's cat for Christmas. Unfortunately, it broke on her first time wearing.  She was so upset."
2.0,I ordered 5 pair. They delivered 4 pair and a finger toy. WTH!? And of the 4 pair I ordered only 2 pair were the ones I actually ordered. Someone owes me a free pair of socks. On a positive note. I love the socks.
2.0,PENDANT NOT SMOOTH - HAD ROUGH JAGGED TOUCH  WHICH WOULD HAVE PICKED CLOTHES OR SKIN.
2.0,"I thought the stone was ok but, the chain was very cheap. Unfortunately, my chain was broken upon opening. I probably will not order again."
2.0,Too Short.
2.0,"My son was initially happy with new shoes but soon the wear and tear happens starting third wear only. The sticky flap loose the stickiness very soon and that makes me realise, it was not a good choice."
2.0,Runs very small.  Grandson wears a 2T so bought a 3T/4T and it does not fit
2.0,"odd thing about these, they came as 2 pack, white ones are comfy and roomy.  black ones are soooo uncomfortable, the straps on top are tight and dig in to tops of your feet.  So, I want to keep the whites and return the blacks but I don't think it works that way.  Also, this is not my first pair of Tony's sandals, they really do have a nice arch support considering they are flip flops."
2.0,"I'm usually a small, I ordered a medium based on other reviews and because I wanted it to be a bit oversized. It was snug with a hoodie under it and I ordered a size up...<br />Also the button holes are huge, the buttons are small, it has no pockets and the liner sounds like crinkling paper.<br />The outside is cute and soft, decent look to it.<br />But because of the stuff I mentioned, I pretty much hate this coat and am giving it to a friend. Hopefully, they'll hate it less."
2.0,"Pros<br />Soft, cushiony inside<br /><br />Cons<br />Ran at least a half a size too large on me<br />Colors were very dull and drab in person"
2.0,It was a pretty set but no earring backs were included
2.0,Great material but roles down on thicker thighs.  I was not able to wear it with the dress I was hoping to wear it with.
2.0,Thought it was nice except the collar around the neck ripped day 1 of wearing it.
2.0,"So first off, whomever numbered the rounds cannot count. There's an extra 6 between 9 and 10 (you can actually see this on the default picture here on Amazon).<br /><br />Also, we were missing one of the running back sheets and had a duplicate of one of the others.<br /><br />Lots of the stickers also didn't come off the sheet very well."
2.0,"This is a woman's shirt, not a man's."
2.0,"A 3rd of them were black lives matter pieces. The picture looked kid friendly, but there were some that were definitely not, like the ""wap"" piece. Parents beware, I guess"
2.0,"After just a little over a month (and too late to return) the metal circle on the clutch that protects the fabric around the wrist clasp broke off.  And this was under normal use.  So now I have to use it without the wrist attachment because if I don't the fabric looks like it will continue to stretch until it tears.  Which is ok, but now there's an ugly hole on the side of the clutch.  Other than that, the clutch was of perfect size but I would not buy again."
2.0,Came tangled up.  One part is off and doesn't look right.  I'll have to fix it myself.
2.0,should have known by the price. They turned black with in weeks. They have no shine to it at all
2.0,Loved the fabric. The arms were too small. :(
2.0,This was way too large but did fit my neighbor who weighs 285 lbs
2.0,I am normally a large and knew Jersey ran small so ordered a 2xl and it still a little small.
2.0,The lining of the dress was cut very strangely and it was visibly noticeable in the bodice.
2.0,"I do like the material that these socks are made out of, but they run VERY small and are a bit on the tight side.  These are the same size socks I always buy, but the fit is significantly smaller."
2.0,"2 stars simply because it was super cute, but super tight."
2.0,The bands were very tight. Some of my peers with big muscular arms had a hard time putting on and keeping them on. They would cut off circulation. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Runs small and doesn’t have great stretch to it. I ordered a large thinking they were high waisted and I couldn’t bend over without my butt showing.
2.0,It took long to receive and the workmanship is poor.  I suspect the zipper will  fail shortly.  The sewing was poor.  The tags were in Chinese so I couldn't read what it was made of or washing instructions.  The color was ugly.
2.0,Not very slim
2.0,"The boot is oddly attractive in it's unusual design. The color (I got red) is rich and vibrant. Beautiful leather. Stitching for the most part is flawlessly done. The boots look like an artisan took the time to make them by hand. One of the most distinctive features is unfortunately the least attractive in reality. The circular seam across the front tip of the boot looks really cool in most photos. But in real live appearance, it is unavoidably ugly. It's immediately noticeable and impossible to unsee. The seams reveal the unfinished rawhide insides of the leather. This exposed rawhide is uneven and jagged, giving the appearance of a rough gash. It looks like the village cobbler ran out of material and made a makeshift patch at each boot tip.<br />The sole of the boot is a soft rubber. While it's flexibility may seem like a good thing for comfort (you could literally fold the boot in half from front to back), it's a nightmare for durability. I walked up and down the hallway for less than 10 minutes and the soles actually wore down a little! No, not just some dust from the floor -- upon wiping the soles clean, the rubber had clearly worn down from a few minutes of strolling on an indoor vinyl floor! I don't see how these could last a day outside on concrete.<br />The boots felt very comfy on my feet while sitting. I could wiggle my toes freely in the wide toebox. But upon standing up and walking, I could immediately feel that something was wrong with one boot. The right foot was perfectly comfortable but the left boot had a dent on one side of the toe box that kept rubbing my big toe. Also that left boot felt like there was something hard under my heel. The left heel did not feel level and I could feel my foot rolling slightly inward on each step, trying to find equilibrium. After a few minutes of walking indoors, it was clear that this was a situation that would only worsen with further wear.<br />Now way could I keep and wear these without soon expecting damage to both the boots and my feet."
2.0,cute but it is way to bit to sit where it needs to on the wrist.
2.0,"While the mask is creepy, it was not the same color as was advertised in the picture. The face, as pictured, is a nice shade of baby blue instead of the pale white/grey corpse tone. Based off some other reviews, this seems to be a random occurance. Actual received product also appears to be of a lesser quality than the picture. So definately a Buyer Beware situation."
2.0,very cheaply made. buckle and front tab lack the strength you need.  Better to spend more and get something more substantial... another case of getting what you pay for.
2.0,"This fabric is so thin, only way I can wear this is as a nightgown, or with a leotard under it, which I might but it's not what I wanted. Love the cut and the style but fabric is too thin to wear it out in public."
2.0,A low end printed mask.
2.0,"Not crazy about these either. They're cute, but perhaps just not for me."
2.0,"The bag was very cute and was a good size.  It was a bit scratchy and the straps were not very secure.  I used it as a carry-on bag and was then going to use it as a pool bag.  Sadly, the straps broke while at the airport and I never got to use it as a pool bag.  I did get a compliment on it at the airport, but I would only recommend it if you plan on putting very light things in it."
2.0,"Nice fit, Style, softness of material and color are great.  I'm 5'2"" weigh about 135#.  I purchased a ""Large"". Unfortunately after I washed it I discovered holes around the bottom of the dress.  So disappointing.  I'm returning it today."
2.0,"Only one will go in, but the other won't budge. I bought these as a thought that the flares would be a normal size, but I'll tear my ears on these. Definitely won't buy it again, and I'm disappointed because they were cute."
2.0,"It's a cool looking ring but it doesn't like what is advertised. The whole row of black cz looks to be painted over, but for the price what's you gonna do?"
2.0,"The photo gives the impression that they are much more solid and larger than they are. I was disappointed by the feel, and the size. just generally unimpressive. I have ordered a few cufflinks; all those above $25 look good, so I say it's better to spend a little more and get decent sized cufflinks."
2.0,"These are cute but they are definitely not ‘nonslip’. I bought them for when I play sports but they constantly slip off. They are good just to wear when you are not very active; aside from that, no."
2.0,I liked the pattern but aside from that they are just any ole cheap pair of gloves. They didn’t work with my phone and they didn’t keep my fingers warm at all.
2.0,You must be a certain size or it won't look right
2.0,It was really cute and I ordered a large because it said they run small. Well the bottems were a little big and the tops was way too small!
2.0,"While the drop is dainty and pretty, the chain is terrible.  It is supposedly .925 sterling; but it turned black the first time it was worn and it will not clean up.  I've rubbed it with a silver polishing rag and put it in an ultrasonic cleaner that has successfully polished my other silver pieces beautifully.  The chain also grabs and tangles my hair.  Very disappointed with the lack of quality of the chain!"
2.0,I must have been excited that I found these. They would be great if I had a giant head.  They are about twice the size I needed.
2.0,Feels very cheaply made does not feel like it will hold up  during use
2.0,Susenstone fashion cross braided Wooden Bead Wrist Bracelet Leather Jewelry.  Just received this item 5 minutes ago.  open it to try it on and if fell apart on me.  In am truly disappointed.  I realized that it is only $2.00 but I expected it to last me a bit longer than 5 minutes.  Now I am afraid to open the other one.  Pray for me.
2.0,"If I’m going to be honest, I buy a lot of vintage clothing from amazon and this is probably the most disappointing I’ve recoeved. I was sent the incorrect size, I’m a very petite person and the medium they sent me instead of the small was ridiculously big. The best is the saving grace but it doesn’t fix the issues with the chest area being very large. The material is stiff, but it’s not terrible. The biggest issue I have with this dress are the sleeves. The arm holes are HUGE and cause you to be able to see into the dress. This is probably mostly due to the size being far too large but I feel like it’s also partially due to the design."
2.0,Cheap. I wouldn’t bother. The plastic braces as the side poked through on its second wear.
2.0,The lace was missing at the bottom and the button holes were not cut. The coat itself is pretty.
2.0,"size 10-12 run small, but  she likes them, and says they are comfortable, hasnt noticed loose strings, or holes, so we'll see how they wash. May update and give a better review.<br />UPDATE: first wash shows catastrophic failure on the sewing. I'm thanking GOD this didnt happen at SCHOOL!! She wont be wearing these until their second wash, and thorough inspection."
2.0,"So, I mistakenly bought these for an international flight without the knowledge that vented face masks are not allowed on flights, no biggie, that was my mistake and does not impact my ratings. However, the filters are way too small and don't cover enough of the mask. They're about maybe 75% of the size of the mask and have the tendency to fold up inside itself. The adjustable straps have the tendency to get tangled in my hair. The nose bridge is pretty small and weak, if you wear glasses this is an instant no - there's no way to close that gap and seal the mask properly, which is why I give it 2 stars."
2.0,"It’s not even that it’s not designed for ppl with bigger boobs. The shirt could be better designed, the string is so high up that it doesn’t hold ur boobs together at all, it’s like riding a necklace. The shirt should atleast provide SOME comfort it provides none it feels like someone could blow on my shirt and it’ll rise. I wouldn’t be able to walk or move without a nip slip or revealing my whole boob. And the under arms need to be tighter there is so much room i took a picture of what it SHOULD look like when i’m pulling it with my thumb and i showed what it looks like normally in the first pic. If u guys moved the strings down it would probably be better and fixed the under arms"
2.0,"Not at all soft even after several washes, not comfortable,  fit is poofie"
2.0,"I wear a men's XL, and bought an XXL; I'll bust the zipper if I take a deep breath."
2.0,If your looking for a wave cap dont buy this cause the seam is on the camo side. Its not a reverserable du rag. So turning it inside out hides the seam but then it hides the camo logo.
2.0,Model must be very short<br />I'm 5'4 and reached way way above my ankles about mid calf.<br />Another false advertising by &#34;Asian&#34; marketing
2.0,"I shoulda known! The size is ok, but there is very little extra material to make the skirt flowy. See through, you'll need to wear leggings underneath."
2.0,"The nose ring was what I was looking for, however after less than a week the Black color coating peels right off very disappointing."
2.0,These are not the headbands that are featured. The ones we received were too thin and short. I gave them two stars because they can at least be used for kids.
2.0,"Nice, but much smaller than expected."
2.0,"Cute shoes, but they fell apart within a few weeks. The tag on the back ripped off on one shoe, the laces tore on the other, and overall they looked worn out and scuffed. They were only worn by a barely-walking baby who is under a year old, so I feel they should have held up better."
2.0,"I ordered a small and received a large which is too big, kinda hangs on me.  I normally wear size small, but realize that Asian clothing runs small.  Also, although the fabric is cotton and spandex, it is way too flimsy.  It really is cheap feeling and looks cheap as well. I don't know how to insert a product link, or I would do so."
2.0,Way too small!  I bought this in a size SMALL for a 12 yer old girl about 5 feet tall and 90 lbs.  It looks like a blouse and the the garterized part of the top does not even go on the shoulders.  It would function better as a restraint than a dress.  Cute style though if it fit.
2.0,"Quality was not good, runs small in the shoulders."
2.0,"So, it's okay material. I ordered the large, and the top did NOT fit me. it took two of my friends to help me force it on just to see how it all looks, and it squeezes all fat!! the bottoms fit perfectly but not the top? it's as if the top is a medium and bottoms are large."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. For those that don't know silk, it feels very nice. For those that know, it feel like a cheep party table cloth. Fit is great."
2.0,The watch band  would be of use to a 5 year old.  Too small for a man.
2.0,"I normally wear a medium, but had recent stomach surgery, so I need something loose. I bought the large thinking it would  loose, but not baggy. I am 5'2, 140lbs and still losing weight. I should have sent it back, but I'll give it to a friend. Sending things back is a hassle, Plus the dress was super long on me. If your 5'8, this might work for you. I am not a fan of the material nor the fit."
2.0,"I actually bought two of these.  The first was too large and I realized that it was only being secured by a very small portion of the hook and loop fastener so I bought another in the next smaller size.<br /><br />First, let me say that the leather on these belts is reallly excellent -- it is as nice a belt as I have encountered.  Too bad they didn't go for the same quality in the hook and loop fastener.  I noticed from the beginning that it seemed awfully easy to &#34;unlatch&#34; the belt but after a few days of wearing it, I noticed that I started having some difficulty securing the belt.  I would press the two halves together and it would then immediately pop apart.I thought I must not be sealing the halves well enough.  Then, one day I bent over and felt the belt slip -- it was still latched but now too loose to hold my pants up.  Luckily, I caught the pants before they fell but now I don't trust the belt at all.  Who ever heard of a hook and loop fastener which can slip?  I've seen Velcro that I'm sure I could have hung a 25lb weight on a wall and worried more about whether the dry wall would hold than whether the Velcro would hold.  I don't know where they got the crappy fastener which they used on this belt but for almost $50, they definitely should have done better.  Now I have two $50 belts which I can't wear.  I'd recommend that you stay far away from this.  Great leather, though."
2.0,"Cute and well fitting, BUT the fabric never softened after 8 washings. NO drying allowed. I tried it once for a few minutes and it was softened slightly, but it did shrink 1 size, yikes.  Disappointed :("
2.0,I purchased this watch band 3 months ago and it has sadly broke!  It wasn't from abuse or neglect.  I am disappointed since I got so many compliments on it.  It is too late to return it but it should be a lot stronger than to last only 90 days.
2.0,The face is way too big to be worn by an adult-- or at least a working one in a relatively conservatively dressed city like Washington DC.  We returned.  Tooo bad the blue color was fabulous.
2.0,"Fabric was soft and smooth, but underwire was very uncomfortable. Little support and bounce while cups allowed for spillage at top.  Bought others at same time in same size, did not have cup issues in the others"
2.0,Doesn’t stay on when you remove the hair tie from it. Also flips around all the time so hair type is in front so kind of ugly. Good concept but not as convenient as I had hoped.
2.0,Runs large. Way more orange than pictured and very shiny.
2.0,I waited weeks for this head band. It came broken. I had to use tools to put it back together. Very pretty now that it is together.
2.0,Would be perfect for somone with a long torso and either  small bust or large fake ones. Fabric left over at top after I put it on and there is not enough cup coverage at the top. Had to return it.
2.0,"It didn't last. Soft, great cut and deep pockets, I really liked this dress for around the house and running errands... But the fatal flaw was bad stitching.  It lasted only three washes, even though I followed the washing instructions."
2.0,"Makeup was hard to use and didn't stick well, tattoos didn't stick well and were hard to use in conjunction with makeup"
2.0,"Super cute but do not last. They fell apart within the first wear or two. Ribbons come unraveled, heart charm comes off, and I had to reglue one to the clip right when we got it."
2.0,"Hola buenas tardes!compre 3 relojes mulco  Muy bonitos, pero uno de ellos  no es el color rojo intenso que se muestra en la foto para la venta es un color  más claro! Casi color naranja<br />Lastima que no sea rojo Ferrari 😃☺️ Gracias !"
2.0,Although the over all quality is very nice the elastic  in the upper part is just too tight.. i am under weight & have very thin legs and they are even too tight for me. I need socks but sadly i think because of this i’ll have to give them all away.
2.0,Pockets are horrible. Inside material is kind of scratchy. I do not recommend
2.0,I loved this necklace and received many compliments on it. I only wore it a handful of times and then it fell apart. Very disappointed.
2.0,too large for my arms
2.0,"The top fits every where except the cup. According to the size chart the large should have for me well. I'm a 36 DD, the cups were probably a Large C at best."
2.0,I thought that they would have been larger than they are. Not satisfied with how small they are.
2.0,"Came broken, lights don’t work mask thin and cracked"
2.0,"There are not many Born shoes I don't like but these are one of them. They are not very comfortable, they cut into your feet and they don't look as nice on. I returned them."
2.0,"Great product, however when I received it the tip of the crystal was broke Off and the broken piece was not in the box."
2.0,Definitely not looks like the picture super small and hard to see the details
2.0,"Doesn't like at all, cheap quality, does not even come in a box."
2.0,Very slim def not one size fits all
2.0,One stone was not on the mount when I received the package. I was able to return it for a full refund.
2.0,"Not stretchy material, more like cloth and not regular swimsuit material, runs small"
2.0,Thin material.  Ordered two sizes up and it still didnt fit.
2.0,After 1 year using: poor quality on the materials and it looks like a very cheap portfolio.
2.0,"For reference. 5'8 and 260lbs . Heavier bottom built. Purchased 2XL . Jacket is way too small, appeared to be<br />a small or medium. Short on the arms & tight. Bottoms fit length wise but can be a little ""sheer"" or appears stretched out on the ""butt"" part. Purchased the suit in the color purple. Color is beautiful. Material wasn't scratchy or itchy . Would recommend if you wanted a track suit feel with bagginess on the arms then purchase twice  your size. Also, clothes do not state tag size so unknown if you've received the size that you actually purchased. Just have to trust the vendor. Defiantly returned & will not repurchase"
2.0,"Bottoms were huge, way to long, had to sew them so my daughter could wear it."
2.0,"Love knot tops but not this one. First of all took about 5-6 weeks to arrive. Tried it on, neck was too constricting; I don't like too low cut but need to be able to breathe! Also between the fabric and the knot location/style, it pouffed out right at my belly- making me look pregnant. Others that I have drape nicely and are flattering, this was not either. Returning, hopefully- amazon says my window for returns closed a week or so before I got the item, but they seemed to accept it so will see. Still have to pay $3+ for return postage though, annoying. Won't order from this seller again."
2.0,Quality was cheap and not good
2.0,You CAN NOT buy replacement lenses for this item! I will not purchase again.
2.0,I've changed my band many times. The spot the connector goes into is very open and makes it really hard to get the connector to stay in place while attaching the wristband. I sent it back.
2.0,"The zipper is difficult to close.  The lining of the jacket gets stuck in the zipper very easily.  I repaired it by tacking down the lining.  Fortunately I can sew.  The jackets waist has decorative pull that should really be functional.  I repaired this by detaching it to make it functional.  Now the waist is adjustable.  The jacket is light weight and probably not suitable for sub zero temperatures.  If you can't sew, probably skip buying this jacket.  After the repairs I made,  the jacket is functional, but not fabulous."
2.0,Bought these so I could be like Josh dun in that one Vine. They worked great but after putting them on and then taking them off a couple times somehow the wires andalites got tangled and I could never get them undone from inside the sleeve of the glove. Ended up having to cut the gloves open and I retrieve the lights but it would cost?
2.0,Although the straps are adjustable it’s still just too big!
2.0,"These glasses broke off at the hinge on the left side. Tried to fix, but the metal hinge completely broke off."
2.0,"Nice well made glasses. The base lens is BROWN. I had asked the Amazon community for advice regarding the color of the base lens. I was told these were  &#34;GREY&#34;. They are NOT. I purchased these glasses based on the pictures included on this site as well as, the Amazon Community.<br />I have since returned these for refund."
2.0,"wore these for one day and for whatever reason, caused my piercing that I’ve had for 20yrs to become so sore I couldn’t wear earrings for over a week. Maybe the way the hook is, but I’ve worn earrings with a slight curve to it. Will never wear again and too late for a return I suppose."
2.0,thin thin thin
2.0,It runs small & I wear a size 14. I ordered an X-Large.
2.0,"Disposable, cheap, stinks and doesn't last. only good  for a few times."
2.0,I love being able to organize my suitcase for travel.  I can fit quite a bit of clothes into each cube.  Unfortunately the quality lacks some.  There are loose threads already showing and one of the cubes has already torn near the zipper.
2.0,Not a fan of these at all. They don't stay up. If you want socks to keep your boots from rubbing your legs keep shopping!
2.0,It's beautiful!  I love it!<br /><br />Well...I LOVED it.  I only got to wear it once.  The first time I ordered this bracelet the clasp would not close so I sent it back and received a new one in a very timely manner.<br /><br />The first time I wore it the clasp broke.  A lady at the local grocery store found the clasp but the rest of the bracelet has never been found.  Probably lost in the snow and then scooped into a pile.
2.0,"The first one, which I returned had a ripped seam in the skirt.<br />Waiting for replacement"
2.0,Nothing wrong with the seller or shipment but I'm pretty sure these ear rings are not sterling silver but silver overlays. The back of the pair I got the sliver worn off or chipped off. Pretty but misleading!!
2.0,Button fell off when I pulled it out of the bag😳
2.0,"I have switched out all of my jean pants/shorts for Wallflower and I have to say this particular style sucks!! It isn't stretchy like the other styles - too small in the calf area and a huge gap in the waist area (I'm 5'4&#34;, 125 lb and always order a size 5) disappointed, really wanted some nice black jeans"
2.0,I bought a size up from my regular size bc I like my pjs to be roomy to sleep in and the shorts were still uncomfortably tight. Then there’s tags in the shorts and shirt that are so hard and itchy and the only way to get them completely out is to cut the seams which opens a hole in the fabric that I had to sew back together. Super annoying. I know they’re cheap pjs but cmon...
2.0,"The color was nice, but I hated the material and it ran small. I returned it."
2.0,I would had really liked them if they hadn't been too small.
2.0,They are beautiful but they open each day my daughter would bring back saying I dint touch but it was open n my friend told me.
2.0,"The shoe was okay, I wouldn't recommend it for sports its two part design makes it lack support and hard plastic makes you foot sweat alot."
2.0,"I purchased this top because I wanted a larger stone for my dermal anchor piercing. The diameter of the stone is larger, but the number of facets cut into it are the same as the smaller diameter top. Resulting in a flatter, less sparkly, cheaper looking stone. It looks cheesy.  I'll keep it as a backup but I already switched back to the smaller diameter stone."
2.0,"The reflective material works excellent! This is just like the $300 anti-papparazi jackets that Hollywood stars sometime wear to prevent pics being taken of them. I took away 3 stars for the incorrect sizing. My 5XL is closer to a USA Large. Not at all like the sizing chart indicates. Maybe they meant kid sizes? I would suggest maybe ordering 4-5 sizes larger than you normally wear. Regardless, it doesn't fit at all and is way too tight around the arms and waist."
2.0,"Disappointed. The plastic is super flimsy (imagine a clear shower curtain), so not only is it hard to see out of, but if you're walking outside, the plastic keeps blowing into your face. You end up having to touch it in order to keep it off your face, because otherwise your breath will leave condensation on the plastic, which perpetuates the problem of not being able to see.  I wanted to use this while taking walks around my neighborhood during the quarantine, but doesn't look like I'll be able to. It gets super hot while wearing the black hat, and hangs low...which also adds to the difficulty of seeing with the hat on. You can't really wear the hat further back so that it's easier to see bc the plastic will fall in your face more (which wouldn't be the case if the plastic were firm/smooth). You can see the ground, but it's not convenient to look straight to see where you're walking bc the rim of the hat gets in the way of your view."
2.0,"Looked very nice... for the five minutes I got to wear it before it completely fell apart. It didn't get caught on anything or pulled on... One minute I was wearing it and the next it was in pieces. You get what you pay for, I guess..."
2.0,"Very thin, material is not comfortable.  Just didn't expect them to be so basic for the price.  They feel like they would puncture easily, and have no grip for being in the wet."
2.0,Sizes are way too small. We ordered a large for my fiancee who normally wears a medium and the large fit like a small.
2.0,seams started coming apart after washing. otherwise it was a decently comfortable fit and the thickness was good.
2.0,"If you're looking for a generic starter hood, this can be a substitute that is cheap and affordable, however, I think you should venture away from Amazon and splurge for a MrS hood which you can customize to your head and exchange muzzles. This hood is a bit on the smaller side so if you are anything but small, id suggest you look elsewhere."
2.0,"My son loves the shoes, but one did not light up at all and the other makes this crackling sound instead of darth vader's breathing. Would have sent them back but it was not worth fighting/explaining to my 3 year old why he couldn't have his new shoes."
2.0,"Nice color and size, but the metal clasp on the bag broke after use."
2.0,It looks like 2 pieces in the picture but it is indeed one whole piece. Which is awkward with the slit in the middle and it's just not what I thought it was going to be and when I have it on I feel ridiculous. What is the slit in the middle for if you're also going to sew it to the bottom piece???? Its so weird but for no reason....
2.0,"Not that impressed, the material was as expected however the print had printing marks and wasn’t a clean white print. Unfortunately I didn’t have time to return as it was for my daughters birthday. She still liked it but personally I was disappointed."
2.0,"While they look nice, it's just deceiving. They were cheap and that's what I should have expected. I bought these to give one to my BF and one for me to keep. However, her ring broke within a month."
2.0,"While this set is indead beautiful, the greenish, grayish, bluish color it turnes my finger is not. When I contacted the seller, they said it was because I was having an alergic reaction to the mixed metals and to coat it with clear nail polish. To me its no better than a pretty cracker jacks prize."
2.0,Ordered an XL but it fit more like a small.  Would recommend going go up 2-3 sizes for a better fit.
2.0,"The moccasin was returned because it was too large.  Ordered a replacement in smaller size, but it was defective and was returned.  Because the replacement was not directly from Amazon, there was a fee for the return, even with Prime.  Disappointed in that."
2.0,Legging aren't full length.  I am 5'3&#34; and they barely hit my  shins.  Very disappointing
2.0,The chain on this is really big a gotty. It's also a short chain so it looks like a choker necklace.
2.0,This came way too small.
2.0,"The whole dress was great - except the neck line!  It's like someone stretched out the fabric to the max up there.. it's really weird.  I tried to take it to a tailor, because everything else fit really great, but she said it's just the way the dress was and there really wasn't much she could do to fix it.  Really disappointing and not like the images."
2.0,"This product came in a different colour than the one described in the picture, it was more pink rather than the red one I ordered. Almost a flashy pink colour and the material was really poor quality I honestly didn't expect it to be such bad quality, basically he colour I don't care at all but the quality was just baddd, not very stretchy at all and not even cotton very very thin fabric and just cheap, it looks very cheap in general :( I'm dissapointed because I ordered this product mostly because I thought it was better quality as well as for the color and it's just bad. Save your money, I do not recommend this product."
2.0,Everything fit EXCEPT THE SLEEVES. I had to cut the sleeves off because they were sewn so small. Other than that the outfit is adorable
2.0,I bought this product for my eight year old daughter. She loved the ring but it was way too small for her pinky even and my daughter is a very fit child. She was very dissappointed when she tried it on and it did not fit. Was more the size of a toddler ring but I would not condone giving this ring to a toddler.
2.0,Clasps on the earrings don't stay closed. Cheaply made. I've lost my dinosaur a few times.
2.0,The item has a rip in it under the sleeve
2.0,It's not a true cowl neck. The sweater fits up high on the neck causing a lot of bulk around the neck. It has zero shape and is not flattering. Okay for real cold weather.
2.0,Runs a size or two small
2.0,Pretty and great length but the clasp is always in the front. I have to fix it 50 times a day.
2.0,My son only wore his sneakers once. The second time we went to charge them one sneaker would not charge! Unfortunately the return window was one week over. This is unfortunate because he loved wearing the sneakers the one time he did.
2.0,"Love all the pockets and size of the purse, but the loop that holds the strap on the left side tore off. I purchased it on May 26 and haven’t overfilled it or put undue stress on the strap."
2.0,Fur lining made the boot fit too tight.
2.0,Didn't like the material and the neck made it look too much like just a very neck t-shirt for my liking. More than the pictures show.
2.0,"I ordered the ones shown in the thumbnail, but recieved stockings that just said ""&lt;3 Cat"" on them. They also came way too small. Would not recommend."
2.0,"Does not come in at the waist, I feel like I'm wearing a soft bag. Will fix myself. I guess size down because this fabric is too cute?"
2.0,I wouldn't bother buying this. Definitely not worth it. 2 of the 3 snowflakes were damaged. Looks better in photo
2.0,"I do not think that customers like this man Boots could anyway favor Patek Philippe; he may be converted to human race again, and then donate his watch for war victims and buy a cheap Asian watch to go around."
2.0,"Took forever to arrive. Bows fell off after first wear. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
2.0,Belt advertised is different than the belt sent.  Belt sent is not solid leather but rather has a pattern.
2.0,"It's costume jewelry the post is to long and the back is tiny,  and the metal is something cheap and irrataing to my ears 4mm size is good and setting looks ok."
2.0,"I liked the way it looked, and the pockets were sweet, it totally kept my clothes covered, but by the 2nd week of wearing it (I clean houses), I thought ""sweet, the bleach isn't effecting the color"", but than when I tied the side strings, one came detached - the strings are glued on - so they had to be stitched back on :(  than as I was going thru my work world, the pocket ripped down the seam, but on the positive side, at least it was the seam, so I can just stitch the pockets and stitch up all the seam work to reinforce it, and than it will be a wonderful apron for me to work in"
2.0,Bracelets were made for a mans wrist. They are slightly large for a woman.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:33f53d9475030175361607b0253744bb]] These fit like regular workout pants, nothing special about them. They dont have the compression of lulus or spanx, the only plus is that they have pockets. My main issue with these pants is that they do not stay up. If you wear satin underwear or a similar material the pants are constantly sliding down and even with regular underwear they slide, just not as much. The pants look good and who doesn't like another pair of plastic form-fitted pants to add to their arsenal but its annoying to have to constantly pull up on them every time you walk."
2.0,The material was of poor quality... More like night  wear ...
2.0,My daughter is 7. Very picky. Got big into bikinis this summer. I fully expected this to be tweny weeny. I was surprised she liked the top and not the bottom. Her whole butt was out practicly. She wore the top with different bottoms. She was comfortable in the top so i let her wear it at home in the pool. I def would not send her to a water park or pool party in it. Its sort of disturbing this cut is in a childs size. Wouldn't purchase again would not recomend
2.0,Not plus size friendly. Super disappointed nothing fit except the neck tie and necklace. I ended up having to buy a white dress shirt and walk around with the jacket folded over my arm.
2.0,Dry flimsy glasses and not true vision.<br />Worth the price and works for cheap glasses to just throw around outside for casual use.
2.0,Ordered XL because I have really big boobs and it fit my Daughter who is a size 2 and an A cup.
2.0,"Ordered a large and it fit as expected. I’m usually between a M to L, more on the M side for women’s. It’s just slightly loose throughout. The bottom hem’s stripes were even for me, but the collar’s stripes were very noticeably uneven. I’m not that picky and I’m not expecting the greatest quality but I would have rather the bottom hem be uneven (as someone mentioned) than the top so it’d be less obvious.<br />I would have kept it but the ruffle on one arm was noticeably smaller in length than the other arm for the front part of the short so it looked very uneven. Other than that it was decent quality, not paper thin, and a cute top.<br />I exchanged it and hoping for a better one. I’ll update my review when I receive it."
2.0,"Sad to give 2 stars, but I am disappointed for a couple reasons. First, I usually take off my necklaces when I shower, but I showered with this necklace on ONE TIME and the color completely changed immediately. It left blue/grey coloring on my neck due to the cheap quality. It is no longer rose gold but, a darker brown/copper color.... The pineapple pendant color is ruined as well... I guess it was cheaply made because the second reason I gave this bad rating for the product is that after only 2 days of wearing my necklace, it broke. So now it was not only a cheap product, but a waste of money ): I am going to try and see if I can get a refund..."
2.0,These are super cute shoes for the price but the problem is the heel is not solid. After two wears the heel is squashed down when walked on that it feels like I will roll my ankle with every step. I wanted to love these shoes but they are not well constructed and that was disappointing.
2.0,Weird fabric but looks okay on
2.0,"The clasps that attach to the watch are very good compared to other bands I've tired. Unfortunately the button closure pops open too easily and my watch has fallen off my wrist multiple times in a few days, despite wearing it loosely. I don't recommend it."
2.0,Esta sucio i descosido
2.0,Way too small and can see right through it.
2.0,"Very weird but it's got eyes on it. You can't see through so I don't know why. But this is pretty flimsy and won't last past a season, I bet. On a motorcycle, it's NOT warm."
2.0,My granddaughter was very disappointed
2.0,Didn't like the texture of the gabric. Looked nice though.
2.0,Size not correctly stated.
2.0,"This bra was pretty, but so flimsy there was NO SUPPORT and the shoulder straps just slid off and there was no way to adjust them so I couldn’t tighten them."
2.0,"I buy straps for glasses for my 9 month old son. Every inch counts. These say they're like 3.5 inches but the length of the buckles adds another inch, making these far too long and unusable for him. They also arrived frayed, which does not give me confidence on how long they'll last once he's actually big enough to use them."
2.0,It looks good.. but it's difficult to breathe through
2.0,The strap of the sandal didn't have enough stretch to reach around my ankle. The thread of the scandal wasn't threaded properly and started to unravel. Never got the chance to wear them.
2.0,"The shirt fits well, but the fabric is just odd. It almost smells like it's burning. I don't use a dryer, so that's not it. Even after 4 washes, it smells weird...like a chemical burning stink."
2.0,Very cute top but cut a bit small. Very scratchy fabric.
2.0,"I'm 5'4 and the kitty face is not on my knees,  it's on mid thighs. Also,  I've ordered navy blue and received black"
2.0,I ordered 2 of these hoodies 2 sizes bigger then my actual size just so that I can wear them baggy and yet they were both too small!!!! These hoodies run WAY too small...
2.0,"Awkward fit, perhaps it wasn’t cut right? Tight in some places and loose in others. Looked and felt like a poor fitting maternity shirt. Not worth the price."
2.0,It was too small for my neck! Had to use as a bracelet 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
2.0,The gold is not soft it's very disappointing fabric is soft though.
2.0,"Nice earrings, but broke during 1st time wear."
2.0,"I like the color and the bottoms, but the top is way too big of a cup unless you are C or larger"
2.0,"The only thing I had an issue with was the fact that it did not stop 'munching', only via the On/Off switch"
2.0,"The fit is tolerable if low waisted pants are good for you. If not, the conversations from Asian sizing should be avoided. Stitching on the cuffs started coming apart after one wearing. The pockets are so shallow I now understand the irritation women have with the pockets in their jeans.  As sleep pants, these are ok if it’s the only thing clean. I would NEVER wear these to work out in or out in public."
2.0,Very disappointed in the quality of this blouse. Fit was not as I expected and the overall appearance would not have been appropriate for the occasion that I ordered it for
2.0,They weren’t the actual size shown. To tight on the face. I gave them away.
2.0,The frame broke after wearing them about 5 times
2.0,Was not very impressed with product. Looked and felt inferior.
2.0,"It is hard to pull out the crown to adjust date and day. It is also date/day not move smooth when turn the crown counter clock. The band is not real leather as it said, bottom band make by plastic not leather, top of band unsure made by leather. Also the band is hard and difficult to wear on wrist. Do not really like it. Only 1 day do not know how good it moves"
2.0,"Though the quality is pretty good, the straps don't get as tight as I would like them to, which means my ukulele hangs lower than I want."
2.0,Slightly see through!
2.0,"Very comfortable. Fit was as expected. I did take thier advise and order up a size. Rating is because Out of the 3 one was damaged, the lace was seperated from the shirt due to it not fully sewn on."
2.0,It was to short and I’m not tall. So if your are taller then 5’4 I would buy this.
2.0,My son wears a 10.5-11 and I ordered an 11 and he couldn’t even get his foot in the boot. So disappointed. I had to send them back. The looked cute though
2.0,Nice watch but made for toddler wrists.
2.0,I thought this combination was way over priced. I could have gotten the sunglasses at a dollar store. I wasn't impressed
2.0,"They did get here quickly, but when they arrived half the posts were bent. They are a little heavier and bigger than what I am used to too."
2.0,"Great to look at, and watched worked, but buckle for custom wrist fitting broke when adjusting for size."
2.0,Very small for actual size.
2.0,The second hand is not working correctly. Flops around and gets stuck with the hour and minute hands.
2.0,These socks are VERY thin and very uncomfortable around the toes. They feel tight and make my toes feel very restricted. NOT a comfortable pair of socks.
2.0,"Thin cheap material, fits like a bag but it’s okay for the pool"
2.0,"The color was way off, I ordered it in gray. In the picture it appeared to be a medium gray with some black trim. When it arrived it was sealed in a bag containing a label that stated it was gray, but the bag was actually a dark purple.  Since this was ordered as a gift for a young man, I couldn't give him a purple toiletry bag.  Kept it for myself & sought another from somewhere else for the gift. Very disappointed in the color,  & have to wait and see if the bag holds up."
2.0,"I was sent a large despite ordering a small. Also, the rose gold is far from rose. It’s an orange bronze. Not the end of the world but heads up. Stays on well so far; I have been wearing it less than a day but it didn’t move in my sleep. We’ll see how it holds up."
2.0,not nearly as large as it is portrayed
2.0,I didn't want the return on a gift card I wanted it to apply to my balance $27.55
2.0,Fit was about what I expected.  Very low cut which is evident in the picture.  But it is also VERY see through in the back. Even white undergarments wouldn't work.  Needed a costume for work and this won't work.  The head piece was also really cheap looking.  I am returning.
2.0,"Larger than expected, clasp broke very easily and had use tools to reconnect it,  license pocket is not “fitted” so I have to tape my license in there so it doesn’t fall out and zipper part is super lose, just the weight of my keys will unzip the zipper so I am constantly worried about my money or cards falling out"
2.0,They look like the picture but material is silky 100% polyester not warm at all they are short aswell I’m 5 ‘10 and they are way above my ankle I’m very disappointed.
2.0,"Love the fit of these maternity leggings, much more comfortable than trying to swear pre-pregnancy workout pants.. However after just wearing and washing three times, the material began to tear.. Unfortunate because I really liked them.."
2.0,"I love this band and got many compliments. However, it is already broken."
2.0,The material is good but the cutting is bed. It pressed the breast done instead of  supported.
2.0,Very pretty but poor quality.. Arrived without one pf stones. Returning
2.0,"The slippers fit well, but after 14 months of wear the soles on both slippers completely gave out, separating from the slipper and cracking."
2.0,Definitely shorter than expected
2.0,"These riding pants are very comfortable and are a great value. I have ordered a second pair. Recommended.<br />Update: When I wore these pants I noticed something strange, the legs are DIFFERENT LENGTHS!!<br />I will be sending them back for exchange as I do like them. I must have got a pair that slipped by quality control! Will update review when I receive replacement."
2.0,"This shiz is small. I got an XL and it fits like a small. I'm not big either. I ordered an XL because I wanted it to be super draped and flowing. Nope. Not happening. It kind of flows. The quality is not great. i mean I know I couldn't expect a master piece considering the price, but the seams are wobbly, and it's cut funky. If it didn't cost more to send it back to China than it did to buy it - I'd send it back.<br />2 stars because it showed up way sooner than the ETA."
2.0,I’m 5’10”.  Way too short for my torso
2.0,My son loved the color of the shoes and was very disappointed at the fit.. I had to return them.and go with a different brand
2.0,Too heavy and is made for very small ears. Impossible to wear without discomfort. I could only wear the single butterfly for the right ear and after a few minutes I had to take it off.
2.0,I really wanted to love these capri pajama sets that I bought for myself and a set to gift.  They cling too much to the skin.  I had to return both sets.
2.0,"I was going over some disturbing PETA information. Taiwan is a country which has a rather nasty reputation when it comes to animal cruelty. This is a place where dogs are rounded up and skinned alive, I have seen a video a video of this taking place. One reviewer says how amazingly soft the leather is and how can it be from a cow? He might be wearing someone's pet!"
2.0,Disappointed in this supposedly oversize shirt! It was very uncomfortable and tight in the sleeves! I returned it!
2.0,Color is not accurate; much too red in color.
2.0,La camisa no concuerda con el size solicitado. Tuve que venderla mas adelante.
2.0,"Nice pice for the time it last, issue was the lock clip opens easily, with out you being aware."
2.0,"Nice, but much too wide. Unfortunately have to return."
2.0,"It will work as a quick slipper to put on and take the pups out to potty...but it is obviously cheaply made. Not comfortable at all for wearing for any length of time. I really don't care for the cheap lil narrow elastic ""thread"" of rope that is sewn into the ankle area. As you take off the slipper the inside slips out with your foot (kinda like a boot insert). I would not recommend spending your money on this slipper and continue to look around for a slipper that is of better quality and materials.  I will go back to shop for my slippers at Cabela's and spend the extra money on a slipper that is of better quality."
2.0,"The size is too high for de age, the measure is not appropriate"
2.0,These are not good to be used as safety goggles. They do not seal properly. Good for people with slim/small faces. These are also not fully anti-fog. Disappointed with this product
2.0,Cut dress way to small even after going up two sizes
2.0,I ended up giving it to my sister. she wears small
2.0,I followed the size guide and it was still to small. Also the sleeves are very tight and nothing about it feels retro
2.0,"Blue tooth beanie only lasts about an hour after a full charge, Hard to turn off and on. not a high rate"
2.0,"Yellow is hard to find. Although this is a really inexpensive ring, the design is very cool and I love the bright yellow, but Literally, the stone feel out upon my 2nd wearing of it and and so it's gone. Seller needs to secure it better. Now I have to reorder another as I doubt they will supply me another to insert. KB"
2.0,This dress ran a little large and the quality was poor. Thin cheap feeling material.
2.0,very uncomfortable & cheaply made.
2.0,"I was in love with these on initial use. I was ELATED to have my 36 in softloc extensions out the way. This is my second time having this style and while it is beautiful, it took me a year to do them again because sleeping and showering was a nightmare. But These bonnets saved the day.  I have a braiding shop, and these long locs are one of my most requested, so I was even recommending these bonnets to people. THEN, not even a week after the first day, the first bonnet I opened ripped down the back seam. At first I was like ok maybe it’s something that I did, maybe I accidentally snipped it when I opened the package. The rip was small and it was no big deal. Then it gradually got wider until it was big enough for locs to start hanging out. Still, No big deal as I still had two left. Opened another one. Same thing happed in the same place. Now I’m on my 3 bonnet in less than a month. Not to mention the band loosened up around the head so now it slides down during the night. I thought I was getting a deal turns out I was getting exactly what I paid for; A CHEAP MESS. The two stars are only Bc they did/do really help until they start disintegrating."
2.0,"The shorts fit funny in the front, and the top is small and short. It is super cute print tho"
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Size runs small. Order a size up to get the look like the picture
2.0,Crystal was nice. Attachment for necklace came loose after 2 days.
2.0,arrived with a chipped place. since not too noticeable decided to keep. looks great on my sweater and get compliments.
2.0,"Scratches very easily, when I opened the package it was already scratched"
2.0,"Beware if you are tall or have a long torso! Once I was finally able to contortion myself into getting my shoulder in, the bra insert placements were literally about halfway below my breasts! I tried re-positioning them but the make of the swimsuit would not allow much adjusting in that area. Sad to say, I am returning this suit."
2.0,"I ordered a medium and it looked like a child's top, not even a women's size small"
2.0,Bought it out of curiousity. It does hold your pants up. Will take a while to see if the leather lasts. As a follow up on Feb 16 after four months the leather is wearing out where it fits in the ratchet. Guess it's the cheap leather that's the problem.  Probably my last click belt.
2.0,"Very uncomfortable to wear, cheaply made and you can tell. I threw it away. Don't recommend buying."
2.0,They are much smaller and thinner than the photo leads you to believe. They work great for around the house or under dresses
2.0,"Very pretty but the magnet on the clasp is so weak, the bracelet fell off just from a hand gesture. I kept having to reseat the clasp throughout the day and it still fell off about four times.  Plus, the decorations are pressed into a sticky flexible band, and any exposed band space gathers lint/fuzz/hair throughout the day."
2.0,bought 3 styles these necklaces are lovely wore each one ---only one time and fell apart..unless you are a jewerly maker who has tools put back together i would not waste my money
2.0,"Way too small, even at XXL"
2.0,"These shirts are very thin, you can see right through the white one. They are also VERY small. The Youth XL fit more like a youth M/L"
2.0,The hood was not properly sewn onto the base of the sweater.
2.0,"Weird material.  Short. Odd fit. Definitely don’t get it wet!  Does not Absorb water or dry quickly, Should you put it over a wet bathing suit."
2.0,"Everything except the horseshoe was too small to even get into my septum piercing. They were pretty, but non-functioning."
2.0,Good size and super cute. Hard to clasp once you get it in and it bends easy. Not sure I will get to wear it even one time because of it bending while trying to get it to clasp.
2.0,"Quality is in line with the price (not amazing, but I didn’t expect amazing for the price).  Very small though.  I ordered a medium (my regular size) based on previous reviews, and took it out of the bag and immediately knew there was no way it would fit :/"
2.0,"Fabric is some type of double knit polyester, not attractive"
2.0,Item was not pure white
2.0,nice looking but extremely flimsy. Bought two and they both broke within the first few wears.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:ee8fa6baa712bebb6a76d7754bb47f6d]] Editing my review to say I looked back at the product after looking at the dress some more and they are nothing alike! There are clearly some really harsh creases in the belt and breasts and the material is completely different from what the pictures look like. It’a a fine dress if this is what you’re looking for but I will be returning it.<br /><br />I really like the dress and it’s good quality for the price. The slit is poorly constructed (each side of fabric crosses over to the front of the opposite leg so the slit ends up being non existent unless I pull back a layer- I’ll probably try to safety pin the bottom layer back a bit to fix it. Overall I’m happy with it. For reference I am 5’6” about 160-165 34C and I bought a 10. Im also wearing 3” heels in this photo.
2.0,"IT'S A SO SO SWEATER, THE SLEEVES ARE TOO SHORT"
2.0,"Definitely only for kids.  I like to give away at parades, and am almost embarrassed to give these.  Easy to break.  Colors questionable (is that orange or red?  purple or pink?)"
2.0,a little thin and runs small
2.0,"It looked pretty, but was difficult for me to put on and take off.  I finally have it away."
2.0,"Fit fine, but the rim was so bent out of shape when I got it, the wire rim wouldn't bend back right"
2.0,The item I received was not as pictured. I didn't take a picture before I shipped it back. It had a weird smell as others noticed as well. I would have kept it if it looked as shown in the picture.
2.0,very flimsy...will probably only get 1 use from it.
2.0,"A really plush slipper....But....the top shearling is dyed almost orange.  Luckily, my husband did not want to bother to send them back.  But I was disappointed."
2.0,It was way too big. It slid around my wrist making me have to enter the passcode repeatedly.<br />It looks good.<br />Anyone know where can I get one for a 5.5” wrist?
2.0,As far as fit goes: the fit is spot on. I'm 5'7 127 lbs and a 32C. I ordered a small!<br />The bottoms on this are so incredibly awkward. And the material is much shinier than in the photo. The quality of this is really great though just like other Cupshe suits. My only complaint are the bottoms so I will be returning.
2.0,"We bought the mermaid rainbow swim suit in the 4-5. Fits my 5 year old weird, it was too wide for her. She is tall for her age, and pretty average build."
2.0,"Nice hat, but.... WOW!  This thing is freakishly huge.  I measured approx. 26&#34; circumference with velcro tab on back at default setting!<br />I like the denim and look, but had to return because my XL (7-3/4) head just ain't big enough!"
2.0,Disappointed with size and quality. Pattern on dress was cute but quality poor.
2.0,Bought this for vacation. There’s no support for your breasts if you’re blessed like me. I wear a 38DDD. Love the cover up but cannot wear the swimsuit.
2.0,Really thin.  Smells like chemicals.  It’s ok but I wouldn’t buy it had I seen it in person.
2.0,"So sad about this sweater. It's really cute and was just what I was looking for.  I'm 5'7"", 125lbs and not curvy at all.  Long arms and legs and I got a medium.  The sleeves are super long but it's just fine.<br /><br />The reason why I'm only giving this 2 stars is because I don't know what the heck the material this sweater is made from, it's so fricking itchy.  It even itches where it is resting on my wrists/hands and on the back of my neck.<br /> There's no way on God's green earth I'd be able to wear it without a thick long sleeve shirt underneath.<br /><br />Not sure if I should return it or attempt to wash it and see how it feels.  I'll update if I decide to keep and wash."
2.0,"Bought a dress for each daughter- ages10 & 4. Bought a size 10 and a size 6. Both sizes were entirely too big in the chest, straps and underarm. Bought an 8 and a 4. The length was much shorter and still were too big in the straps and chest. Returning all 4. The dresses are pretty so it's unfortunate that the sizing is so terrible."
2.0,I have been looking everywhere for a camel colored jacket. This looks great on the model but in person it is cheap polyester and blazer that looks like it is missing the suit pants.
2.0,I was very disappointed bc one of the pockets had started coming undone so there was a huge hole in it. Needed the shorts asap for my  husband that was out of town<br />so I couldn't return them! For a replacement..
2.0,Ordered the blue geometric print in medium and large and received the tropical print for both. Really would like to order and receive the blue geometric
2.0,I returned it. It was so small.
2.0,"okay and i was generally looking for a cheap backpack, but a few problems bother me.  the pockets on the hip belt are a great feature, but mine appear to be sown on upside down with the large pocket part above the zipper and only a tiny bit below so i have to hold stuff in while i zip it.  the large internal compartment is expandable, but the top section that clips over it does not adjust, so you can't actually fill the inside.  i was pretty close to full and the buckles holding the top compartment on were at there max.  when you fill up the inside compartment, the outer 3 pockets are nearly useless.  i haven't ripped it yet, but the material feels pretty thin.<br />on the plus side, it s comfortable, lightweight, large, and cheap.  i don't regret purchasing it for $50, but if you have a larger budget you may want to get a nicer bag."
2.0,"The color and fabric were very pretty, but the dress didn’t look anything like the picture. In the picture it looks like the bodice has seams that open into a loose flowing skirt. In fact the seams run all the way to the hem and the dress fit like a mermaid costume, not a bit if flare to the skirt. For  the record, I am 5’6”,weight 150. I ordered large, which should have been more than ample. Needless to say, I returned it."
2.0,"Pretty disappointed with the quality of these shirts, after the first wash (didn’t dry them) the stitching is coming out of the zipper and the seams."
2.0,"Works great. For two months. I bought two of them, same story. It quit connecting with anything Bluetooth. Decently comfortable hat."
2.0,"These are cute and look just like Gentle Monster’s sunglasses but so cheap!  I had high hopes since it says “ High Quality Acetate”, I don’t think so…. It will break easily, returning them. I probably wouldn’t pay more than $5-$8… I paid almost $20!  Don’t waste your money…"
2.0,Purchase  for my hubby  but it looks better in the  photo. The  .material is not what I expected
2.0,"Used as support bra following surgery and although I bought another one of the exact same kind...this one the zipper was poor, bad...and has continued to hang up...didn't want to hassle returning it as I needed to have two to use interchangably. ALL zippers not created equal."
2.0,"They look nice, but personally I don't like the glare/reflection. Feels like I'm looking in a mirror, which doesn't help my eye strain."
2.0,Would not stay up
2.0,"I feel like the product picture is really inaccurate here. The color is a bit more faded than it looks in the picture, which is disappointing. The one we got was faded enough to be a bit off-putting. The fit is a touch smaller in length and larger in the waist than would be preferable to me. The skirt doesn't seem nearly as long compared to the torso on the one we got as it is in the image.<br /><br />It's not bad, but it isn't what we were expecting and the difference is enough to make it less desirable. Hence the rating."
2.0,nice look but broke after first wear
2.0,Hard review : shape /look : 100% / lentes : little fog all the time .
2.0,These are really really SMALL and don't come with any way to attach to a bracelet. I bought them as a gift and was very disappointed.
2.0,it looks great but can not clasp. not worth the effort
2.0,"Loved the fabric, nice and stretchy. Fit my petite 5 year old girl well. However, the left arm hole hem unravel in the first wash."
2.0,The necklace looks beautiful I love the earrings too....only problem was that the clasp doesn't open on the necklace. I own jewelry repair tools so I can fix it but others may not be able to
2.0,The shirts were great until I noticed the red stain on the white shirt.
2.0,"I wanted to really like this band! The design is unique and artistic, but the quality of the band is poor. After wearing it for two days the edges started to noticeably fray."
2.0,I wear a small and these fit my 7yr old 🙄🤣🤣 order way up in size lol
2.0,"Not as pretty as the picture. Runs a size smaller than my normal size. Hugs EVERTHING so if you have tummy, thighs or a behind that you'd rather hide, this is not the dress for you. HINT: Also, picks up animal hair like a magnet! Need to clean now and drop 20 pounds to even consider wearing. Regret the purchase. Avid Amazon shopper ... but this one was a bust."
2.0,It has turned my ear green and my peircing is still kinda sore from getting it peirced in January. Don't know if that's from the earring but kinda disappointed. It sucks to sleep on but don't know if that too is from my ear not being healed all the way.
2.0,Fits true to size or even i a little bigger! Every comfortable!
2.0,Product stretches out and doesn’t stay form fitting. Colors don’t all fit the same.
2.0,"I disliked the fact that the chain was pictured being a perfect fit-attachment to the croc; however, it is not. The chain does not properly fit and looks unappealing. I am disappointed."
2.0,"The bands do not have the Quickfit clips like the original band does. Other 3rd party options for similar pricing, have this.<br /><br />The original rods will have to be removed, breaking the seal of the loc-tite dries seal that seals the watch band screw fasteners from backing out."
2.0,did not fit product description.. Had a pocket flap where one sits.
2.0,These frames are really round !  I look like John Lennon
2.0,"Too big, should be adjustable."
2.0,"The quality of the overall glasses is top notch but I absolutely don't like the actual lenses. 1. The lenses are not dark enough, 2. The lenses transition from the darkest part being at the top to a lighter shade towards the bottom.I like the glasses but if only the lenses were darker and a solid shade instead of transitioning to a lighter shade."
2.0,"I do not like these plants at all. Even if they aren’t flattering I post pictures now I get here on amazon, but I can’t do that here. That’s bad. I’m 5’6 and these are cropped length on me, like old school floods. They’re snug through the thighs but big everywhere else. Cellulite shows through the fabric. The color itself doesn’t look like it does on screen. It looks more faded. I wouldn’t recommend these. Per the Size chart I ordered a medium and they just have a weird fit. I won’t be wearing them. I’ll find a friend to give them away to. For reference I’m 28 waist and 34 hips."
2.0,bought 2 of these and replaced my laces in a pair of my shoes. The first thing I immediately noticed was the pressure the rubber ties placed on the top of my foot. Can't wear my shoes because it hurts my feet. Gave away the other ties.
2.0,The Stone was clear not greenish when I went to return it I noticed there was a couple of stones missing so I ended up keeping it I do not recommend
2.0,Lace fell apart in the wash
2.0,"I purchased this nightgown for post op surgery. When it arrived, I immediately noticed that the pockets are so shallow they were useless. I need it to be able to hold my cell phone while I walk around the house, and my cell phone immediately fell to the ground because the pockets are so shallow. If you are looking for a good lounge around the house Nightgown that will hold your cell phone. This is not your housedress. I do not recommend this product. I returned it."
2.0,"This is soooo cute, flowy, and flattering. I’m a size 18 and I got a 2x and it fits really well, just grazes the body which I like. Was honestly shocked at how flattering this is!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wish I could return it! I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry and it shrunk by an entire size. It still fits but it’s no longer flowy which is why I loved it. The fabric is horrible if it can’t handle a cold wash and a hang dry!! UGH. From 5 stars to 2!"
2.0,"I recently purchased three swimsuits from golovey and the items I received in the mail today were not as expected. Color D2 shows a bright pink/purple bottom which looks darker in person. The top shows a mint, coral, and black mesh top. The item received has absolutely no mesh on it and the colors are off. Color #A matches the item in the image closer than item D2 but the closure is cheaper and the straps have silver accent pieces and not black. There is also more space between the cup and the black strap below it. The last item purchased and the one I was mostly disappointed in was color #C. The image shows that it is made of a shiny bronze material. The item I received was not shiny at all. Instead it is a flat brown. please be aware that the items in the pictures are not what you will be getting. The stitching on every piece was done with half the effort which is hard to see in the photos. The only positive thing I can say about this order was that it came in sooner than I thought it would. It was originally scheduled to be delivered in march."
2.0,Recieved this stunning necklace for my daughter in laws Mothers day present. It was beautiful. Unfortunately it has turned to a tarnished look. I just learned of this and will be contacting the seller. Hopefully something can be done.
2.0,"The hearts were two different gauge sizes, so one of them ended up being too small for my ear. It’s a shame cause these plugs are pretty cute"
2.0,FELL apart easier than expected.
2.0,"They call it a “knitted hat”, but it is not, im not sure if there was a mix up and i got the wrong thing, but mine was made out of this thin white fabric, different from the pictures. However, if you like that type of hat, go for it. The price is great, it didn’t rip or anything, and the spongebob reference is awesome. Just not what i was expecting."
2.0,"This shirt arrived within the estimated delivery date. While the pattern is similar to what is pictured,  it is definitely not the same shirt. It is more of a  spandex instead of cotton, so it's clingy/stretchy instead of loose and comfy like the picture and description claim. I'm pretty disappointed in the material and fit,  but only bc I was expecting something so different.  Otherwise it is ok."
2.0,It is shorter than the picture
2.0,The body chains changed colors.
2.0,This item was received damaged.  It had several holes in it which appeared to be from moths. It would have been perfect otherwise.  I would be leery of ordering from this company in view of this.
2.0,I was disappointed in this top.  It was not as supportive as I would have liked and pooched out on the sides past where the wire was.
2.0,"Overall a decent bag, but not what is pictured. The item did not have the HRC logo on the front. It also did not have the &#34;Ride Red&#34; writing on the side. It did not have the sponsors on the side either. It simply had the Honda wing logo and Troy Lee logo on the side. The Troy Lee Designs signature on the front was not in the red part of the front of the bag, it is below it and the very bottom part of it was cut off. The Troy Lee Designs signature also has the bottom of it cut off on the side panel as well. I just don't appreciate the misrepresentation of the item by the pictures listed."
2.0,Beautiful bikini but unfortunately the lack of size options (you need to go up at least 2 sizes from what you normally wear) leaves very little to the imagination.<br />I will be keeping it though since it's too cute to send back.<br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review
2.0,"This dress is definitely rayon or some other synthetic, not cotton as listed. With this kind of material it clings to every lump and bump. It seems you can't trust the descriptions on Amazon. I'll only be buying brands I've heard of."
2.0,"materiel is very cheap feeling, looks kind of trashy once you put it on and very delicate"
2.0,Runs small and has an awkward fit. I will be returning it. It’s a shame because the dress is adorable and the fabric is not flimsy....love the fabric.
2.0,Cute dress but not flattering for size 10-12 ladies with big busts.
2.0,Ordered a pair for my husband and I. Not really helpful.
2.0,"These bands are NOT 26&#34; in length. They measure at or just under 25&#34;,"
2.0,"This dress is a great length, but the fit is not flattering and made me feel like I looked wider then I am."
2.0,These just looked cheap when I got them.  Returned.
2.0,"The nylon/spandex material itself seemed okay.  However the seam stitching did not hold up.  After warm-ups at my son's first swim meet of the season, the crotch stitching popped open, leaving a 2-inch hole on one leg and 1-inch hole on the other leg.  He had swam in these for about 7 practices.  We had to run over to a vendor tent to buy new jammers so he could compete.  Not worth saving $10-12."
2.0,Cheaply made. Cute for the price but don't expect it to last long.
2.0,"Very disappointed in this cheaply made and poorly designed head gear,"
2.0,"It was supposed to be a gift, and we ordered according to the measurements given.  When it arrived, it not only did not fit my tall, long-fingered friend, it was too small for me, who would have worn a medium.  Plus they are very short."
2.0,"The Red was more of a dark Pink.  They are small and the sewing is not the greatest, will not be buying them again."
2.0,"Look nothing like the photo. They are a very cheap crane machine looking knock off. Colors are wrong, fur is in the wrong places. Lopsided faces, poor quality fabric and stitching. However, they are in fact lion slippers, and they were given as a gag gift that made the receiver laugh. She says they are comfortable as well. All in all would not buy again, but I’m glad that they do the trick."
2.0,"The &#34;lunch box&#34; part is a tiny little bag. Bought to have a matching set, but didn't need two tiny purses."
2.0,Not impressed. Buckle was crooked on belt. Not acceptable especially at this price. Returned it.
2.0,"Way too small, the Large was like a small Medium.  Color is a pretty maroon, but the fabric was kinda itchy, not soft, felt super cheap.  Returned"
2.0,Ordered a Medium but it fit like a large.
2.0,"I really liked the shirt except it was to small.  I ordered 2xl because that was the biggest available. I’m not fat, I’m fit and this shirt did not fit. It fit like an XL. Some reviews say this shirt isn’t a real alpine star shirt. I will have to disagree."
2.0,"I needed to return it. If you want to use this swimsuit to swim laps, I would go with my size instead of listening to reviews on Amazon to get larger sizes."
2.0,"I just opened the package and was supperrrr disappointed with the fabric. It looks incredibly cheap and like a weird nightgown or robe thing... Does NOT look like the photo.... But, I am going to try it on and give different review.... but I was very sad with what showed up."
2.0,"I really loved the concept of this dress – the color and the style. It is a faux suede, nero collared dress with a large zipper down the front. The fabric is soft and comfortable. It is also stretchy, which should mean that it was forgiving, but unfortunately it isn’t. I’m curvy which isn’t a good thing to be if you want to wear this dress. It was definitely too tight and too small. I even had trouble zipping it over my 40DD chest so I will be returning this dress. However, if you can get the sizing right, I’d recommend it."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap...
2.0,"The style seems very cute but the fit is just... off. I purchased the 2x and usually I wear a 14/16, but I also wear 38F so usually I size up in bathing suits for the chest area. The bottom half fit well if not a bit tight and the top half was just falling off, which is a problem I do not have often. The fit did not make any sense and was not flattering AT ALL. The good part about it is the bottom half which was a very cute tie and I wish I could just make the top work. The straps are too thick around where you need to tie it so it turns out lumpy and there was still gapping around the rib cage area. All in all, just not a suit for me, but it was close."
2.0,"After wearing these tops a few times, I am editing my review.  Both of them are pilling like crazy.<br />They look terrible.<br /><br />I bought two of these tops.  I'<br />m 5'7"", 147 lbs.  The large fit me but I liked the way the xl fit better.  These are soft and comfortable.  The crossover front is very flattering.  I'm not a sweater girl.  These will be great for fall and winter.  For me, they are too warm for exercise."
2.0,"Other reviews were raving about how soft this jacket is, but they must be referring to another item. There is nothing impressive about this jacket. The inside lining is like an ok tshirt quality fabric and the outside is simply not soft. It seems cheap.<br /><br />Medium fit snugly over a thin tshirt for me (5ft 7, 153lbs)."
2.0,"I fell in love with the print and colors of this dress.....the print is the same but it looks like the faded sister of the one in the picture. I had planned to wear this to a wedding but because of the length and muted colors, it’ll be a dress I wear around the house."
2.0,Pretty but it “turned” at third wear. It became green and black.
2.0,"A bit weird top, one side is loser and the other one is normal, had to return it because of it. Other than that, cute dress with light material"
2.0,I loved this cardigan until I washed it. It has gone all bobbly and looks terrible after only one season.  So disappointed.  It's off to Goodwill.
2.0,"As other reviewers have said, this dress is extremely oddly made. The first dress I ordered was huge, especially in the bust, so I returned it and bought it in a smaller size. The second dress I got was dirty in some spots, the inner package was damaged (not the outermost package, though), and the bust was still waaaay too big. The padding is unnecessary as well. I'm going to just get it tailored, as I don't want to go though the hassle of sending it back yet again."
2.0,"This is very cute but not the best quality. My baby loves taking off her shoes (most babies do) and the velcro started coming off from this one almost immediately. Only after a couple months of wearing it, she can no longer use it because it no longer holds - the velcro has worn off. Also, the general quality seems to be poor."
2.0,"Loved the fabric, and I think if I had ordered up a size, I would be happy with my choice. Unfortunately, it was way too short and not “oversized” in the least. If you decide to take your chances, I suggest going up a size."
2.0,The quality is not there.
2.0,"Ordered size according to measurements guide provided, but item received too small. Still in closet. Unable to return."
2.0,Not as stretchy as I expected. Quite small. Disappointing.
2.0,For anyone who may be sensitive this will make itchy!
2.0,Literally looks like something my 65 year old mother would buy at Kohls and wear to bed. Cheap material is uncomfortable and doesn't fall nicely on the body so it ends up looking baggy and boxy.
2.0,These are so full they look like a balloon when you put them on.  This was my first time buying clothes and I won’t be doing it again.
2.0,Very cute but way to big
2.0,"I bought these via a deal of the day.  The price was excellent, however when I received them I thought they were rather short and fairly thin.  I have several leg warmers, and as leg warmers are not as readily available as they once were a few years ago I thought it was worth the risk to buy these.  I am 5'8&#34;, so my legs may be longer than some peoples', but for me these were not what I'd call &#34;knee high&#34; and after I washed them they were much shorter.  Mine are basically ankle warmers now, but in winter they will still serve a purpose.  However, I will not order more of these."
2.0,Cute top but run very small
2.0,"This shirt is made out of starchy hard material, NOTHING like a sweatshirt! It looks like a neon orange hunting shirt."
2.0,Ok but way too big for me.
2.0,Very thin. Feels plastic more than a material. It was cheap so I’ll give it a try and see how long it lasts.
2.0,STILL TO TIGHT
2.0,If I’d known these were being shipped from China I’d never had ordered them.  I can’t return them because the cost is prohibitive.  I guess I’m out $8.
2.0,Algo grandes
2.0,"Not thrilled with this belt. I had such high hopes for this being a sparkly accessory piece to my wardrobe. When I recieved it, I immediately noticed how thin and flimsy the material is. It is not lined, or reinforced, and is only slightly more durable than elasticized lace. I wish I had ordered a size larger,  because ANY amount of stretching on this belt causes it to lose it's integrity and it bunches up at the waistline. When I took it off, the crinkles stayed! It also appears cheap and sheer. Only way to pull this off is to make sure it fits as loose as possible with zero stretch. Defeats the purpose of a belt though, in my opinion. I have other belts like this, with quality elastic and sturdy integrity. Just know this is not one of those belts."
2.0,Turned color within 2 weeks.
2.0,Go one to two sizes bigger
2.0,So small you almost can't see it.
2.0,"These leggings are crazy comfortable. The moment I put them on I felt like I was wrapping up in butter. However, much to my disappointment my leggings ended up with a hole in the rear, right in the middle of the left cheek. There hadn’t been a hole before and somehow formed throughout the course of the day. Super disappointing, I’m torn between just returning them or replacing them."
2.0,The bracelet turned my skin green after only 6 hours of wear.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is very cute.
2.0,"The glasses in the photo are size 52mm, but what they ship you is 56mm which is much bigger. They are pretty cheap feeling for Tom Ford, but the style is what I expected."
2.0,It might fit a child. But the material is really cute and well made product.
2.0,"i paid extra money to have the spring arms so they would last longer from taking them on and off a lot, and that's exactly where they all broke within a couple of months"
2.0,Definitely not as thick and you can tell the quality is lower than other ponchos but it works fine for getting my son out of the pool or beach with less hassle and ease for changing.
2.0,"Love the concept of this band, which is why I gave it two stars. However, mine broke after about a week of wearing. I think the band needs more stretch to hold up. Mine was not too tight, in fact it was too big on my wrist, but taking it on and off over your hand is too hard on the band and it breaks."
2.0,Super silly but I was willing to look silly as long as it helped prevent sun damage. Might work well for walking but not jogging. Even after tightening it slips. More importantly I feel like it did ver little to protect me from the sun.
2.0,Small cheap not heavy duty
2.0,Color of solid part of shirt was not as dark as shown in the picture.  It was more of a heather gray not dark gray/black.  I dont like it as much but might keep it.
2.0,Not for my big face. It made me look so silly with bug eyes almost. Quality was decent. Returned.
2.0,The coating comes off the lenses
2.0,When I put them on I was really happy to see they had an elastic waist on them I bought the 4XL as I wear a 35/36 pants but these were big in the waist not a problem.<br /><br />I'm left handed so I carry my wallet in my left rear pocket well this does not have a left rear pocket and the right rear pocket was so small I could not fit my hand inside of it so had to carry everything in the front pockets.<br /><br />On the thighs it's a little looser then skinny jeans if your a person that has tree trunk legs then you will not enjoy these pants when I sat down felt like the material was going to tear! Returning them will try another!
2.0,"This necklace does have a felt backing like many have said and it's a little narrow for my neck. I don't even think I have a &#34;thick&#34; neck.... it flips up on the sides. Disappointed but the necklace is cute, just not functional for me. Maybe I'll give to my preteen niece."
2.0,"Way too large- then once washed, shrinks to 1/4 of the size. Also came with holes. Wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,I ordered the pink and received the burgundy very upset..
2.0,They barely fit over my eyes and not that comfortable.
2.0,Ill fitting and not very warm.  There is a strong odor that I cannot get rid of even with attempts to air out for a long time.  I have returned.
2.0,"If you are looking for a decently made washable mask, then these are nice.  However, I bought them for workouts and playing sports.  These are NOT suited for that and not breathable as described."
2.0,"Quick delivery, but arrived with dead batteries."
2.0,I waited a couple of weeks and when I recieved it was very nice until I put it on and the ink was coming off.  First bad purchase experience not a good one for me.
2.0,"The fabric is nice, the color is nice. This bra offers no support of any kind. It just sits on top of you. A t-shirt does as much."
2.0,These could not even last as inside only shoes for my kid for school. Very flimsy
2.0,And too long for me.
2.0,Lining ripped first wear.
2.0,Sequins fall off easily and there is no built in bra.  I was not happy with this dress and returned it.
2.0,Broke them the first week...
2.0,Was expecting a boot cut fit. It's more of a flare.
2.0,somewhat small but okay<br />was shorter than i expected<br />zipper didn't work
2.0,Zipper broke. Too small.
2.0,"They are not made for nose ring, gave to my friend for her eyebrow"
2.0,The shoes look so cute but they’re about two sizes too big. I ordered a six and I look about an eight.
2.0,My daughter LOVES this dress.  I gave it a 2 star rating because the seams on both sides if the top came apart after one wash on gentle cycle  :(
2.0,"I luv MK, but this bag was too big!"
2.0,"Not really silver. Good case, but not happy w the color"
2.0,Way too tight in the waist area
2.0,"Love the color, but this is a cheaply made purse.  The zipper for the larger and small purse are not stitched all the way to the end of purse so it looks awkward, and the material is shown in a few area of the zipper, where it should have been cut off of sewn into the zipper."
2.0,"they were listed as to also fit youth junior, they are a bit large.. didn't fit my teen and leaked"
2.0,"Ordered this product Nov 5th, has been worn twice and a hole has already developed by Nov 30th. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,This does not look like the picture in the advertisement. Especially the earrings look nothing like the picture. Its so cheap.
2.0,"I thought it was full of glitter and sequins, based on the name and the picture. It isn’t, it’s just a pattern on material so I was very disappointed."
2.0,These were cute and comfortable but I couldn’t keep them on my head. I have baby fine hair and within a few minutes of wearing them over my hair starting around my face they always slid off the back to meet my ponytail. Stayed on for a little longer with my hair down—but not worth the aggravation. Need little silicone gripper dots maybe?
2.0,"I am only giving 2 stars because the seller failed to mention that these come in Mens's sizes , the size chart list women's sizes. Seems as if I might be the third person to encounter this problem. Cute shoe though..just way too big."
2.0,"More like low-impact, and it feels thin and cheap. I have a larger chest and this gave me about as much support as I'd need to clean the house. I returned it promptly."
2.0,Looks nice and I really was happy with the purchase until the chrome plating began to fail after one month.  It was causing a skin rash and I had to switch back the black rubber band that the Fitbit Alta comes with.
2.0,"Leather quality was okay but the keys holder themselves didn't last very long, and all fell out after a few months of use."
2.0,"Fit and size are perfect! Unfortunately in a couple beach days the elastic wore out a bit around the waist. It is still wearable as the drawstring works, but it just fits a little different."
2.0,My wrist from bracelet it is large cant fit. I put on my ankle that fit better
2.0,Didn't receive what I wanted but oh well at least I still liked what I got
2.0,"It buckle broke away from belt after 6 months of use, have to by another one."
2.0,I bought these for my 5 year old niece and they didn't even make it over head.  Way too small and tight
2.0,went up a size still to small dont know if there is a bigger size then I order
2.0,These were lovely but they broke after only two months.
2.0,"I gave this dress a 2 only because the colors are beautiful..  And the delivery was fast!!  Now to what I found disturbing is its listed as very long  or extra long, I guess if your under 5""6 and your bust size are in the A's...  I order this dress due too once again the listing talks about the length  I'm 6""2 40DDD the top part didnt come no near my bust let alone wide enough to come across it, it  Definitely runs extra small I order extra large and I would assume its was a small or medium,  the length isn't long at all my daughter is 5""10 and it barely touched the top of her ankle!  So that would tell you how it fit me...  when pulling the top part up the elastic part came under the bust ,Lol!<br /><br />Disappointed to say the least!  Retuned for a refund"
2.0,Was not as expected.  The fit was not good.
2.0,"We returned these - they were too wide and just plain ugly. In my opinion, it is better to spend a bit more and get something better-looking, and, as it turns out, more supportive."
2.0,"The picture made the item look so sexy.. but when I wore it, I look like a granny? :/ Could be me or the underwears…. Sort of disappointed."
2.0,This item broke right at the watch face today. No warranty now. I do not recommend the product because it did not last 2 months. I thought it was a decent watch band but broke way to soon. Now I cannot use my watch and I am on a trip.
2.0,They were too big and thick
2.0,Good for long time use. Waist for hospice patient
2.0,"This may be a nice dress, I wear a large and bought a large, but it just felt too clingy.  Fabric is thin and doesn't lay well.  I loved the sleeves, which is why I ordered it.  Definitely for a small figure."
2.0,"Even when I order way up, I'm still disappointed. Somehow it's loose everywhere but at the bottom? And very see through. The detail around the sleeves looks poorly made and more for a tween than a grown woman trying to search for more work tops. Then again, I paid $5."
2.0,"Nice and soft, but there is much lower percentage of cotton than stated (((, I think about 20–30 maybe less ..."
2.0,Very thin. I guess I didnt realize they were pj. Gift for an unknown little girl at christmad
2.0,"I received this jacket and the material is very thin. Also, from reading the reviews, I decided to order a 3XL and the Jacket is still a little snug fitting under the arms funny considering I am 5'6 and wear a size 8/medium."
2.0,"After a day of walking, each of the socks had holes in them or were worn thin to the point where one could see through them."
2.0,"it arrived smelling of mildew and yellow-ish in color as if it had gotten wet and never fully dryed. It was so bad I couldn’t even try on the dress due to the smell. I had a white party to attend in the next 2 days, so I washed the dress, then tried it on only to realize it was a little too big. I really liked the dress, it was as pictured and true to size."
2.0,"The socks feel like they are quality during unboxing but putting on the first pair one of the socks ripped right away and they don’t match in length when on. In the package, yes, but actually on, the elastic on the one that ripped feels less stretchy. Hoping the other 4 pair are a bit better."
2.0,I wear size medium and a 34 inch bra and this wouldn’t even cover my whole back without trying to zip it up. Very cute dress but it’s at least two sizes too small for me
2.0,It's smaller<br />Then what I had expected
2.0,"Cute shirt, looks good...why I only have it 2 stars is because the sewing really sucks. It ripped as I was putting it on. And also, it’s a little bit short, wish it was longer. But It’s cute."
2.0,Don’t waste your money.  Buy the Skechers by BOB which I had to purchase after this terrible purchase.<br />They are NOT comfortable and made so cheaply that I know they will wear out in at least a month.
2.0,"Color is cool, fit is off. The right side sits lower than the left, which produces a crooked look. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"This product came, and they gave me 2 of the things which was pretty cool. But the metal is terrible. You get what you paid for!"
2.0,"I bought it before I read the reviews, and I wish I hadn't. The fabric part meant to hold your girls, might not even be enough for a C cup. I figured the fabric would at least be big enough for a D, as most XL tops tend to range between a C-D, so as a DD, I figured a little small wouldn't hurt too much. It was like fitting two watermelons into a napkin. The sizing is based more off of how big around you are, and not cup size. I'm only giving it two stars because it's still cute and made well, it's just not made for anyone bigger than a C cup."
2.0,"Cheaply made, very pretty but torn apart right before I left home. I was actually happy because this incident could've happened in the public. They are in the trash, waste of time and money."
2.0,"I’m so tired of receiving clothing from Amazon that is different than the picture. I wanted to like this but it’s not what I expected. The straps were very thick & wide & both front & back V’s were cut higher than shown. The fabric was much heavier & thicker than it looks & the length barely came to my ankles. All around awkward. If you’re after lots of coverage, give this a go. I wanted something a bit more beachy."
2.0,Smaller than size
2.0,"I had been hoping for a quick-dry top for indoor exercise, and this isn't it. It just doesn't wick away the sweat like some base-layer tops I have. It also feels clammy and sticky afterwards.<br /><br />So I'm back to simply soaking through regular cotton undershirts. (I hang them in the bath overnight to dry.)"
2.0,Just okay. Didn't get the material described.<br />Will probably throw it on when I'm not in a dress up type of mood for work.<br />Disappointed but hey it's cheap.
2.0,Can't go around neck broken the very same day I receive it
2.0,Very sheer and boxy.
2.0,it didnt fit me as well  its a nice dress otherwise
2.0,The inside or bottom of the sleeve were very short & fit too weird when compared to a regular fitting t-shirt.
2.0,Within 3 weeks the top outside stitching came apart
2.0,these earrings are not leather. they look and feel cheap.
2.0,I'm only giving this product 2 stars because they are so large that there is no way that you could use these on ear loops for face masks. The are quite large. More for a hat with draw strings.
2.0,Nicer than I expected but way too big
2.0,"The elastic makes them shiny/cheap looking, and the tops squeeze your thighs and give you a thigh muffin-top. I typically wear a size small (5’4, ~125#) but have thick-ish thighs and these are super unflattering on me. If you had very slim thighs these would be cuter!"
2.0,The bag is OK but the quality not really good. I just use it one week and the fabric inside the bag is already tore up. After three week the strap is broke to.
2.0,"Disappointed because it was not what I expected . Did not fit fitted, too long and loose."
2.0,Too small. Looked like it was barely attatched at the seams before use. Cheap materials.
2.0,"high cut leg openings, not what I was looking for. Sent it back."
2.0,"I ordered 2 sizes bigger than my normal size. After reading reviews before I ordered them and that was still too small, both around my chest and cup size.  They are well made and very cute, but they are way small!"
2.0,"I expected a size large to be loose on me, as I like sleepwear to be.  This shorty, although stretchy, was too tight for me to feel comfortable in it.  Also, the polyester fabric is thin but it still holds in heat and gets too warm to be comfortable for summer.  The style, with its racer back, is cute but otherwise, I was not impressed.  It seems cheap-looking to me."
2.0,"I was looking for a slouchy fit t-shirt. Was hoping this was like a Bella Canvas. It’s a slick, stretchy material that’s off-putting for me. 😩 The tag inside the collar is similar to Wish tags. Just a tab of fabric with XL on it.<br /><br />In Bella Canvas, I wear an XL for a slouchy, relaxed fit. I would order an XXL in this shirt. The XL fits like a large and it’s shorter than I expected.<br /><br />Just a disappointing purchase."
2.0,Bought this to go under my wedding dress hoping it would slim me down as well as keep the girls perky with cleavage.. This did the opposite it's bulky and it flattens my fairly large chest into a pancake.. I guess it's pretty but hard to get into.
2.0,The mask is poorly made. Bubbles in the rubber. It is impossible to see anything out of it. There is no hole to breathe through so it is sufficating. I put mine over a lamp shade. It made a cute haloween decoration.
2.0,"I'm a size Small in just about everything I own, sometimes an XS.  Bought a small and I was in full-on sausage mode in this set.  SIZE UP!"
2.0,I purchased these for my husband and when they came he tried them on and some areas were loose and some areas were too tight. My husband is an athlete and is not over weight at all so it was very weird these didn't fit right. Needless to say they were returned.
2.0,"I really loved the color of this bag in the listing, but it was so much darker than that. So disappointed."
2.0,"These are a disappointment. The separate pouch in front for the penis sounds like an interesting innovation, but no matter how many times I put mine in there, he always seems to find his way in back with the other equipment! More importantly, this wicking type material sounds good too, but it appears to make you sweat tin the first place, and do you really want that sweat brought out to your shorts or jeans? I want neither, so I'll stick to my previous favorite, the bamboo material with  nice sculpted pouch for the whole package! from David Archy. Never had better underwear, should have known to stay with them, better color too. I'll try these again in the winter months, see if they're warmer!"
2.0,One of the pairs of shoelaces was missing the aglect at the end and also one string was noticeably shorter than the other.
2.0,"Super bummed out. The shirt fit in every way except length. If it were the shirt in the picture it would have been fine, but it was ridiculously short :("
2.0,"It has a really strange fit on me. Below the bra line (bottom half) fit way too big. The chest was very tight, but I did just recently have a baby and am pretty large now. Still I ordered the largest size, and it looked awful. I’m about a size 12 now postpartum for reference. The quality was also a little lacking. It seemed nice enough for the money though."
2.0,The bra part is too small for DD cup size.  It didn't even cover my nipples.  I ended up returning it.  Love Amazon's return policy!  Hate bathing suit season.
2.0,"I loved it. The clip looks very stylish, modern and elegant, but I had to return it since it didn't serve the purpose - it wasn't flat. When you put the clip with or even without money in a pocket it looks like triangle...<br />Unfortunately I simply waisted my money on shipping back and forth.."
2.0,"The outfit fit ok, but the gold spikes on the arm were falling off.  It was so embarrassing!"
2.0,"I bought a size 3T. Fit was slightly small for my typical 3T granddaughter. Even though this was meant to be a fun play dress,  it was a disappointingly cheap dress."
2.0,"These things stretch relatively quickly, and failed to really accomplish what I got them for- they worked for MAYBE half a day, but were not comfortable and kept slipping."
2.0,"This is a super cute top,but not what I expected. I returned this item. It was less sweater and more like a heavy T-shirt. I expected it to be longer, but it barely came to my waist."
2.0,The fabric on the back wasn’t even sewn together to the lace very disappointed dice it was a gift for someone
2.0,"The mask is well made but too small. I have a small face and ordered a size large. The ear loops, even when fully loosened, are too short making it painfully uncomfortable. Also the fabric is so tightly woven it's suffocating. It sucks in and out like a gasping fish, which is pretty much how I feel when wearing it."
2.0,"The fit was good. However, It was sewn poorly and I returned it. The seam went down the front and just looked weird. Unless the company sewed the tag in the inside front, which is weird also."
2.0,"This bag looks great in the picture but the gold trim entirely too bright which makes it look cheap.  Love the purse, but hate the bling!"
2.0,I returned this item. The pictures make it look super cozy but the fabric has a super weird feel. I also bought the size based on my hips but I could have gone down a size. The top part was baggy.
2.0,Love the design but came broken. Piece won't screw in and stay.
2.0,"The posts and backs for this earring are super tiny and flimsy. I lost a back, and subsequently an earring, after 3 wears. Because the posts/backs are so small, they’re not interchangeable with other earring backs."
2.0,"The glare and darkness of the lens will have you flailing your hands in front of you so you don't run into anything...but you will look sexy doing it.  But seriously what do you expect, they're like $2 apiece.<br /><br />Don't wear these when operating heavy vehicles or doing things that need hand-eye coordination."
2.0,"Within 5 minutes of opening, two of the items broke. I couldn't justify paying over $20 for something that falls apart within minutes of use, so I ended up returning everything. The only reason I gave two stars is because it's a cute set and the return process was super easy."
2.0,"If you buy these, size down -  at least a 1/2 a size, if not a whole size.  It's a cute shoe, but the top strap is so loose it just hangs there, and it was so big there was at least a 1/2"" extra shoe behind my heel.  I still don't see how getting a smaller shoe will help because there is SO much gap between the top strap and my foot.  I could try and get a different size,  but I don't feel confident that would even help.  It is, however, a very cute shoe, with a solid heel that you could wear with dresses and capris!!<br />UPDATE:  What I also just realized is that I was sent the wrong shoe, so if my review is confusing that would be why.  There were 2 straps: one over my toes, and then another midway. There was not an ankle strap, which is what I ordered.<br />That being said, the seller did reach out to me after my review, so you have to hand it to them for customer service. Nonetheless, what they sent me is very cute, the issue was the sizing."
2.0,"Balled up after first use.  Super easy to tear, even with pet nails not that sharp.  The waist band is not connected inside so it rolls around and twists up.  Comfy, but probably wouldn't buy again especially for the price!"
2.0,This is definitely not a beanie hat it's more of a winter hat disappointed
2.0,"The writing wears off fairly easy and as you can see.And it has already broken, the Paracord that holds the writing piece on Has Broken. I thought paracord was supposed to be strong material.Disappointed as this was a gift."
2.0,"It's not a very bright light.  Quite faint.  It has to be super dark, like pitch black, for the light to show."
2.0,Size was way off... to big amd not adjustable
2.0,Not a fan of this crossbody bag
2.0,Will givwe it away ...
2.0,Cute glasses but they had a serial number printed right on the lense. Scraped it off and almost got it without damaging the lense but did end up wit a scratch. Really stupid that they printed on the glasses.
2.0,Todavía no me ha llegado y por esta razón no puedo operar
2.0,Socks would be 1000x better without the stupid word bamboo on the toes
2.0,"Scratchy, low quality shorts. I wonder if the other reviews are real?"
2.0,Runs large and not the nicest material. Colors are more neon than the image portrays
2.0,"Don't look like same dress, it's to big I ordered a large and it looks like an x-large"
2.0,"Product is of good quality however, it runs extremely small from sizing guide so I am not able to use it at all. It shrunk even more when I washed it so I was not able to use all. It feels extremly soft so I was disappointed that I was not able to use it. I would recommend this product for those who are buying for juinor sizes though"
2.0,"I would give only one star but hate is not the way I feel.  I know I would like this if it was in a larger size.  before I picked a size I read the reviews, looked at their sizing chart, and even was like a size bigger would be okay.  NOPE! I'm a 4/6 and in most of my swim suit I wear a small.  I got a medium. I cant even kind of fit in it and it be okay without being on the people of Walmart page.  You know that line when you know you should go a size bigger in something but you also know that the size bigger wouldn't fit you as good?  Well this was a I need 3 sizes bigger. It's cute but cheap material.  Not bad for the price."
2.0,"Great if it wasn't see thru. I'm talking wear this as a beach cover see thru, and I got black"
2.0,Need large chapstick like EOS stick. If you use regular size chapstick you’ll lose them all!
2.0,"Welp. Cute dress, but it came with a hole right in my buns. 🙃"
2.0,I ordered this dress in royal blue short sleeve. When I revived it it has long sleeves. I didnt send it back because I ordered for a special occasion. The dress is comfortable but I will only wear it in the spring.
2.0,I was provided a free sample from the seller in exchange for an honest review. You can see a full review and initial field test on my YouTube channel MiWilderness.<br /><br />Update: Second time using this pack the zipper to the main compartment fell off in my hand.<br /><br />They appear to be extremely thin pot metal and bend easily pulling right off the pack. I wouldn't be able to recommend this pack unless a better zipper was used.
2.0,I ordered a small it’sa med to large. Very upset
2.0,"Not for a plus size ankle I'm afraid.  they are quite pretty so I have given it to my daughter,"
2.0,These are really small. They almost feel like a thin paper. They don’t look anything like the picture and did not fit well for my body.
2.0,bonito pero el tamaño no se corresponde con las medidas
2.0,"It comes with 3 sizes of interchangeable nose bridges. Unfortunately, even the smallest one is wider than most other goggles. It is certainly too wide for me. Too bad - it is a BEAUTIFUL design."
2.0,Stoped fucntio ing after apprx 16 hrs of stand still.( not wearing it).
2.0,"Too small for me, I gave to my  niece, she loves them..."
2.0,"The Zirconia are much smaller than pictured, very disappointed."
2.0,did not work on my phone to good
2.0,The problem is it was hard to write on
2.0,I didn't know that this was best suited for a bathing suit cover up. I bought it as a dress for a day trip. It's a no go!!
2.0,"These are really cute and went well with my costume, the main issue I have with these is they don't stay put. I assumed you would be able to wrap this around your arm and it would stay on. But a few seconds after putting it on, it's falling off your arm. To stop this i had to wrap it around itself in a spiral so it would stay where i wanted, but it didn't look very cute. The picture shows how I had to had it wrapped in order to stay on."
2.0,not good quality. it's also not easy to deal with and the zipper broke maybe 1 month after i got the purse. not recommended.
2.0,Was  a nice dress but after only 1 use the seam on the side split. Very disappointing.
2.0,Ordered for my son. He wasn’t thrilled.
2.0,To short but mane well. I’m 5’8””
2.0,Looked fake and smelled funny. Went ahead and returned.
2.0,"Too small in the torso, arms and shoulders. Wish it would fit."
2.0,"Giving this bag 2 stars. Would have been 5 since I really love it, it fits everything I need to carry and more however I'm pretty sure this was a return at one point. I received the bag and opened the inner zipper pocket to find a toothpick in a wrapper and a broken toothpick which appeared unused. Not pleased. Also the side d-ring attachment's thread is loose as if it was used and worn at one point. The rest of the bag appears very sturdy but I think I will return this bag since it was sent defective."
2.0,"Most Men's 2x fit me loosely, but if I had to compare this one I'd say it's more like a regular xlarge and not a 2x.  It seems to be made well, but it's not stretchy like other tshirts and gas no give.  Flattens my chest like nobody wants to see haha.<br />Pretty expensive to even consider trying another size."
2.0,Beautiful when it’s came in the mail after wearing this chain for 2 weeks pretty much all the crystals came out
2.0,Definitely not waterproof. All other functions work well. We always buy kids watches from Amazon and have never had any problems with the waterproof feature until now.
2.0,"There was a tear in the thumb stitching on each glove. One was at least an inch long through the stitches. The other was less noticable. Still useable, and would have been nice otherwise. Lack of quality control."
2.0,This tee came in as a crop top!!!! Doesn't look like one on the model and I don't recall reading that it was but it was most definitely a crop top. Had to return it! Hate that about online shopping. Love that it's easy to do on Amazon.
2.0,Always slide down. Not happy with them
2.0,They ride down bad
2.0,"The style and fit were great but the fabric used is very light weight. I would have to purchase a full slip to feel comfortable in this dress., therefore I am returning it."
2.0,"First, there is no way these are sterling . Second, although they were packaged very well, they still arrived squashed flat. I tried to pry the petals up, but the metal is so hard (steel???), I couldn't do it. My husband finally did it but it wasn't easy for him either. Third, even after manipulating the petals and pistils, they are just not as distinct or defined as you see in the photo. Overall, these earrings were a disappointment."
2.0,"I've only had this band for 2 month, and I already have to replace it. The finish is wearing off leaving a copper/brass colored base metal showing.<br />Other than that, I like it."
2.0,Sweater runs very small very disappointing I bought it for a special occasion and couldn’t wear it.
2.0,HAD I bother to look at this ring closer before I bought it... I would have passed... Doesn't even have .... Eagle Anchor Globe... and the carving is second-rate...
2.0,Cheapy material .. look for another option!<br />I ordered the orange color- good luck with the rest :D
2.0,These socks run small and are extremely thin.
2.0,The print is nice .<br />That i do like.<br />The sizing off .I ordered<br />XL .fits awfully.<br />The fabric is like the Adidas warn up suits.thin and shiny and absolutely null in the warmth department.
2.0,"Do not buy. I've warn them 3 times and they are already coming apart. Will not last, very cheaply made."
2.0,I guess it was a little misleading because I thought it would be a lot larger than what it is.
2.0,"all I can say is, cheap and it does not  stay on your ear, will not buy ever again! you get what you pay for..."
2.0,"Was disappointed that, rather than being a typical T-shirt, it turned out to be made of a rayon-like silky fabric that was not ""breathable"" for a hot 4th of July day. It just made things feel ""sticky"" and uncomfy. Might be OK if you were to wear it in air conditioning all day."
2.0,"While the shoe looks nice, every time I take a step, it sounds like my feet are farting. It happens with the inserts in the shoes and the second optional pair of inserts. I work in retail and it's embarrassing. I don't wear them anymore—a waste of money."
2.0,Pretty quickly turned a copper color but it’s pretty
2.0,The pants are nice but the color is Peach not beige. Buyer beware.
2.0,Paint started chipping almost immediately.
2.0,This fit well and the seams were in the correct place. The material however is thin and a but scratchy as well. I do not plan to buy anymore like this but will keep this one.
2.0,I opened them up and gave them away immediately.  I couldn't tell it was a cat.
2.0,Pros:  This sweater is well constructed with evenly stitched seams and bindings.  Overall its a good quality product.<br /><br />Cons:  Color (Pink)  Be careful with this!  The pink color is definitely not as depicted in the photo.  Its a very strange muted brick color and there are not many skin tones that can pull this off.  I'm a light-complected blond and this color washes me out.  I would suggest ordering one of the other neutral colors instead.
2.0,I usually wear a medium so I order a large thinking it would be lose not so...if ordering order two sizes up...cute and correct color but not happy with the size!
2.0,if you have boobs don't buy
2.0,I purchased a larger size to accommodate for my top half and it was still too small. Mid area was too long but the bottom fit as expected. Cute but not wearable for me.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:a00092f93ce2681f982cc9f49c4cb5e0]] In the box it says the batteries are non replaceable! So I can’t even change the batteries to fix it. It sounds like it’s locating a demon instead of dragon balls. The other capsules are ok, each get a star but the main thing I wanted was the radar!!"
2.0,"Loved the look, amazing. But they are not squat proof at all!!! You can see everything, I ordered grey, orange, and brown. My tester pre-gym could read my underwear through it. Was very disappointed because loved the shorts but even just lounge wear the moment you bend over it’s over"
2.0,"it didn't fit, gave it away to daughter that wears a large. disappointed"
2.0,"It fits small.  Its a cute hat, but the fit on my head is pretty tight."
2.0,"This dress came quickly and fits well. It was cute and flattering. However, not enough padding to keep me in the top of the dress.  I also thought the bottom of the dress would flare more, but it doesn't. It wasn't the right kind of material to do so. Also, the little sleeves wouldn't stay in place kept rolling down as the dress had no support. I really wanted to keep this dress. Returning it and still searching for the perfect dress."
2.0,Poor size chart!
2.0,didn't fit at all as shown
2.0,The straps were thinner than anticipated and it cut into my armpits and it was very short. Already returned
2.0,Constantly fogging.  A pain while skiing!
2.0,The bathing suit I received was a different print than the one shown in the picture.
2.0,"A little tight to pull over the head (and I don’t have a big head.) Material doesn’t feel great, but may be softer over time/wash."
2.0,"Two out of 10 came with broken clasps. Unfortunately I've paid less for better quality, even at this level."
2.0,"I like the look of it,but the actual clip is too small. It's difficult to clip to your belt loops. I may go back to a climbing clip."
2.0,Materials are fine. Sizing is too small.
2.0,Cute earring and everything but doesnt fit in my ear. Cross is too big.
2.0,"Obviously,  a costumes piece, but the value hardly being even $8 USD. The tail went straight into the trash. Did not fit at at like a tail and did not add to the costume. The trident (as shown on the pictures, so no surprise there) is indeed very short and toy- like."
2.0,I gave 2 stars for one reason it didn't work for me. It could not hold 15in laptop. I wish it was an inch wider in that case it is perfect. Otherwise this would have gotten at least 4 stars. If you have smaller laptop this will be great and it looks very nice.
2.0,Good stuff but it doesn't lest very long
2.0,"The floral detail is not really Embroidered.  It was dissapointing to see it was a separate piece put on the sleeves with a few needle points.  If you don't mind that, than it would be an ok top."
2.0,"I like the look of the Fye Veronica style, nice leather, color etc. but the toe box in this style is so narrow and low, it's torture to wear them for any length of time.  I owned a pair of the knee high Veronica slouch boots and had the same problem that wearing or professional stretching could not fix. Because  of the pain they inflicted, I gave them away after hardly wearing them at all, but thought I'd try the 6&#34; high version in a half size larger. Same problem of being extremely narrow and tight even with a nylon sock on. If you have a narrow foot and want to give them a shot, at the very least order a half size bigger than  your usual size, a full size if you have a normal foot. I don't dare to even try another size at this point."
2.0,It's  a nice top but is not that I expected. The  accessories are nice. The material is different to chiffon as it was described.  The flounce design is not same as the picture posted (is more large). The top requires press or dry clean and it was not described in the description posted. The courtesy and service is excellent. My recommendation: update the top description and picture posted.
2.0,"To give you an idea of who I am and what I'm looking for... I keep my heat at around 55-65 degrees. I bought these because my feet have been getting colder than usual lately, and my intent is to find a slipper that I will be wearing a good portion of the day.<br /><br />These weren't as warm as the reviews led me to believe. The outside is made of a cheap material though the inside is nice and woolly and looks warm.  It was not, it just makes my feet sweaty and then the air current gets in and chills my feet. I will say they are comparable to other slippers you may try on at a department store.<br /><br />I went ahead and bought a pair or Sorel Manawans. They are a lot pricier, but they are just what I needed. Very warm, durable, and hopefully I'll get some extra years out of them."
2.0,"The top of the dress started to unravel after the first wash, :/"
2.0,"Once again, Asian sizes"
2.0,"Within 5 minutes of putting it on, lightly bumped my hand against the side of our couch and the stone popped out and shot across the room. Put it back in the prongs, but didn't look secure so I am returning it for a refund.<br />Item was nicely packaged and arrived on time, but just wasn't happy with the quality of the ring."
2.0,Stone fell off within a day of wearing it and it turned my neck green.
2.0,"This is just a cheap swimming suit. It's not slimming, the cut is not flattering to fuller figures, and the fabric is cheap. I've only had it 5 months, worn it 10 times and it's pilling."
2.0,"A 2XL is normally the perfect size for me, but after trying it on I could only button the top three buttons.<br />1 star because I like the color, 1 star because the sleeves, surprisingly, were not too tight like the rest of the blouse. I will probably return it."
2.0,This material is not a knit dress and more like a t-shirt dress.
2.0,I have set mine off 4 times now accidentally.  Not sure where to put it the pin comes out so easily. I purchased 3 got 2 free. I gave them to ladies in my family and they are all like that pin comes out to easy. So mine is setting on the kitchen table!!
2.0,I bought the pink with black lace and the lace seperated from the bra itself the first time i hand washed it. Also it says push up but it's not. It's lightly padded but the cups are all evenly padded instead of like normal push-ups where there's a little extra padding usually on the bottom to actually push up the girls.
2.0,"I really like the style, cut, fit and color of this dress. And it has pockets! But the bodice has a polyester lining that is terrible! How can they claim it’s 95% cotton/5% spandex when there’s clearly a good amount of polyester?"
2.0,"The material is like a swim suit. Also, very see through."
2.0,"It was alright, but it didn't fit."
2.0,in about 3 weeks I lost already the bracelet 5 times with basic activities. They are not secure enough.<br />Otherwise they look good but you can potentially loosing your Mi Band because of this.
2.0,Slinky material and overall a cheaply made dress. Fell apart after one wash.
2.0,Maybe they need to fix their size chart!  Because I ordered off of that.  But the items made in China run Way Small!  This like a US 6-8
2.0,"5’3”, 165 lbs, 34B.<br />Dress is super long. It had a super strong chemical smell, maybe like glue? It did become bearable, but was concerning that it smelled in the first place. It felt cheap and poor quality, especially for the price (~$75). It is a corset top, which is nice because it makes the sizing more flexible but is a hassle when it comes to putting on and taking off. The top was super loose, but I think it would’ve been a relatively easy fix to shorten. Overall, would not recommend."
2.0,The smell of the product is awful and the lake blue color is not even similar to the color shown. The strap is VERY cheaplt made as well. Returning this product.
2.0,"Unhappy with the quality of this dress. Top is somewhat see through. Also, I am 5’1” and the size small is way too long for me."
2.0,its not verry well made and was a lighter color than what was pictured
2.0,Didnt fit. Material felt cheap.
2.0,"Purchased these sunglasses as spares to use in situations where I’d be concerned about losing or damaging more expensive sunglasses. For $30 this pair looks nice and seems to be reasonably sturdy. Unfortunately in all but the most mundane conditions the lenses exhibit so much glare that these glasses are practically unwearable. They can quickly give a person a headache and can actually inhibit one’s vision rather than help. For the price, I probably won’t bother to return them and may just use them for travel to the beach or poolside. I wouldn’t recommend them for serious use though and would encourage buyers to invest in higher quality brands. Also, I would note that these are rather large frames and may not be a good cosmetic choice for people with slender faces."
2.0,Muy pequeño  para mi gusto
2.0,"I thought I ordered a black wood watch, but it has a very light colored spot. It was also packaged in such a way that, as a gift, I couldn't check the item over before wrapping. I was disappointed it wasn't solid color like the photo"
2.0,Shirt was fine it just looked like a pajama top.
2.0,careful to measure and ask questions
2.0,"My husband ordered this for me to replace the one I have that's showing it's age.  I LOVE that bag!  He was so excited to find one for me since I mentioned being disappointed about having to find a new Go To since VB website didn't have anything but a purple one (I'm not a fan of purple) & customer service rep made it sound like they were discontinuing this bag.<br />He chose the Bandana Swirl pattern.  He's been so excited for it to get here to give it to me.  His excitement faded this morning when it arrived.<br />The colors in the picture are way off from the actual product :(  I like the fall/wintery hues in the pic, but the neon sign that arrived in the mail, not so much.  And I was even more disappointed to open the bag & find the characteristic cloth that's found in all my other bags was not there.  Inside it's a thin, shiny black lining.  I wanted to love it so his efforts would be rewarded, but I can't let him spend $70+ on a bag that's just gonna sit in my closet.  It's going back :("
2.0,Cute style but ran very very small. Returned.
2.0,It smelled horrible.. and it's not real leather.
2.0,My daughter won't wear these.  Says they are too thin and stick to her face in an awkward way.  Returned.
2.0,"The boots were cute, but the sole separated from the boot and they were barely worn."
2.0,Says will fit 12-13 year old but more like an 8 year old. These run very small
2.0,Loose its elasticity after just 3 wks of wash and use.
2.0,Too thin for my liking. I returned them because of that.
2.0,It’s an ok band but it’s not what is pictured. The picture shows an actual clasp and this band is magnetic.
2.0,The quality was not as good as expected.
2.0,It's not a sweater it is and covers
2.0,Material was not as described.
2.0,I REALLY AND TRULY LOVE THE NECKLACE BUT THE CLASP HAS BROKEN LESS THAN A WEEK FROM ARRIVAL!
2.0,"I bought four of these tops- black, blue, rosered, and winered. Please see picture.<br /><br />The blue and black tops are as advertised. I normally wear medium or large tops and the large fit will. The inside of the garment has a soft, warm fabric.<br /><br />The rosered (bright pink) top is a different style. It's longer and the material is different/colder on the inside. It feels very cheap.<br /><br />The red top isn't anything like what I ordered. It's a wrap-around-front-tie-in-the-back kind of top and is very ""skimpy"". It's also a bright red, not the dark red I ordered. However, it does have the nice warm, soft fabric inside.<br /><br />If I'd have bought these shirts for their style, I'd be returning the pink and red tops. However, I bought these for sleeping and breastfeeding. It's surprisingly difficult to find comfortable, long-sleeve nursing shirts for a reasonable price. These were on sale for a third of the normal price and fit the bill, so I'll keep them."
2.0,"So thin. I had to use two at once to feel ""safe"".  The support for the nose is not firm."
2.0,"Washed the mask by hand and air dried them. They were a wrinkly mess afterwards. I even tried to iron the masks and was only able to get out 2/3 of the wrinkles. Also, they are harder to breathe through then a different brand of similar masks that I previously purchased. The elastic on the ear and the filter pocket that opens on both sides was just fine."
2.0,"They look stylin on my ten year old, though."
2.0,"I literally just took this out of the package. The waist is quite small for a 2XL - that was kind of expected based on my Amazon shopping experiences. There's also a big hole in the seam under the waist band. I'll see if my friend can fix it. If not, it's going back."
2.0,"First Simplee product I was disappointed in. Unfortunately bought it on AliExpress for a few dollars less than Amazon and won't return because of hassle. Although the picture and title make the sweater look like a turtleneck, - it is NOT- it is actually a very poorly shaped COWL neck. The sweater is not cut right- it is uncomfortable to wear and has no shape. Do not recommend it."
2.0,Size runs kind of small..
2.0,I had the product for a month and it broke. It would fall off my wrist.
2.0,I’ve had this jacket for a year and experienced zipper problems with it every day. I finally broke the zipper trying to get it down. Lesson learned. Listen to the reviews no matter how nice the jacket is otherwise.
2.0,The fabric colors don't match and the size runs small. I was never able to wear it
2.0,"Stiff fabric and super uncomfortable. The inseam is really short, which wouldn’t be a problem if the fabric were more flowy"
2.0,"I ordered this specific cat hat because it shows that it is the character Marie. The cat hat we received is clearly not Marie. Completely different face, and no pink bow.  I am attaching a picture to show what we ordered and were looking forward to, versus what we received. Keep this in mind if you are looking very specifically at the pictures shown.  The embroidery thread is also coming up on the eyes."
2.0,This shirt ran small then shrunk a lot in the dryer. It is nice looking but my husband can't wear it anymore. It was so hard to button the top button even before we washed it. Too bad because it is a nice dress shirt.
2.0,Didn't look good once I tried it on.
2.0,"Didn’t get all the nose rings, no L shaped, no straight bars. Super disappointed."
2.0,"Well, unfortunately this bag only lasted me 5 months.  Within 2 months the outside pocket zipper started getting stuck.  Then 2 months later the rubber stripping on both handles started to peel all the way off, making the strap uncomfortable against my skin.  One month later, the strap completely broke on my way to work.  I was carrying it every day, so it was getting a lot of use, but seems like it should have lasted longer."
2.0,Im a 38C and I thought it fit nicely but it didn't really provide any support
2.0,The shirt itself fit okay. Usually wear a unisex large or xl for more comfortable baggy fit. The shirt is very stretchy but form-fitting. The letters are cheap iron ons and won't last more than a dozen washes. Decent for price and only intend on wearing once.
2.0,"I usually wear a US medium with a 30"" waist. The size chart in the description implied the fabric is stretchy, and a medium would fit me. The sizes are not US, which is fine, but they're advertised as US, which is not. The fabric is extremely scratchy and rough, and I would not want to order a replacement. I returned them the same day they arrived."
2.0,Not watt I expected
2.0,They look great but they are so extremely thin that they already have holes in them after wearing them for one full day. Only two of the socks could be worn twice before having holes. So sadly I won't buy this again due to bad quality.
2.0,I love the design of the bag and the pattern of the material. I don't like the size. It's too small for school use. And too small for a shoulder bag. Makeup bag is about all it's really good for..
2.0,"Tthe tank materials was very cheap, it fit like a cheap shirt"
2.0,"Item was received damaged (pocket stitching was frayed). The arm lengths were disproportional to any normal chest/body size and did not match their sizing listed, but more closely matched the Amazon sizing for a smaller size. Image and colors were vivid. Material was decent weight for Northeast Springtime weather. Returning due to damaged goods and sizing issues."
2.0,The emblem was a cheap iron-on I could have done myself.  Had was just average quality.
2.0,"was not as expected, did not fit right...gave it to goodwill"
2.0,"I spent weeks researching this, and many similar products, and after so looking forward to its arrival, am very disappointed with this bag. Anyone who claims that a 13 inch laptop can fit in this bag along with ANYTHING else and without wrestling it in and out GINGERLY and diagonally is misrepresenting this product.  Is it sturdy? Yes. Is it well-made? Yes. Is it attractive? Absolutely. Is it useful? No, not for my purposes, which were simply for a laptop and a weekly calendar and a few writing instruments. If this bag were truly 15.8&#34; x 13.4&#34; (as the manufacturer states) I should have been able to slip my laptop in and out with ease. SADLY, RETURNING."
2.0,"Junk. Band is cardboard type paper. Crystal is not crystal, but cheap plastic and assembly is poor. It does work.. Surprise"
2.0,You need to have SUPER long fingers for this glove to fit properly.
2.0,"These are really nice earrings, but I bought them for my 8 year old and they are just too heavy for her ears and are bigger than I realized.  Guess I should have realized the size by the description."
2.0,The pockets are on the outside of the shorts.  Sort of a novelty I suppose.  If the pockets weren't this way it would look a lot better because they do look decent If only the front pockets weren't literally hanging out in front of the shorts.
2.0,Not to size chart
2.0,"Poor quality printing.  Arrived with a glob of printing material on the lettering.  Sent back for refund.  Also, runs 1-2 sizes small.  I usually wear small, sometimes medium, and the large fit.  I'm 5&#34;2, 116 lbs with broad shoulders for reference."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:532baf739b8554ff8815ae5a7387ee03]] Not as well put together and picture
2.0,These masks are sewn so that the message cannot be easily read when wearing. And isn’t that the point ??
2.0,Elastic. Real waist rads is made with thread like material. These can pop easy after a few wears .
2.0,Once on they completely covered my footwear and kept them dry during the entire use.  However after the second use while attempting to remove them it ripped from the ankle causing me to toss them in the trash.
2.0,"Based on the reviews, I assumed this would fit. I was wrong. I am 5'8&#34; and got an xl and it was super short."
2.0,Not that heavy of material. One of the few disappointments I’ve ordered of Amazon. Usually love the products. This one was not one of them
2.0,Product was too loose to wear but too tight to get my hand in. Also may charging my watch a task because I have a stand for my watch to charge on at night and the band was not compatible with the stand I ultimately abandon this product because it is cheap did not fit well and did not work for me and how I use my watch
2.0,These leggings are my favorite but the inner leg seam rips pretty easy. I’ve had to sew them three times and now there’s another hole.
2.0,"It was beautiful! Once I washed it though, hundreds of little elastic strings were sticking out everywhere on the lacy part. Blah. Oh well, it was cheap and was perfect for one event!"
2.0,Took FOREVER to arrive.  Pretty but flimsy
2.0,"These ran a bit large for my daughter. She was so excited to get them for Christmas, only to find out they didn't fit her. It was dissapointing. :-("
2.0,recieved in one plastic baggie. all jumbled with no size markings...also had one extra 6 gauge size and wasmissing one 2 gauge and one 0 gauge...VERY dissapointing
2.0,Lovely print but the fabric is thin and stitching doesn't seem like it will last long. I don't recommend buying it.
2.0,"Value for money is terrible, cheap soft metal of clip literally tore where i was flexing it while trying to get the single clip near base of tail to hold the heavy top in place. Had to spend additional money to buy super glue and 2 heavy clips to repair it. Terrible giftable item if you want recipient to continue to like you.<br />If you DONT have arts and crafts skills, dont buy this!"
2.0,The thread came apart in three different places on the pants so now the pants has three holes
2.0,"Beautiful product, fits perfectly, coor is more of a copper than rose gold, though."
2.0,"Tried the bracelet it on. Snagged on my shirt.<br /><br />Looks real at quick pass, with similar markings you'd see on real VCA."
2.0,Not at all the color showed.
2.0,Pants run small and fabric is very thin. Had to return them.
2.0,"I am about 5’6 and 120 pounds and typically wear a 25-26 in jeans, so I ordered an X-SMALL in these jeans and they are HUGE. They completely fall off"
2.0,"I’m 5 “3, and these are very large. They also aren’t very soft or comfortable on the face or around the ears. The black color is nice but that’s about it."
2.0,I gave this to my friend  as a Christmas gift  after 3 monts its broke..So sad hearing it. But the color is nice...
2.0,"The band starts to slip out. I was able to put the original band back on and have it stay in without a problem, so I don't think it's user error. I wouldn't buy again. Maybe this is why Apple wants $40 for their strap."
2.0,Don't recommend it if you are going to wear it for a long time
2.0,Nice coat but runs very small
2.0,Did not have size right
2.0,"The pic shows a free flowing fabric, but when I received it - the fabric was hard and rigid."
2.0,Nice looking shirt. I bought the white one for work and the fit is great but the make quality is not worth $22. The buttons are not sown on correctly and are falling off and 1of the button holes is completely stitched over. So now I have to fix the shirt before I can even wear it.
2.0,If it doesn't fit it's no good. It runs extremely small.
2.0,Not as described by pictures
2.0,The arms are super tight.  Doesn't seem to be a right ratio for. Idy to arms.
2.0,The material is so soft and flimsy and adheres to the blouse I was wearing. It runs small. Not flattering and no shape.
2.0,"Personally, I wouldn’t recommend or purchase again. They’re okay for a quick fix or if you’re looking for something cheap and easy. I used mine for the necklace my husband gave me on our wedding day. After a while, it got very dull and has even turned green which I normally don’t see in sterling silver but perhaps it can happen. I’ve tried cleaning it gently and wearing it less, but it lost its luster."
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this dress! I ordered the rose navy which was absolutely beautiful. The fabric is very soft and seems to be well made. I ordered a large (I'm a size 12-14, 38DD). It fit a little loose in the waist. Unfortunately, the material stretched too much around my chest and could very easily see my nude colored bra. If I choose to wear it, it'll have to be in the spring/fall, when I can wear a jean jacket to make the sheerness less obvious."
2.0,"It sure was beautiful! I really liked it, But had to return it, The post that goes into the belt has a seperate ball end, which fell off, so it was not useable. It is a shame! very beautiful buckle!"
2.0,"There were a lot of threads hanging from the jacket I received. The leather felt very thin, the zipper said ykk all over it but it didn't zip very well and it didn't look like a new zipper so i can only assume that it was a knockoff. I also had an issue with the collar, the leather was very stiff and a little too tall so it wasn't comfortable at all. Basically the collar was above my chin.... I ended up sending it back for a refund. At the end of the day I know you get what you pay for and if my intention was to have a costume jacket i think it would have been fine. I was looking for a daily wear fully functional / durable copy of the HDMM jacket. I found a company that uses good leather, double stitches the seams and will even add the CE armor. Obviously the cost will be more but I'm ok with that. Outfitter jackets did process my refund quick and without any issue."
2.0,Received this item today.  The material is nothing like what is in the picture.  The picture looks like it is a soft fuzzy fleecy material and it is more of a smooth shiny polyester.  It is still pretty cute so I will keep it since the price was right.  Hopefully it washes well.
2.0,Cute shoes does not fit.  Two or more sizes to small.
2.0,I returned it.  to short or my dress.
2.0,The heel part is too narrow but will wear
2.0,"I ordered a pretty large size, but -although they fit - they were 1 size too small, and feel very tight."
2.0,Returned.  Didn’t look like the photo or fit the description.  Was just a regular gray sweatshirt you can buy at Target or Big Lots.
2.0,"I've bought several belts similar to this one from different vendors/stores over the years and I thought, ""Why is this one so tight!?"", so I lined it up with my other belts on my bed and this belt is a good 2"" shorter (factor in the stretch of the waistband and you're missing more like 4"" from belt length) than my other belts. The belt size says O/S. I'm a size 8/10 and this belt is uncomfortable and will get return. Bigger than my size? Skip this belt."
2.0,These socks and NOT easy to get on or off
2.0,"Gave them to my wife less than 2 weeks ago, and the stone fell out this morning."
2.0,Love the look and the color. Not sure if just a defective one but the prongs that attach it to my vivosmart 3 don't stay tight. They will just come unlatched and my watch has fallen off while wearing it several times.
2.0,"Durag - VERY thin.  Not fitted, nor stretchy where it would matter.  Stretch the tail, it immediately looses shape.  The wraps are WAY too wide, like wtf-wide.  Very nice silky texture, but just doesn't seem durable enough.<br />Cap - too big, and I have a big head.  Nice material though, should've made the durags out of it.<br />Wouldn't recommend for wavers, might be alright for other hairstyles<br />I don't like it at all."
2.0,Much smaller than what it looks like in the picture. Didn't realize it was one attached bracelet. Difficult to latch it yourself.<br />I got it for my 14 year old daughter but wouldn't personally wear it for myself.
2.0,Arms and legs run very short. Pants are like capris.
2.0,"The pearls are nice.  But the cubic zirconia is way larger than the image shown, making the entire earring large and awkwardly sized.  I don't like wearing them as they feel too big and bulky."
2.0,I love the style but the color was VERY pink.
2.0,Hurts to have in for a long length of time
2.0,I usually  order a size up but this was to big. Order your normal size or even a size down
2.0,Cute. But fell off quickly.
2.0,I’m an adult and this was too big for my head.  Not really happy how it fits.
2.0,I didn't like that the description said they were waterproof but the water was seeping through the seams. I guess I can't step in any puddles. Also they are not for cold weather although they have fur inside.
2.0,"So disappointed!  I ordered the Be Kind t-shirt, and loved it!  It was so  soft and comfy that I had to buy more. The chrysanthemum shirt was NOT the same, despite the exact same product description!  It is a square, boxy, stiff  Gildan brand shirt...  AND does. It fit. Definitely won’t purchase from this company again."
2.0,"I’m so sad because I actually REALLY love this shirt... but I bought my normal clothing size and anytime I really move my arms in just about any direction, the button on the top of the shirt comes undone... good thing I was wearing an undershirt or it would’ve been really awkward for my co-workers that are majority male...<br /><br />I will probably try to sew in a button or something to make it hold but the current fastener just doesn’t hold up at all even though the shirt is my correct size. So just a warning ladies! Wear an undershirt if you buy this shirt!!!"
2.0,"the way the waistband hits my hips just does not work for me. I have wide hips but the compressive waistband hits right above hip bones so it emphasizes a really weird shape on my body. and it's too big around my legs. i never wore these and should have returned. I'm sure these work fine on other body shapes, just didn't work for me."
2.0,"I ordered the grey/pink version of this sweat shirt and loved it, so I decided to order the back/white one too. The black one is a different fabric than the gray one and doesn't fit nearly as nice. Not nearly as nice as I had hoped."
2.0,"I ordered two different models of pants form Clotin Company. One claimed to be windproof and other claimed to be waterproof. What I received was a same pair of pants, made out of same material and the only difference was that one pair had side pockets.<br /><br />These pants are NOT waterproof, they are not even water-repellent. I simply sprinkled material with two handfuls of water and after wiping water off with my hand lining on the inside was already damp. Just imagine how good of the time you would have while hiking or camping during a rainy day.<br /><br />Fit is great! I'm 5'10&#34; and 170 and size US L was perfect. Just be careful because similar model was size US M.<br /><br />Similar Model: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O0TVAHY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
2.0,"I wear Wacoal bras and have bought many, so I took a chance on the Awareness model, thinking it would fit like previous Wacoal bras.  But it didn't.  The cups seem a bit smaller.  The band is always tight, but they give a little after a while, but I never expected the cups to be smaller.  Bummed."
2.0,Too small...and turned
2.0,It was our second time purchasing these shoes. My son is learning how to walk in a walker and often lets his feet drag - the result is the holes in the soles after only 2 weeks of wearing them! The first pair wore off similarly but after about 3 months. The only way I can explain it is that the soles were made of poorer quality material.
2.0,I was so excited to come home and get my dress today. But unfortunately when I opened the package the dress is falling apart. It does seem like it would fit but I’m having to take it to go get it fixed before I can try it on as I don’t want to cause anymore damage to the dress. I’ll update when I get it fixed and get to put it on.
2.0,The plastic snaps can break relatively easily. They can pull right out of the fabric and become impossible to put back in.<br />The face mask also fogs the goggles with your breath.<br />It's cool looking but I recommend it be used only for a costume piece rather than functional winter wear.
2.0,"These probably work better on younger girls. I’m 24 and often need to tie my hair up for work, I wanted something that wouldn’t slip back but these didn’t last more than two hours before they started to slide up my head."
2.0,"I found these to be very unflattering and thin material. If you squat you'll see underwear. Also there is no difference in the cut between the front and the back, and there is no tag or other marking to notate which way to wear the leggings. So there is no room in them if you have a bigger booty and they pull down in the back.<br /><br />The bra however is comfy so I'll be keeping it just for that part since returning the set would cost me extra money."
2.0,"I purchased the multi-color scarf (with orange/blue/yellow square pattern).  The color was nothing like what was shown in the picture.  The color of the scarf is actually very bright, not muted as shown in the picture.  Also, the fabric was very thin and flimsy; the scarf did not drape as shown in the picture.  The scarf had a rolled hem which to me looked very cheap on a scarf.  I returned this scarf."
2.0,"Bought these for my 5 year old so she could put them on herself. They looked cute and fit great, but did not hold up at all. I purchased them in October and they were done by New Years."
2.0,"Extremely thin, these won't work for my Soccer players but may work at give aways for my business IF we are able to use the heat press on them."
2.0,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews and ordered the large, but now that I've seen the swimsuit in person, I don't even know if that would have been enough.  I am 5'7&#34;-5'8&#34;, 130llbs, typically a size 4, sometimes a 6, and I don't wear a large in anything, so I ordered the Medium.  It's actually comical how small it is.  Definitely not long enough for my torso and basically looks like a thong.  On both sides.  I really wonder what's going on in the picture because this swimsuit appears to be made for an American Girl doll.  And since it's not Prime, it's a pain to return.<br /><br />I had no problems with the seller - shipping was quick and they were responsive regarding my return.  However, I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you are extremely petite."
2.0,Might have been cute it it wasn’t huge...I’m a small in normal brands but the small in this for like a large.
2.0,The shades were bigger than I expected
2.0,I was extremely dissapointed with this mask.<br />The nose bar would not conform to the shape of my nose and absolutely no air escapes this mask so it is hard to breath.
2.0,"What is pictured is not how the shirt lies, there are no pleats. It’s okay, I needed a shirt, so I keep it. The color is nice."
2.0,Did not like or use. Hard to style
2.0,"Pros: perfect size for a Mazda 3 key fob. The fit and finish of the 2 pack of rings was excellent. The screw kept the d ring kept closed with a little rubber o ring on it, didn't require loctite as I had thought.<br /><br />Cons: Broke with less than a week of use, the ring separated from the D Shackle ""see picture"". Thankfully I had my keys in my bag and I didn't lose the key fob. And as others have stated, the screw requires a small screwdriver and some forceps to pull the screw out of the d ring. The weakest part of the whole assembly is the rivet that joins the two parts."
2.0,"I hate giving bad reviews, so I'll start buy saying that the shipping was extremely fast for an international order. Also, the item does look like it appears in the picture. BUT.... The item is very poorly made. My daughters came with plastic strings hanging off the entire flower section. It looks like a spider has taken over it. Also, my daughter is 14 month & 20 pounds, we couldn't even get it over the back part of her head. Order at your own risk!"
2.0,Ordered a 5X but it fit like a 1X
2.0,The shoe is cute and I actually ordered a size 10 and a size 11 .  I was going to give one of them to a friend of mine .  I wear a size 9.5 and the 10 fits like a 9. The size 11 fits like a 9.5 with no sock. Where is a boot without socks even if it's a thin pair socks one of the shoes has a big dirty/oily spot on it. These will be returned
2.0,After the first wash the blouse completely lost its shape! ... I even laid it down flat making sure it was even.  The first wear is perfect just don't wash it.
2.0,I normally wear a 2xl comfortably and if I want baggier a 3xl.  I order a 4 Xl just to be safe and it’s way too small... doesn’t even zip.
2.0,Liked them for a minute but one of the ear pieces broke off.  O well.
2.0,"Didn't care for the feel of them, or the stitched line down the front."
2.0,Broke after just a few weeks of wearing
2.0,Was hoping to use these for my sublimation printing.  So so thin and I am very disappointed. Also came very wrinkled.
2.0,Ordered a medium...i thought youth but got a medium adult. Wanted me to buy another before exchanging this one...whatever
2.0,I love the way it fit and I love the color.
2.0,Glasses were good... but I had to return as I Recvd defective item.
2.0,Dress looks very cheap in person. The top lace portion is bright white while the bottom is almost a cream. The bottom portion is cotton and looks very cheap.
2.0,Too tight fitting shows all your curves...
2.0,"I ordered white - very thin. My husband asked if I was going to wear an undershirt because he could see every detail on my bra thru the shirt. It's cute, not exactly like the picture. The lace is not as nice or as well sewn into the shirt. The band of lace that appears to run the seam of the underarm is actually not attached to the shirt - it just hangs like a flap."
2.0,"First off the material used was very nice, however it wasn't like a typical jersey, it felt more like a wind breaker. I also liked the pattern and the colors were what really drew me to this jersey. 5/5 on looks.<br />The 2 star rating was for them sending me the long sleeve version, which I didn't want. I wanted the short sleeve one, which is what I purchased. Also, I have only bought medium jerseys for the last 10 years and they have always fit. I am 5'10 /140lbs. This was really very tight, had no wiggle room, and did not feel like any medium I have ever worn. I got 2 other medium jerseys the same week and they both fit fine. I did return it and got a refund."
2.0,Poor quality material and too big!
2.0,"Returned them, the fit was just weird, and my daughter thought they were brown not purple. We both thought they were sooooo close to usable, but she also felt they were too scratchy."
2.0,"In the product photo, the lightning bolt appears to be sparkly/glittery. It is in fact NOT! I was pretty disappointed but the shirt is soft and stretchy and fits as expected."
2.0,"It’s a very nice collar to go under shirts, but it is VERY uncomfortable. To make sure the bottom of it doesn’t wrinkle, you need to wear a tank top over it. The straps on the side are right under your armpits and dig into you."
2.0,The time was't right and keep change to 12:00 all time
2.0,"I was so excited for my waist trainer to arrive, ordered what I assumed was the correct size and as soon as I put it on I just knew it wouldn't be the right fit. I can't even clasp it untied. The materials look sturdy and it's so pretty but I don't think I'll be wearing it in this size for a long long time if ever."
2.0,I ordered a 4x because I felt like it was going to be to small. And in a 2xl-3xl 😩
2.0,Too short will have to wear knee length tights underneath. The lining is quite short.
2.0,They didn't work for me.
2.0,Bought for my son they are so big they fit my 260 pound husband and one of the pockets was  sewn halfway closed very disappointed
2.0,"Update: 7 months later, the screw came out somewhere and the clasp's thumb part disappeared. Luckily, we didn't lose the key. Will not be purchasing this again.<br /><br />I love this thing. It looks kinda sci-fi, and has been durable so far. We have one set of keys for a shared vehicle, this let my husband and I snap it on and off between the two of us as needed. I technically gave it to him for father's day, so as a gift, it was also nice. It came in padded gift-y looking box like jewelery. Looks very high-end."
2.0,"T-shirt is 50% cotton, 50% polyester--NOT 100% cotton as described."
2.0,Nowhere in the description showed this cute shirt to be dry clean only.
2.0,A shamrock broke off the post after a couple of uses. I might be able to superglue it back on. Looked nice while they lasted.
2.0,Runs 2 sizes small.
2.0,"So you might be wondering why the low reviews when it fit... I ordered a one piece red bathing suit (off the shoulder) and got a two piece one shoulder.<br />It fits but as a woman over 50, sometimes you just don’t want all the lumpy bits on display. I’ll keep it because my trip is too soon to send back. Quality Assurance in packing please!"
2.0,"I have a garmin forerunner 15 watch. When I recived this band, it seemed to be fairly good, but when I tried to put it on my watch, it did not fit. The small tab in the middle was too wide to fit onto the watch correctly."
2.0,Had to give this away because size is too small for an adult.
2.0,I must have missed that it was see through. The picture doesn’t look see through to me. Fits fine but never would wear
2.0,WEAR NO SUPPORT WALK SOLE FEEL HARDLY  NO RECOMMEND ONE
2.0,These felt about 2 sizes too small! I tried to return and UPS told me it would cost more to send them back then what I paid for them. Disappointed!
2.0,The reason for the two star review is because of the lock. The lock on this case is very hard to use and it feels as if the key is going to break if you keep locking it. This case would be great if you do not need to lock it.
2.0,"If you want a pare of shorts to just throw over a bathing suit this is a good option. But if you wanted to wear these to a event then I would not, cheep material and see through."
2.0,"Yes, they will stretch if u are a 2x but they don't look good stretched so far as the design then spreads and don't look like classy cute photo at all. Maybe if they weren't so cheap as a company and used more of the stretchy material so it would not stretch out of shape then u could see more of the design on a heavier person.  I may would not buy again it's all hype keep ya money. Pictures are not worth a thousand word as this product is horrible"
2.0,Weird material. I returned.
2.0,"This is pretty disappointing. Like something off of a Halloween Dracula's costume. Which, coincidentally is the only thing i would recommend this item for."
2.0,Received and they were crooked
2.0,It’s really cute. Fits the key perfectly BUT not even 24 hours later my key is GONE.  Needs a better “chain”.  Or a ring should be included that will fit  So now I get to go get a key made
2.0,"I'm waiting to hear back from customer service. I just opened the dress today. The fabric is good the dress appears to be well made, but it is not the featured rockabilly style. The whole reason i purchased this. If it was good I had planned on buying 5-6 more for my dancers.<br /><br />Also, my husband who is clueless about fashion could tell with me just holding up the dress. (That's bad!)<br /><br /> Their customer service reached out and basically said you can have half your money back or you can ship it back at your own dime. I was unhappy with this since it was misrepresented as rockabilly. If they had said hey it's a Hawaiian fitted dress and I didn't like the fit I would be perfectly happy paying for my own shipping. But this is clearly a misrepresentation on their end. Not happy"
2.0,Over all the rain coat was nice fitting and still had room to fit clothing underneath. But I was wet the whole time.
2.0,"SO... its cool it has Bluetooth to your phone...but the screen is very very dark and is hard to see the letters inside the dial unless you are in well lit area... very dim letters makes it hard to read at a glance. Also when the hour and minute hands are pointing to bottom of the screen, it does block most of the digital dial and you cannot make manual adjustment to the two hands. somewhere between 1 mile it is not consistent in keeping the step count. I got it for $120. Would I rather buy fitbit? yeah."
2.0,Honestly I thought I would love this dress but I am not a fan of the green color. The picture shows a more blueish green but it's actually very green. Also it fits pretty weird and shorter than I expected. I guess I should have measured out the measurement from the size chart. I guess I will know for next time. I won't be buying one of these dresses again.
2.0,"Was too small, can’t wear them, :-("
2.0,"I found this to be very bulky and difficult to use. I prefer to look under it (as if it's a solid visor) than look through it. It leaves a sizable gap between where the visor extender starts and where your original visor ends, which sometimes is exactly where the sun is. This has smacked in the face a few times while I was trying to reposition this to my side window. And it prevents you from using the visor mirror. I am no longer using this product; too much trouble than it's worth."
2.0,Mine came off too when trying to put it on.  I put reading glasses on to see if there was some way i could fix it.  I was surprised to find that one end screwed on.  After messing with it for a time i was able to put it back together.  However i had trouble getting it in as the L is so small i couldn't get it to go through withought straigtening it some.
2.0,I ended up returning this dress. I purchased originally in my search for white dresses for my bachelorette party. Aside from the area where there is a “built in bra” lining- the entire dress is see through. Very unfortunate as it’s otherwise a great looking dress. I’m sure another color wouldn’t have been as see through.
2.0,"If you don't mind using scissors to cut down all your cards and anything you insert into a normal plastic insert then this item may not be too bad.  Even normal sized business cards must be trimmed on the ends because they stick out well beyond the insert lip making it difficult to fold over.  I just converted my old worn out insert to the new one so I can't make any evaluation to durability or how well the plastic maintains clarity.  I didn't try to find another that would hold my wallet contents or try to return, but next time I buy I will pay more attention to size and other minor details."
2.0,"The color is perfect, it's everything you're looking at in the preview. But the strap broke right off after wearing for merely two weeks. I had wished the stitching were better, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,It looks nice but it broke on the first use.  People that work in flight baggage can be careless with luggage and they ripped the material away from the zipper near the handle.  There is about a fingers length tear in the largest of the 3 bags leaving it unusable...
2.0,Very thin. Good for bed.
2.0,They don't fit right and actually hurt when you put them on.
2.0,"One shoe fits the other falls off, the stitching is coming apart after a week. The soles leave scuff marks on the linoleum. They are warm and have good support for a slipper. I dont believe they'll last more than 2 months"
2.0,Too heavy and doesn’t hold well to your ear.
2.0,"Maybe this dress is better suited for a warmer climate. I purchased for a Midwest November wedding and the fabric was so sheer/thin, it just wasn’t gonna happen. Disappointed as the style is cute."
2.0,"Size fit as expected.  I have the same shoe in leather which fits fine, but something in the lining of this pair literally rubbed my foot the wrong way. Couldn't take a pain free step so had to return them.  Good looking shoe though."
2.0,"One of the stones fell out of the wire set literally within 5 minutes.  I’d love for someone to tell me what to do. Send it back or will you send a replacement. The clear one is the one the messed up, and it’s the one I like the most."
2.0,Lost screws after a few weeks of use . Emailed support with no response . Waste of money
2.0,These are way thinner than I had hoped they'd be. Previous reviews sounded good so I took a chance -- should have saved my money. And the fit is large for a ladies size.
2.0,"Shirt is very cool. But instead of getting a white string for the hood, guess what? I got a rainbow gay pride string. Honestly, I would not care that much but it is a gift for my adult son. He isn't as understanding about this issue as I am."
2.0,"Theses have no Velcro closure and are virtually impossible to pull on. They run small, as all the gloves I own are an XXS and I couldn't get a small on in these. They are however made nice and look good."
2.0,Not what I expected and it was way to short for me. Sent it back.
2.0,"This is a ""wrap dress"" that is designed to tie in the front, essentially leaving your breasts exposed. I don't see how it can be worn as anything other than a kimono or bathing suit cover. The picture is not an accurate depiction of how the dress actually fits over a body."
2.0,"I know I know what can you expect if you buy cheap sunglasses? I'm the queen of cheap sunglasses. Just a few days of having these and the lens popped out. Easy to pop back in but you know.. Pretty shoddy. These are now my backup sunglasses, shoved aside in my car somewhere."
2.0,The watch was very sleek and stylish in appearance. I encountered numerous times the watch band would come unlatched when I would bend my wrist. Very disappointing.
2.0,expected a much smaller hat being it was considered an extra small
2.0,Just got these in the mail. They arrived stained. The reason why these pants are getting two stars & not one is because they fit really well. I'm gonna try getting another pair..
2.0,We have been using these since received in April 2020.<br />Not impressed how the snap pops off after just a couple uses.<br />Poor quality
2.0,Very cheap looking overpriceda
2.0,"It’s nice to have all the different crystals, but be aware that it doesn’t come in a proper box to keep in.<br />The bottles are small and contain just as small crystals."
2.0,We bought this for part of a Halloween costume and it's only good as a paperweight. Disappointed that it wasn't the size we needed but my husband loves it on his desk so it worked out. Do not recommend if you're looking for something cool for a costume. Soda can for size reference.
2.0,pads slipped out of place couldn't get them right after putting on the suit
2.0,"This runs very small. I would size up if you're purchasing. I guess this could look cute on some people. But this type of slick and tight material really clings to, and accentuates, the WRONG areas. Aka the tummy area. Which is exactly the opposite of what I was hoping this top would do."
2.0,It was cute but fell apart and lost the sweet thing
2.0,Bought this for a music festival. Material was not what I was expecting. It’s not a form fitting outfit. Not sure if it’s because of my size that it just didn’t work out. I got a small and I’m 5’6” and 110lbs.
2.0,I received a red purse for Christmas 2 years ago and loved the purse. After using the purse for 2 years every day it finally neede to be replaced. I decided to purchase the teal  color for the replacement. I was so excited to get it and was so disappointed arter using the real bag for just a day the magnets won't hold the purse together and it's really frustrating and annoying. Now looking for another replacement. Not happy.
2.0,"Not very secure fastening!  They are pretty.  However, After clicking the earring securely in place, I find the earrings keep opening spontaneously, with very little disturbance.  If I even pass a cotton tipped swab gently inside my outer ear, they pop right open!  I almost lost one while sleeping.  I only still have it because it fell into my ear canal & stayed thete until I woke up & felt it!  😲"
2.0,I have gotten compliments on this ring but I've only been wearing it since June and the gold is so worn off. I'm not even sure if it's actually gold plated or just paint but the cheap metal is exposed already. I have a metal allergy so I put clear coat on it to keep from having a reaction but those with metal allergies should be wear
2.0,BEWARE!  Don't be fooled like I was. The description says this (Ytuieky) is an American company. The items are clearly marked Made In China.  I feel they have misrepresented their product.
2.0,"Highly anticipated, but unfortunately disappointed.  These hearts looked so cute, I really had high hopes from the reviews. Unfortunately, the 00 gauges arrived and we're not only too small in circumference but the length was too long as well. The hearts made my ear lobes sit out. Maybe I need to go up a size. But be warned these plugs run small."
2.0,"This ring is not 925 silver, it turns copper after a few times wearing it and turns finger green. Definitely not 925. I feel I deserve a refund,"
2.0,Material was uncomfortable and the mesh goes way to low. Poorly designed.
2.0,"I bought an XL because the description mentioned that sizes run small. A L shirt normally fits, but this wasn't even close and I couldn't button it. I'm guessing I would have needed to buy an XXXL to get that one that fit."
2.0,"i had a bodysuit that used to fit perfectly, his wasn't like that. it had a hole in the leg it was too shinny like silk all spandex no cotton and it shows every curve, every lump, but if that's your style go for it."
2.0,"I am and older person and these were not comfortable, hard to get the back on and didnt sit right as they were very heavy for a stud."
2.0,Very small & impossible to close!
2.0,Clasp is flimsy and lost it first day
2.0,"Thee single most comfortable bra I’ve ever worn.  Would have given it 5 stars but only 1 bra was delivered, not 2 like it says."
2.0,"Nice looking purse, I would say it's a hard shinny vinyl thou, not a soft nice leather.."
2.0,I so wanted to love these but for 48 i cant justify. They are very thin and they have a weird chemical smell.  But the color is nice.
2.0,I ordered the biggest size for my 4 yr old and it looks like it'll fit a 2 yr old. Disappointed and won't be returning because it's not worth the shipping or the hassle. Would've loved if this fit. In their defense the outfit it cute.
2.0,"Fit great, nice material, came fairly quickly, only problem it's supposed to be SLEEVELESS. BOTH shirts came with sleeves. Luckily I can sew, had no time to send them back. NOT happy about that."
2.0,"Hi, I was pleased that my order came in rather quickly but most my lip rings ended up breaking. I have like two left out of all that I ordered due to the fact that they won't screw in correctly. I am requesting for either a refund or a new package of lip rings. Thank you."
2.0,"Does not fit as expected, a little tight needs more room to move around head, will not buy another one"
2.0,Size was not right too small  and I pick a larger size as suggested
2.0,They seem soft however we paid for a size large but got a size small so we returned them
2.0,"I returned this because I thought it looked cheap in person.  It is a very shiny silver color, which I liked."
2.0,Completely wrong size. And I know I paid for the bigger size.
2.0,"I’ve never had issues with sizing…till these were delivered. They’re like half as long as my daughters foot. Not half a size. Half the size of her whole foot. Unless they were tagged incorrectly for the size, I don’t even know what to say. And considering the fact that she’s 3.5, what kid that size would need real ballet shoes?"
2.0,"Looking like military underwear with a heavy waist band. Fits like military underwear also high crotch , ride down low or hang down pants leg. Should have returned but I ripped off tag."
2.0,I understand that this is an affordable dupe but having it come in the mail with the stitching falling apart isn't acceptable
2.0,Jacket perfect. Pants too small
2.0,Keeps time well but feels like aluminium foil on your wrist almost no weight very cheap watch. For every day use not worth half the price but to kick around still too much $. Don't even bother.
2.0,"Very thin, and supposed to be a 5x, but actually smaller than an XL."
2.0,"Not &#34;flat&#34; / matte black, it's cheap plastic shiny black the same as the other type of black."
2.0,I would not buy this again. It is too big and bulky. A lot of unnecessary stuff like month dividers and stickers and tabs. I just wanted a pretty lightweight paper weekly planner. Also I wish it came in more patterns. Oh well.
2.0,This product is definitely not sized for adult women.  Fits more for teens
2.0,"I was looking for a lightweight robe to wear in warmer climates/seasons.  The fabric of this robe does meet that expectation, however the sizing was insanely small.  I ordered XL (I’m 5’11” and 180lbs, and typically wear a large or size 12).  The sleeves barely covered my elbows and the length was above my knees.  It seriously wouldn’t have even fit my 12 year old.  It did however wrap around me, so there’s that!"
2.0,"If you are a female with mid to larger sized breast area, this is not for you. Does not adequately cover the chest area and design pelts the material in the middle. Uncomfortable, very thin cheap material that easily rips at the seams! Do not recommend, this claimed it addressed larger sizes...I ordered a large because I wanted more coverage. Not water resistance."
2.0,Is cute but the body gem fell out a couple of months after useage
2.0,Please pay attention to size! These earring are HUGE.  So much bigger than I thought.  They are pretty and have a nice shine to them and look fancy but they are very very very big and heavy.  Definitely not the look I was going for.  If you like a dramatic look and are looking for nice earring then you may like these but just be precautious.  I will be seeking a refund as I don't see myself wearing these.
2.0,Quality is good but it is long and does not shrink!
2.0,its very cute! how ever mine came with a hole in the top right shoulder seam. so will not purchase again.
2.0,Doesn’t fit that good
2.0,fabric was very nice but it just would not stay closed all the way down ... runs too small for a woman with curves ...
2.0,"Cute dress, but the top is sooo small! No bigger than a small B cup if you get the 4-6. It was also very poorly made - while trying to button the top, the snap fell off in my hand within a few seconds."
2.0,"Extremely comfortable. But after about 5 wears, both the grey and the white pair developed ""quarter"" size holes in the bottom area. I had to throw both of them away."
2.0,"Very pretty, but the silver broke between two stones the first time I wore it."
2.0,"Maybe I didn’t read enough into it, but they were a lot smaller than I thought. Had to return them all.."
2.0,Material wasn't nice at all. And Too small.
2.0,The only problem with it is when i hve it on the plastic things in my back and the bck part crumbles up so it looks horrible underneath my shirt if i would have known i would have purchased another brand that the back would not do that.
2.0,Rips and tears.  It didn't last long enough for the money...
2.0,Very uncomfortable.  Sent back..
2.0,"They're not terrible gloves, but the first thing I noticed when I unpackaged them was them smell. I like the smell of leather, but this was a putrid smell embedded in the lining. I tried DOUSING the insides in cologne and that did nothing. Haven't worn them, because I don't want my hands to reek of dead mice and rotten eggs."
2.0,I'm heart broken... They are broken with a hole... i hope I can return and get a new set before halloween... I'll change my review after...<br /><br />edit: I returned but the second pair had the same hole. but I made them work cant wait to add Rose's and beads for a little added flare
2.0,"I found this dress to wear for my wedding shower. Would have been perfect for the 1950's theme. I followed the measurements listed and decided to order the largest possible size, 4xl. And keep in mind, I'm usually in an XL. The dress came in much too small in the bust, and the arms are barely big enough for a child's. I really wanted to love this dress, because the fabric is so soft. But even with adding extra to my measurements to make sure the dress would fit, it came in much too small."
2.0,The picture is very deceiving the hooks are just foam covering a coat hanger and it is very small. My 5 year old said it looks like a zombie mouse. The head is styro-foam and the paint doesn't cover it very well. I was not impressed by this product.
2.0,One of the bands are extremely difficult to put on the watch I’m a little disappointed
2.0,Returned didnt like the pattern in pers oooook n.
2.0,My<br />Kids thought it was comfortable but did not do well after the first wash.  The mask did not hold its shape.
2.0,"These are made of cheap material, you get what you paid for"
2.0,"Cute but not my style, revealing everything freely.<br />Material not to heavy, but could be hot."
2.0,"Great when you first put them on then after just a few minutes, they stretch out way too much just to bunch up in your business and after sweating any amount they remain absolutely soaked. Trashed."
2.0,"I don't think that these are really 50mm lenses.  I got a couple of other &#34;small face&#34; pairs at the same time, and these were by far significantly larger lenses in comparison.  Also the nose support pieces were not lined up correctly.  One was probably 1/8 inch higher than the other, which is a big difference on sunglasses."
2.0,Not impressed.  Old classic durags hold hair down better
2.0,The side ripped after delicate wash and air dry 😔
2.0,Looked terrible on me.  Very frumpy and unflattering. Returned it.
2.0,"Cheaply made and poorly sized. This skirt is not as pretty as pictured, and not even worth $16. The lining material is thin costume material and the tule layer isn’t as thick as pictured. The sizing isn’t very accurate either."
2.0,Runs small I normally wear a large I ordered extra large and it was really tight
2.0,"These would be so much nicer if they were smaller, too big!"
2.0,"I was so excited to get this sweater. The earthy tone in the photo looked perfect for my coloring, and It looked long and flowing. Really, it had a bit of elastic around the bottom and it was a melon color - nothing near what it was in the photo. I returned it and really was disappointed, as it looked so beautiful in the photo."
2.0,Small.  Not worth it.
2.0,"It is really cute, however the size XL sits like a Small/Medium.  I am a size 14 in pants, 5'6 and weight 170.  I ordered the XL and could barely get it on.  It is stretchy, but seriously about 3 to 4 sizes smaller than listed.  It is open in the back, so beware of that, it does show your bra strap.  Also, the sleeves don't stay here as shown.  They move up with your arms.  TO avoid it, you would wear it with the shoulder straps up and it looks like a cowl neck type."
2.0,It bulked up in the back keyhole.
2.0,"Was at least one size too large for me and I ordered a small. The material was a bit transparent so I would have probably worn a slip or nude undergarments at the least. It was an interesting texture of being both a brocade and the print, not sure that I would have kept it based on the fabric alone."
2.0,"I purchased this based off the measurements provided and it’s way too small. I’m usually a size S (4/6) and that’s what I purchased and it was a good couple inches above my knee because it was so tight. Definitely size up - maybe even 2 sizes, depending on how you want it to fit. Otherwise, it looked just like the picture and I was super disappointed it didn’t fit."
2.0,Not really what I expected. Not too crazy about the material.
2.0,Too bulky design
2.0,"I love the shirt, but the front melted in the dryer."
2.0,This was smaller than it said it was. The model in the picture was taller than me and said he wore a medium but I'm 5'8 and it was to short. I got a medium in nike and it fit just right so I thought this would be fine but they were to short.
2.0,"This is a very nice quality gown, but WAY smaller than expected. I normally wear a Medium or Large,  so I ordered X-Large to make it roomy. I couldn't even get it on, it was so narrow! I returned it, and won't order this brand again."
2.0,Horribly made...using it for storing phone cases...smells bad...certainly not a quality leather. Would NOT recommend it at all.
2.0,Thin and floppy.
2.0,Feels a little toy like. Metal isn’t the best.
2.0,"Thought I'd pick these up for a funny gag to support my favorite band, which happens to also be the Hottest Band in the World!  What makes them pretty useless, is that the nose-rest is so narrow that it's impossible to wear unless you have Michael Jackson's super-thin nose.  Fortunately, I don't have MJ's nose, but unfortunately, I can't don these specs for even a minute without them digging into my nose.  Great idea - not so great execution."
2.0,"Unfortunately the second hand fell off the first time I wore it! I had to send it back. It looked to be a great watch, but..."
2.0,Didn't work at all.
2.0,Cheap material don't waste your money
2.0,They are quite thin and don't hold their shape well. There is also a small hole where it apparently came unsewn.
2.0,"Coarse cloth, strange color, fading and dyed my other clothes in washing machine."
2.0,"Disclaimer:  No sheep were harmed in the production of these insoles!<br /><br />When something is advertised as sheepskin, I expect it to be sheepskin.  These inserts are 100% synthetic.  There's no sheep anywhere in the equation.  While the advertising on Amazon is a down-right lie, the plastic sleeves the inserts arrived in make no claims as to their authenticity.<br /><br />With all that in mind, I slipped these inserts into a pair of duck boots that are about a half size too large.  They took up the extra space, and they definitely added a ""snuggle factor"" to those boots as well as some warmth.  I'll keep them, as it's too much of a pain to send them back.<br /><br />It remains to be seen how well these babies hold up.  Sometimes a synthetic is astoundingly durable.  Sometimes it's not.  We'll see."
2.0,Sizes run to small
2.0,"Cute women’s gloves and the medium fit me well. I can wear a thin pair of cotton gloves underneath them. But with or with out the thin cotton gloves, my hands got cold. The gloves will keep my hands warm for a brief time (like running errands) but if you are doing anything outside for a little bit of time, they do not keep your hands warm. I live in Minnesota. I had to shovel and my hands got so cold after about 15-20 minutes that I had to go inside and find my wool mittens. It was only about 10 degrees and the wind was under 10mph so the weather wasn’t extreme. I did not have snow on my gloves either.<br />The wooly cuff is cute but it’s a little too yellow for my tastes. I figured if these kept me warm, I could deal with the yellowish color. But they just are not warm or good at keeping my hands warm."
2.0,"I like em, but one of the stones were off 1 earring"
2.0,"Cons:<br />1. Bought size according to chart. Super tight on butt, thighs, and crotch.  Thought they would rip when I squatted down or lifted my leg. Even in shorts mode.<br />2. Front zipper super short.  Try getting you business out of there in a hurry, if at all. (see photo)<br />3. Knee zippers work but hang up constantly on the fabric when putting back on.<br />4. Tag says they are cotton (see photo).  They are not cotton.<br />5. Top front pockets are useless.  They are located in the very front (not to the side like normal) and are straight across (no angle like normal).  Very hard to use.<br />6. Not stretchy at all.<br />Pros:<br />1. Very light.<br />2. Fit at waist.<br />3. Came with a belt.<br /><br />I sent them back."
2.0,The sizing is small.  The fit is tight.
2.0,The cross would slide all the way down and all of a sudden you got yourself a choker.
2.0,I got this but it was too stiff even after 6 months.
2.0,Terrible. Started to tear on the side seam after 2 wears. Too late to return
2.0,So  so so so small. Size up several sizes. It's also very short in torso.
2.0,"too wide to fit my keys, but it was easy to open"
2.0,Cute socks BUT barely come over calf. By the 10-11th hr of my shift they have been pulled up several times & bunching at the ankle. I'm 5'8&#34;..would be ok for shorter I'm guessing
2.0,fit way too small
2.0,"It’s ok. But the material is cheap, it feels like felt and it fits boxy. Like you’re wearing a felt bag"
2.0,The Jump rings holding the extension are too weak and I have already lost the extender!
2.0,I was pretty disappointed by these... I had high hopes but they barely do anything for you and I felt like I was still squinting the entire time I wore them
2.0,I really expected them to be rose gold or pinkish like the pictures but they were much more yellow. Had to send back.
2.0,"This dress is a blatant copy of dresses made by Zesica. Same design and fabric, the difference is that this one does not fit well, and is very poorly made. Spend the extra $10 and get the beautiful original instead."
2.0,"If you have the &#34;thick hair&#34; hair elastics, this won't work, it's too small for them."
2.0,"Dress fit great, super comfy and I loved the pockets. But I ordered the dark green and I got more of a teal. Wouldnt really be that big a deal but I needed it for a wedding color. If you need a  green, this wont work."
2.0,The waist is one of those huge elastics and the scrunch bum feels scratchy. I would not buy again. They do fit perfectly but I never wear them. I want to be comfortable AND look cute.
2.0,not very breathable. i'm a size 5.5 and these are a little too tight and small
2.0,These socks do not look like the image when they come in. They are much smaller in size and the image quality is terrible. The black color bleeds over into the yellow. They look very cheaply made. Only gave another star because they’re socks and they’re functional. Just not good quality.
2.0,The pants were cute and very comfortable but the very first day I wore them I noticed the rear seam was completely coming undone.
2.0,"It's ok for a around the house top.  The red is not as red, the collar of the shirt could be better made, and really not worth the price for the quality."
2.0,"Beautiful but breaks quickly. Worn it once and when i washed it, it broke already"
2.0,Not true to size.  They run very small.
2.0,"I’ve used the gloves for 2 seasons. They are warm down to 20 degrees F but fingertips got cold when the temps were in the teens. My biggest complaint is that my gloves are NOT WATERPROOF. Not. Close. I ski in the sierras in NorCal and the snow is frequently wet. I’m not talking about rain - but the snow is going to get you wet if you don’t have waterproof gear. These gloves are wet through to the skin within an hour. If you need gloves that are waterproof, I’d look elsewhere."
2.0,runs very small and certainly would not say they are high waisted. Deep pockets are good
2.0,Loved the color and style of this blouse.i usually wear a large but ordered extra large plus n it was to tight in the arms.And had a small blaxk spot on it
2.0,"Sole fell apart after the 3rd use, I had to use super glue to keep them together until my sons new shoes arrive."
2.0,"They are quite large...larger than needed.  But they are basically going to be a one-time wear since the adhesive was pulling off after one short use.  I've worn many different adhesive bras, and this is the only one that started peeling off the adhesive this quickly."
2.0,"The skirt didn’t have holes for the buttons. I had to cut holes into it. It was ok, not great."
2.0,The collar was sewn on crooked (did not meet in middle) and the buttons did not reach as far down as expected. The waist line/bust line was sort of high and did not fit well (that's not usually the case for me).
2.0,The chain broke after only a little wear by my wife. It's a very thin chain.
2.0,This was not a good quality product for the price. Ended up returning
2.0,"The mask is too big and as in the photo, right in the middle of the cat’s head something must have been lying on the material because it has a white squiggly pattern."
2.0,"I bought these to wear on a trip to South Florida in Feb. thinking they would be heavy enough for cool nights but light enough during the day. The product does not match the picture at all. The khaki color is more burnt Orange than anything. The relaxed look of the fabric is nonexistent, so far no amount of washing has produced a less “95% polyester” look and feel. The fabric is not soft but it is VERY billowy in the fit. I ordered a Medium and my husband immediately said they look like MC Hammer pants from the 90s."
2.0,Jawbone falls out!
2.0,"These are cute and seem to be well made. However, after wearing them for a couple of hours, my piercings started to itch, and I had some irritation. The beading is pretty, and being quite a substantial earring, arrive in an adorable little gold bag.<br /><br />I’m just a little suspicious when it comes to the metal content of the wires and cannot find any information on the web page or product. Too bad, as they are attractive, but I can’t wear them."
2.0,"Cute design, but the materials and quality are very cheaply done. I found t hat the material was a bit 'itchy' which makes it pretty uncomfortable. It does hold up well being washed in the washing machine, though."
2.0,"I gave this product a two star rating. One for the material. The other for the function. Had I not destroyed the box, it would have been returned. It was way to bulky to carry on its own, and didn't have a strap. This really seems to be for a larger phone also. My 5s swam in the compartment used for the phone.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"Hard to breathe in. There seem to be 2 layers, and the inner layer pulls up into your nose as you breathe, making it difficult and uncomfortable."
2.0,"These are not good wicking socks. I need good wicking socks for when I wear boots in the winter. My feet get very moist and I usually have to change my socks half way through the day. When I wear these socks, my feet themselves don't really feel wet, but I can tell that the socks are wet from absorption and then my feet get really cold from the moist socks. Disappointing considering how pricey they are."
2.0,The set I purchased was huge. Absolutely not newborn or infant sized. My 9 year old can wear these.
2.0,Love everything about this coat but the zipper. It’s warm and fits great. The zipper on the other hand is garbage. I’ve had this coat for 4 days and it keeps popping open from the bottom and then unzips from the bottom up. If they would have just used a fully metal zipper this problem could be completely avoided. Very disappointed.
2.0,Fair warning they're huge. I didn't realize how big They were until they came in. They get caught on everything and hurt to sleep in.
2.0,"Like the color &  the feel.  Large, my usual size, was waaaaay too small.  Gave it to a friend and ordered an XXL.  Fits just fine."
2.0,Way too large to normal fit
2.0,Very thin and bendable metal. Not thick surgical steel. Mine was bent and uneven and needed adjusting. Not what I was looking for but very pretty.
2.0,couldnt wear gave away........had design on back also<br />between missing orders and this doubt I will order any more clothes from amazon
2.0,"I ordered at least 5 Grace Karin vintage dresses, returning two as it turned out too large for me.  Fabric may need ironing.  Loose on the top, shoulders, chest, arms, and waist line.  I ordered a small and it is still too large :(  Returning two keeping three."
2.0,Unfortunately the hairs all fall off. I have to return it.
2.0,Glue was visible all around the heel of the shoe.
2.0,The charm doesn’t fit necklaces that have a claw. I bought 100 rope necklaces and 100 charms. No good.
2.0,This watch is cute but doesn’t charge properly. Can’t get it to plug into charger at all now.
2.0,"The backing is weak and the insert that goes through the earlobe is a bit flimsy. The backing fell off, I am guessing it does not have a good slit to grasp on. They are cute, though but I cannot really wear them."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:fb6ee99ce6ef0e4b22915671f35f3795]] Its the same exact item
2.0,They leak water into my eyes.  I don't like them or use them.
2.0,"These are really cute, so I'll keep them, but I wouldn't buy them again, nor would I recommend them.  The post that goes through your ear is extremely poor quality and bent the first time I put them in.  Luckily they didn't break off, so I'll just be really careful when wearing them.  There are other similar ones out there that are better quality."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these.  They are constructed well with a sturdy, slip-proof lug sole and are an attractive option for a rain boot.  The problem is that they are an awkward fit.  Despite the elastic insert, the narrow shaft makes it difficult to wedge your foot into the boot without bunching your socks. Then the boot is tight across the toes (or maybe that's just the bunched sock?) and instep, but the heel is wide so there's movement/friction in heel area. I would have severe blisters if I wore these for any amount of time.<br />So two stars for the quality of construction, but minus three stars for the painful fit."
2.0,I thought it would be a little sexier but it was very conservative looking.
2.0,This one is not polarized. Disappointed. I bought three others glasses 2 brown and 1 black and they all polarized
2.0,"The one I received was not like the one in the picture, kind of poor workmanship."
2.0,a little shiny. not to fond of the quality.
2.0,One of the numbers tore off because the numbers are flimsy.  My son liked it but it only lasted a week or two.
2.0,"lasted 2 months, then broke"
2.0,"quite sturdy! that's what I was looking for. My other EO bracelets lifetime days are numbered due to terpenes in the oils. I thought this would do the trick. It certainly does! So much so, that even I can't get it open! Box is lovely, though."
2.0,I ordered these after seeing a bunch of good reviews. They feel much cheaper than I was expecting- not terrible for the price but I was expecting better.
2.0,Runs So small I had to return it.
2.0,I hoped different view in physical but I helped in any case.<br /><br />Best regards.
2.0,"They say it is for youth but is large on adult.<br />I bought to my son, but he needs wait more 2 years for wear it."
2.0,Too small and poor quality.  I returned for refund
2.0,Very odd cut. Has a weird pleat in the middle of the shirt. Different textures and not flattering at all
2.0,La tela casi no tiene espandex y da mucho calor....es 100% poliester
2.0,2stars because it said butt lifting. Done of these legging do that. I bought it because the texture is different. Also the waist seems like its 4&quot; elastic but its not. Inside it has a 1&quot; elastic band. Which its made cheap. But 5 stars on the material(just because its different). Bought a medium the scrunch butt isnt that noticeable so it doesnt ENHANCE your butt that much.
2.0,Cheaper than it looked in the picture when I got it. I had a barbell with the same material and gems just know the gems will be falling off soon.
2.0,"It's ok. Pretty, but not exactly what I wanted"
2.0,Please note the bottoms are “one size fits all” they are stretchy...... but not that much. I do not recommend for thic or curvy girls. I wear a size 10 bottoms and could not get them all the way up my legs smh. The colors and style are sure cute
2.0,This is both poorly made and unflattering for my pear figure.
2.0,I ordered a larger size as I have been to make sure it fits. It was really big but cute.
2.0,The color I was looking for Was a mustard like the picture it wasn’t a horrible outfit I’ll use it as a sweater.
2.0,"I followed the size chart in the description, and it was still too big by at least one size.  I'm just going to return it.  I gave it two stars because I at least would have kept it if it had fit."
2.0,"One belt is still holding together, the other buckle sort of exploded after a few weeks. Held together with pressed pins by friction, not screws. Only a matter of time before the other one breaks."
2.0,It's OK.  I really like the size and the compartments.  The color I purchased is beige but in certain lighting it looks more pink/salmon and I don't like that.  It also looks a little cheap.  I kept it because I had already returned a number of other bags so I thought I should settle on this one.
2.0,This dress is beautiful...love everything about it!  Just wish that it was not an irregular.  Package from the product is labeled as an irregular but I don't remember seeing that in the product description.  The shell bodice was sewn into the mesh crooked.  Sending it back.  :(  sad face.
2.0,Runs big.  I would recommend buying a size down.  Didn’t care for the fit.  More like a long sleeve t-shirt than a sweatshirt.
2.0,"The picture shows a nice looking bush style hat with a nicely shaped brim and crown. Unfortunately what you'll receive is a wrinkled mess that looks nothing like the picture. The crown is so high it looks goofy as well. It just looks like a poorly designed bookie hat. Does not look like an Australian style bush hat - which is what I was expecting based on the pics. Also, I have a small (7 1/8), completely shaved head and it fits me tightly. I can't inmagine anyone with a larger head being able to wear this."
2.0,The robe is pretty.  SUPER disappointed that there was not a sash/belt included!  There is not a way to tie the robe.
2.0,They are soft and could possibly be comfortable but they are too tight.
2.0,"The ring is styled nicely, except the the add was misleading. The ring was advertised as stainless steel. This ring is actually brass with a gold plating. The plating will eventually wear off. I will not ever wear the ring."
2.0,The front tie is weird and looks ugly.
2.0,Completely see through. But...they fit as expected.
2.0,"I love this shirt, but when I washed it, it looked like the creases from where it was folded left fuzzy lines, like lint gathered there, but it was the fabric not lint, or a snag happened, but the reverse side showed no snag. It was washed with in cold on delicate and laid flat to dry, as per washing instructions. If it weren't for that, this shirt is great."
2.0,"The style was good enough, but unfortunately it arrived wrinkled and it was impossible to get those wrinkles out. Had to return it."
2.0,So incredibly small and uncomfortable. I had to do some serious cutting before it was even wearable and still was painful. Not made for adult humans
2.0,"The padding in these shorts is not subtle, that's for sure. If you plan to bike somewhere and not walk around at all before you change they might work, but unlike some padded shorts the padding is huge. I didn't find them that comfortable to bike in either, the padding moves around."
2.0,"I loved this necklace, it was super cute and I like never took it off, but I was taking it off the other day and the clasp broke :( I will try to repair it, but until then I am very dissatisfied with this purchase."
2.0,scarfs aren’t satin they’re polyester
2.0,"Not satisfied with its size or quality. The pockets for the cards are too small and make it hard to pull your cards and license out. The zipper fell off while using it so I had to put it back on which was a pain. The snaps to keep it closed don't fit so it doesn't actually clip shut, the snaps just catch each other so you think they're clipped. It serves it's purpose well enough but I would not recommend anyone to buy it."
2.0,The design is very blurred and you cannot tell what it’s actually supposed to be as it looks in the picture.  Poor image usage
2.0,fabric too thin.
2.0,Very nice fabric but too thin. And the sizes run very tight on the torso.
2.0,I’m not too big and the neck about chokes me.
2.0,"the watch band is not genuine leather, it feels like plastic. It already tore and I have had it three days. The return isnt even worth it, but I am definitely buying a different brand."
2.0,The shoes rubbed the back of my granddaughters heal all the time and she’s only 2 and can talk well and she continued to tell her mom “ her feet hurt” and would tKe the shoe off and rub her heels.
2.0,Wig started to fall apart after wearing it twice.
2.0,started turning after wearing twice
2.0,It is good quality but I wish they had small size in it. I ordered smallest size but still it was big for me to wear.
2.0,I brought a xlg and it fitted like a med
2.0,Arm holes are weirdly cut out. Shirts have a very plastic like feel. Would not recommend.
2.0,Ummmmm how are we supposed to get it over our heads? And not choke?? Lol seriously it’s cute but the hood is small and the neck part as well🤷🏾‍♀️ Will be returning being that we can’t get it over our head..
2.0,"The one positive is that the blazer does look the way it’s shown in photos. However, it is falling apart just coming out of the package! The material is falling apart, threads are hanging off, the fabric is thin and itchy, size XS is like a medium, the arms are huge, it’s floppy and not holding shape...  I will return this right away before it completely unravels and can’t be returned at all."
2.0,These are very cheaply made. They roll around the edges and won't stay up like they are supposed to.
2.0,Subparr quality. Looks cheap.
2.0,I paid $25 for this and it had an $11price tag on it from the Store.
2.0,"I had bought these before so I went back to my original order and clicked purchase again. When I received these they looked just like the original ones I bought except for these lenses were the super dark ones, which I did not select. They are so dark you can barely see out of them."
2.0,Too small and bad quality
2.0,They were pretty...but the prongs holding the center stone were sharp and stuck out. Wouldn't buy again!
2.0,Really loved the colors but disappointed in how it washed in cold water.
2.0,Would love them if they were true to size. They came packaged in two three packs. One pack was a true medium. The other pack fit like a large but the tag said medium. I would've returned them had I not washed them and assumed they would fit.
2.0,Doesn't hold up for everyday use
2.0,returned.....way too big
2.0,"Not a true to size...too big,loose fit"
2.0,They did not fit as tightly as I had hoped and are too short to wear to yoga. They are comfortable to wear around the house and for bed.
2.0,ok for non leather. For the price it is fine
2.0,"was a bit small, sent it back"
2.0,"This is my second time submitting this review, I am not sure why it was rejected originally. Shoes are ok, a little snug and I ordered per the size chart listed. The major issue I had is that they sent the wrong color and now I have to make the trip to return them. They didn’t even get close to the correct ones. I ordered black and received white and blue."
2.0,Very thin! I was expecting a scarf that keeps you warn. This is not what I wanted. Very disappointed.
2.0,Thin material and is by far not a sweater... Made of cotton lol.. Not worth it.
2.0,Too small. I was not impressed.
2.0,"These are beautiful, but I find them a bit bulky. I will most likely gift them to other people. As I like a more sleek look with my Apple Watch."
2.0,These were way too small for my 10 yr old.
2.0,"The product description says watch is 7.68&#34; long, however the one I received was only 7.14&#34; long with the two extra links already put on so it doesn't fit me. Seller told me to give it to someone else or return it. Not happy."
2.0,Had to send these back.  They were wicked tarnished and nothing I did to shine them up did a bit of good.
2.0,"These fit uncomfortably small. Most of the reviews said the size chart was accurate so I ordered a medium and they fit like a small, bordering on extra small.<br /><br />Two stars because they arrived three days early."
2.0,"These pants fit, but they lay in a kind of awkward way. The color is ugly. I'm just not really a fan of them."
2.0,Not good for sensitive skin. Silver color wears off.
2.0,"Although the style is nice, these glassy are very flimsy.<br />My son wants a new pair - is actually begging for them.<br />However, I'm afraid to spend the money (again) because I've already purchased two pairs and they both have broken (with very little &#34;effort&#34;)."
2.0,"Very disappointed this shirt runs really small. If ordering, consider ordering 2 sizes up."
2.0,Very small.  Beads are small size.  Looks like a women's bracelet.
2.0,"Fabric is scratchy, maybe will soften up in wash. I was expecting bigger (more fabric) for being ""over sized"" I'm 5'5 (145lbs) and it barely comes down to my hips in the large size.  Material is slightly on the thinner side, as you can clearly see in the attached my black tank shows right through it. The sleeves are not as clingy as they look in the seller's pictures which means the whole thing looks a little sloppy. At current I'm debating on returning it. It's not what I expected but it's not entirely terrible either."
2.0,Was hoping this product would fit...just a bit snug. Go with a size or two bigger.
2.0,"Did a return they did approved it. But when I went to the Post Office to Mail it back. I have to pay $27 something which the item comes up to about $30 something. So I'm losing money, it's not even returne."
2.0,"I’m kinda super sad. I had ordered the shorter shorts and absolutely love them so then I ordered the longer ones and they do not fit! No room for any butt and doesn’t go even near mid waist. There’s also a loose elastic band that rolls when getting them on. I’m crazy bummed that they aren’t even near the same. I have hips, booty and thighs but large fits me well with all bottoms. Not sure what happened here."
2.0,The arms of the jacket are very tight and stiff other than that it fits as expected
2.0,So disappointed.  This is not a tunic! The colors are beautiful. That’s the only reason I gave it two stars.
2.0,The dress itself was fine but this dress is not made for larger busts. I wear a 32K and have a 10+ inch difference between bust and waist and this did not fit at all. I ordered according to size chart. I'm shocked it's worked so well for others - maybe quality control is the problem?
2.0,It runs really big. Not a fan
2.0,They are nice but the texture is not my favorite. I thought they were from another texture.
2.0,Top is giant and bottom is tiny
2.0,They run so small. I got a 38 to be safe and they didn't fit. And returning things on line is a pain in the butt.
2.0,These are comfy but are really see through and thin
2.0,This shirt is not as long as the picture shows. It's really short and not flattering. I also hate how the stripes don't match up from front to back.  Returning
2.0,"Not comfortable, make you sweat"
2.0,"Metal color rubs off to reveal it is a plastic like material and left green marks on my skin.  As long as you never let your arm get moist, it will be ok.  Shortening the link is a little cumbersome but doable."
2.0,Very patriotic!
2.0,This dress does not fit like I expected it to. It does NOT look like it does on the model online.....
2.0,"The details on the top are nice and elegant. However, it provides very little support to your breast-which a woman with a little sag might need. Then the thong. Yes, the thong is so cheap and large that I didn't even wear it to showcase this to my man. Overal, it's sexy as it's plenty see through but the quality-especially the thong-is on the low side.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,"This dress is much more straight and snug fitting than the picture shows. I ordered the blue one and the color is true to the photo. The fabric is sturdy. I am 5.4 and i bought the size large, it's too long, it reaches my knees. If I tried on at the store I would not have bought it. Too long too snug and too straight not swingy like the picture."
2.0,smaller than description indicated.
2.0,I did not like these. You get what you pay for-The larger ones stick out way too far. Don't waste your money
2.0,"Ok, so the headline I think says it all.  Where do I start.  I read the reviews, so I bought a size bigger, it was still too small for me. What I thought I was going to like, was the way it fastened in the back, thought it would be very supporting, but it does take some wacky moves to get into it, then the cups are really oddly shaped, it's not at all flattering under a jogging top, was not looking for flattering, but I don't want to look deformed either. Sorry"
2.0,"Did not like these “Kosy Komfort” socks/shoe liners as they were definitely not cosy or comfortable. The elastic stitching around the top was too thick and when wearing shoes it would leave itchy red marks. The sock material itself was scratchy and rough (even after laundering) and left my feet itchy and irritated. There was enough fabric in the toe area to keep the socks in place, but not in the heel. Even with the slicone grips on the inside of the heel fabric, I was constantly having to pull these back up over my heel as they’d continually slip off every few steps. Didn’t matter what style of shoes I wore them with - slip-ons or sneakers. I give them two stars because they are indeed no-show with summery low cut slip-on shoes, which is what I was looking for, but the missing comfort and quality put these in the ‘loss’ category."
2.0,"Well I am pretty disappointed with this product, It fits nice the color is really nice, however the magnet seems pretty strong on it to hold it still however, it slides A LOT and becomes very loose very quick I used it for about 4 hours and in that 4 hours i had to readjust the metal about 500 times. I had to keep tightening it. And it pulled pretty much all of my hair out. Super disappointed in this. :( I gave 2 stars for color and fit. Other than that i don't think it needs any more stars.<br /><br />Would I buy again? = no<br />Would I recommend to family and friends? = no<br /><br />I received this for a discount in exchange for my honest review. In writing an honest review, I am not paid to give only positive thoughts on the product. I am just reviewing the product. I will be offering my true thoughts on the product, my positives and negatives.<br /><br />If you found this helpful please vote yes, Thank you<br /><br />My star rating also reflects on the items price ( how well it is crafted and how the item functions). If the item is cheap but still does what I would aspect at the price its being sold for I give it the rating that is fair for the price, not compared to a higher or lower priced item.<br /><br />Star ratings:<br />5 Stars: Loved The Product<br />4 Stars Liked The Product<br />3 Stars Okay Product<br />2 Stars Dislike Product<br />1 Star Hated Product"
2.0,The only reason I gave the rating I did was because it didn't work with my garage door opener.  The video they provided didn't help either.
2.0,They were too tight for wider fwet and did not stretch to accomodate.
2.0,"It's very pretty however it game broken in the box and my husband had to put it back together for me with pliers. It is also quite heavy. But all in all, it looks exactly like the picture."
2.0,"Nice fabric, but makes a very full and heavy skirt. Did not like the way it hangs on me with the scoop. Returned with no problem. Looked cute on the model though!"
2.0,"First of all,  The top doesn’t look good or fit unless you have some under boob hanging out.  So I paired the bottoms with a different bikini top I had.  I received many complements the first two times I wore it. But all of the metallic sheds. It may be because I went in the ocean instead of a pool.  I had to throw these bottoms away.<br /> If you just intend to lay poolside, these are the bottoms for you. If you intend to swim at all, don’t purchase these.<br /> It also took forever to get all of the straps looking nice  and well separated on my thighs."
2.0,Looked cheap!
2.0,"This is not an off the shoulder top.....it’s crew neck and more of a muscle tee....it’s good quality, a little thick for my taste and olive green is a nice color but I was looking for the style in the pic so I’ll be returning."
2.0,i didnt really know that it was made for men.... while it does say it in the add... i thought that was the style of it... its too big for my wrist .. i gave it away
2.0,"If it comes in print, would be alot better. Material is good just when the luggage gets on to the belt at airport, rolling and sliding luggage makes it gets dirty too fast"
2.0,"Had it one week and coming apart already on the inside, I only carry my wallet and cell in it so wasn't to heavy by all means. Looks really nice on the outside and the color is perfect, it's big with lots of pockets which I like but doesn't do me no good if it's falling apart already. Wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"It's bigger than the table's size reference, the cloth it isn't soft, the fabric is thick and hard"
2.0,Great shirt but runs SUPER small! I ordered a men’s medium and it’s really like a small.
2.0,"It's just not for me.  A size small did loosely fit me (5'4, 117lbs, 32D), but I didn't like the neckline or fabric. It has a weird sheen to it.  Returned."
2.0,"beautiful, but..and it's a big &#34;but&#34; the crotch came apart (tore) on the second wearing. I tried to sew, but the fabric is very delicate. This area should be reinforced."
2.0,"Cuts between toes. Feels flimsy and they did not cut off the extra cast material.  Super light, does not feel like it will protect your feet from the shower to​ the car and home."
2.0,Not real Aventurine.
2.0,"Could not wait to get these, now that I have them they are not full length leggings they stop at the mid- calf. The black on the top end is more charcoal grey then the actual black on my legs, so the digital print gets distorted. Thought these were going to be too small but they do fit me, woman's size 4-6. They are a silky feel but I don't see them lasting but a few wears and they will need boot cuffs to make up for the leg length or knee high to mid calf  boots."
2.0,"These are helpful, but they don't have compression zippers. I would recommend a set with compression zippers instead."
2.0,These are very flimsy and run small
2.0,"Very Cute dress... but Wayyyyyy too small. I can wear a small or even xs sometimes and it was literally choking me. I am pretty petite, 5’1 130lbs and small chested. I ordered a small and it was way too small. Would recommend sizing up one if not two sizes as the neck and waist are very tight."
2.0,I thought it would be a bit thicker....
2.0,Arrived quickly but that is the best thing I can say.  The bracelet had no quality control.  The eyes were not all over the beads...not centered...smeared looking.  Very disappointed.  Would have sent it back but it would not be worth the postage.
2.0,"Too stiff, not soft.  I returned this item."
2.0,Cute suit but the sizing was way off.. I returned it
2.0,The mask looked great with the lights on.<br /><br />It was a really thin material...& a little flimsy....kids will break this in minutes...lol.
2.0,"color much stronger than I expected, the sweater doesn't have much form, so at best i may wear it at home."
2.0,Dislike/ Too small
2.0,very bery basic- size does run large - but I could pick up the same thing at Walmart
2.0,it does not hold its shape
2.0,"something about this material also starts to smell after a while, other masks don't do this."
2.0,I ordered two different shirts and I got two of the same one.
2.0,"Pairing process was fine, the problem with these is you practically have to be in the garage for the door to operate.  I'd be in my car 5-10 feet directly in front of my garage door and have to press the button 5-7 times to finally get the door to open or close.  Very frustrating. Tried new batteries and opening my car window, still don't work.  I also adjusted the antenna on the garage unit itself which did not help. Both remotes work the same.  Now the button on one remote is ""squishy"" and no longer clicks, probably due to me having to press it so many times.  Found a good option at Home Depot and my new remote works Great!!"
2.0,"The beads are a light blue, not even remotely the emerald green shown in the product image."
2.0,Very short....
2.0,"It works and looks stylish. The price is fairly decent as well. My only problem is the awful band snapping design. I needed a utensil (which they actually provide) to change the band length and it took me needing to youtube it to find out how. Taking it off is also a issue for me, I always feel like I will break the watch if I'm too forceful. Maybe I'm not doing this right, but I don't think attaching / adjusting a wristband's strap should be complicated."
2.0,This bras run small and quality is not good
2.0,Great value compared to others .<br />But they don’t always have the quantity stated<br /><br />Ahhhh
2.0,Earring arrived broken
2.0,"poor quality... shiny, see thru halloween material... does not fit as on the picture... :-/"
2.0,"What came was not the coloring I ordered. Other than that, it’s cute and great for a swim suit/beach day."
2.0,To tiny no in space
2.0,"I have been wearing Coobie bras for about 3 years and have 2 other strapless bandeau's that stay up, no tugging or pulling. This one must be defective, I tried to wear it  (I wear a 36d and never have I had them not stay up)and by the time I* got into the car it had already slipped down and around my waist! I had to wear a sweater over my dress because I had to take it off. It could have been embarrassing (more so than wearing a cardigan over a strapless maxi dress)if it had slipped down w/o the sweater on.  The pricing isn't any cheaper than the coobie website when they have promos but I needed this right away so I paid for it and 3 other items."
2.0,"I like the fabric this is made of, but the ruffle along with the elephant design pattern makes me look really heavy and wide.  Not at all flattering.  I normally wear a size 10 and most people guess me to weigh 10 to 20 lbs less than I actually do, so I don't believe I really look this wide normally.  My husband is the one who said it made me look wide as I couldn't tell from the half mirror I was looking in.  Not a good fit for me, I like a more flattering fit."
2.0,"These were received promptly and were a gift for my 9 yr old grandson. I ordered size 10. They were happily received but the top was tried on immediately and fit like a size 6 or 8! I returned them for a 12. The top on the 12s just fit and will be outgrown within the year, but my grandson loved them."
2.0,"My baby mama tried the dress on after four days of receiving it. It was originally a mother's day gift. She did not fit the dress because the measurements were suited for an Asian woman.  I tell you, designers like jiujiuyi should come to America, and collaborate with designers who are already here to actually see how shapely and gorgeous our ladies are. I think Michelle O. can fit an Asian 2X, and she is a slim lady with sporty curves.<br /><br />I truly say, if you are going to sell womens clothes here, they better know the intimate details of the average American woman."
2.0,"Cute top but it runs a little small. I wear a size 12 and usually a large fits. This large is a little snug. The color is NOT navy, it's actually a cobalt blue 😑<br /><br />**Update ** I exchanged the large for an extra large and it fits better but fit is snug. I love the style so  I hang it to dry and stretch it a little."
2.0,Looks very dull. Hard to screw and unscrew.
2.0,"The description doesn't address this but the top is very sheer. As a pus size gal I would not be comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. It fit well, although since I am very short, it was long on me - it fell to almost the top of my thigh."
2.0,"The ""opal"" is just awful! Not at all like the picture. It's a weird shaped ""stone"". Not any shape you'd see in a ring. And it looks like it's made of plastic or something. Just not cheap but oddball & visibly off. But for what I paid...I shoulda known. **Update- and by the beginning of 2023 the stone fell out of its setting!"
2.0,"Not sure if I received just the outer shell, there are no tags and it seems like it could use a liner. I will be returning this"
2.0,Very cute but broke after a week.
2.0,This is a very poor quality blazer. One layer of fabric so it hangs like a long sleeve tee shirt. Not keeping this item.
2.0,I’m disappointed with these eyeglass straps because they are not at all easy to attach. They are too long for a preschool aged head. They are poorly finished with fraying edges.  I do not recommend them.
2.0,"The design and appearance is really nice. It is comfortable, and easy to get on and off. It fits my Apple Watch well. However, after wearing it for about a month, the finish on the underside is starting to wear off.  Disappointing."
2.0,This shirt was way too small and I sent it back for refund
2.0,Its heavy and the backing needs additional support. I got the 7mm.  Seems like the rose gold color will fade fast. Not impressed.
2.0,"These goggles offer a wide range of vision underneath the water and were wonderful the first few uses. However, the plastic became stretched and no longer tight and also suction was gone, which worsened any time water got in as the plastic area became wet and completely did not seal. I am very disappointed as I loved the wide-viewing frame."
2.0,Not properly made.
2.0,Returning immediately.  I ordered a size 9 and it is the same size as my daughter's old size 7 boots.  Be advised to order at least 2 sizes up.
2.0,Beautiful bracelet but extremely light weight.
2.0,This is not fixed and keeps being taken down. But quality is not bad.
2.0,Very nice jewelry. Price went up $50 for Christmas. What a sleezy practice. You've lost a customer forever. I would return the thing if my gf didn't like it.
2.0,"Fun for kids, cute. Not adjustable"
2.0,These luggage straps are of no use because the plastic clip is not strong enough to allow the strap to be pulled tight.  One clip broke altogether.  The other clips pull apart.  I will return this item to the vendor.
2.0,Material was to light and transparent.  I like the style but not for me.
2.0,This has been worn for probably a month and the seams are already split. This is way too small for my 9 year old.
2.0,First of all these run very big. The worst thing is the material they’re made of! I washed them before wearing and there was so much lint it was over flowing the lint catcher. I had to empty it twice! I have never seen that happen in my life. I haven’t worn them yet because of the material.  Don’t know that I will. Buy another brand!
2.0,"I wear exactly a 7.5 shoe size, and have never had issues ordering shoes online... These would fit fine if the edges on the heel and by the toes didn't dig into my skin. Especially on the heel. I would just pay the extra money and get a nicer pair, or get a cheap pair in person."
2.0,Did not enjoy the fit as for anyone with breaststroke larger than a c cup can't make look like I borrowed my little sister's baby doll dress.  This also was too sheer and will require me to add a camisole layer.  Too hot in summer for layers.
2.0,"They are dark and that is good, but they broke. I hardly used them."
2.0,Be aware it is only one
2.0,Smaller than expected.<br />Good for a young child.
2.0,These did not fit well at all. They were see-through and they were tight in the wrong places. The band is small and does not flatter your tummy in any way. I definitely would not be able to work out in them but they wouldn’t even make very good leggings just to wear around the house.
2.0,Not able to ware it
2.0,My hands are small and wide. The fingers on these gloves were too long even though the fit around my hand was perfect.
2.0,Quality inferior...returned
2.0,both jackets purchased were way too small and had ordered larger than thought needed. good jacket but sizes are way off
2.0,"These pants look great, but waist is super duper tight, so much so I can't wear them for more than a couple hours. The pocket works well. I was surprised at how warm they are."
2.0,really fake looking up close i think i can get away with it but they will rust if you get water on them
2.0,It looks very very cheep sad to say but i guess its worth the price.
2.0,"So small! I just gave it to my little sister. I should have anticipated it though, because my chest is always larger than a small. However, the bottoms felt great."
2.0,"Sleeves and neck were huge. Body of shirt was equivalent to an XL. The pockets are placed too high and add bulk vs use. Material was itchy, not smooth like a typical sun shirt."
2.0,These were super cute for my boyfriend and I. However after a month they just start to fall apart.
2.0,"I find this to be &#34;just OK&#34; in terms of costume-ish jewelry. It really bugs me that the &#34;turquoise&#34; (NOT authentic as incorrectly reported in the above Answered Question...) is NOT graduated evenly: one side is laid out more straight and nicely uniform, whereas the other lies at an angle. Pictures #1 and #5 in the slide show are accurate representations of what I received.<br /><br />If you're slightly OCD and/or big on symmetry, you might want to skip it. I'm debating whether or not it's worth my time to send it back, as I paid about 15% of the listed price."
2.0,To small nowhere near the size ordered.  To short like a skirt for a kid. Gave it away.  Ordered it for an event.
2.0,Ankle and wrist bands snapped
2.0,Size was too small. Size was not as indicated
2.0,Nice fabric. However these are half shirts (midriff) and not nearly long enough to wear alone as a summer tank. Could never consider being able to tuck them in as they barely cover my naval.
2.0,"The screen I ordered these shorts from just listed the sizes up to 5x with no indication that the sizes were Asian, not U.S. standard. As a big guy, I ordered 5x, my usual size. One look at these shorts when they arrived and I knew they wouldn't fit me. It was then I went to the home page of this product only to find out that 5x in Asian sizes is actually XL in U.S. sizes. So on that score alone, this product is unusable for me.<br /><br />There's more though. Take a closer look at the photos of these shorts on the product page. The zippered pockets are presumably meant to have a racing stripe, a sporty effect. On the actual shorts though, the zippers look tacky and cheap, as though one hard tug would rip them right off. The little white circles around the drawstrings look like cheap, paste on decals. The metal tips on the end of the drawstrings also look shoddy and seem like they will fall off fairly quickly. Even if these shorts had fit me, I would not have been happy with them and would have expected them to fall apart fairly quickly. Two stars is actually being generous to this shabby product."
2.0,"Bummer, bought 3t along with other pajamas that were 3t.  These were almost 2 sizes smaller....disappointed as it was a Christmas gift.  Material is thin, would not recommend."
2.0,"Not sure if this is some sort of joke, or a fashion trend I've not caught onto, but it sure is small. Tiny. &#34;Holds everything you need and nothing more.&#34; Not in my case. Driver license, three credit cards and there's a key pocket that might allow one key comfortably. Did I mention it's tiny? It's not worth sending back since I got it at a discount, but I won't use it."
2.0,"Though I love the shape, weight and size of these, I was disappointed that I had received two different earrings. One was a dark wood and one was a lighter wood. They are fairly simple to put in. If you have patience. I do believe that one size fits all. They are such a statement. And are definitely unique. I love that they were organic."
2.0,"The look of the glasses are fine, but the lens popped out before I even had the chance to wear the."
2.0,"So- so.  Clearly plastic even from a distance.  Still for the price it holds my ebook and phone, glasses, etc., and the plastic makes it right for a crappy weather day."
2.0,"This shirt is super cute and the fabric is very soft but the sizing is wayyyy off. I'm returning for a refund and unfortunately, they don't go any smaller than a Small."
2.0,"Didn't fit as depicted, much more revealing in person. Also stretched out very easily."
2.0,Loved it but only wore it once and it fell apart.
2.0,Received 2 different size feet.
2.0,It was a lot thinner than I thought it was going to be I was scared to wear it for long periods of time and I brushed my hair and it broke so easily now I have no chain for my charm and for what I paid for it I wish it was stronger and thicker
2.0,Handle started to peel after a month of use
2.0,"Feels very cheap and wont last long. I was expecting a better, more solid piece of jewelry."
2.0,"Super super high, I know the pic is with boots but like you can’t wear them without a TALL boots. With my doc martens they are still short and come like to my lower calf but no where near my ankle. Such a good fit to stop so short. I’m 5’5” 170. I bought a size 12.could have been better as a bigger size but I doubt it. Snug fit anyway."
2.0,I love the way the bracelets looked but they don’t last at all. Wish I could get my money back since one of them broke 2 days after it was delivered.
2.0,"I was really looking forward to getting this gown. Unfortunately, the bust was huge yet the cups were too close together. The body was so tight that every bump and roll showed. Unless you have a perfect figure and a large bust, I don't recommend this gown."
2.0,"Sizing is inconsistent. The first dress I ordered fit great. The next two were labeled as smalls, and they were three times the size of the first one I received. I had to return them."
2.0,Colors are neon-ish.....bleh  wanted softer toned coloring
2.0,"I ordered this for my grandson. After reading the reviews,  I thought it seemed like a good watch for his age. However  it  was hard to set the time and it doesn't keep the correct time. we both were disappointed."
2.0,to small  kids size  and i pd for 2 and got 2 small ones.
2.0,"The masks are adult size, not kid size. I wanted the masks for my 8 year old and 3 year old. Mask are big for the 8 year old but will still work. Will not work for 3 year old. And one mask came ripped."
2.0,"I purchased according to the size chart and they Are a size to small.<br />This is my second pair but a different style, and the first pair was ok."
2.0,"These plastic shoe trees are adjustable in length, and very easy to use.  BUT, they don't fit very well because they are not high enough or expand, and they made off thin hard, and cheap plastic. I honestly don't think they last very long because when I installed them in my Nike and Puma shoes, they warped.  DO NOT BUY!"
2.0,Not for the girl with ANY curves
2.0,Too big in places too small in others
2.0,Small for an adult head but still nice
2.0,This is more like a ladies watch. It just barely fits around my wrist. I have bought these watches for years and this is the first time I have had this issue. I haven't gotten bigger either. If it was a tick smaller I wouldn't be able to even wear it.
2.0,Doesn't fit over my glasses right. Sent them back.
2.0,This is a horribly made pair of sneakers. The sole started coming apart immediately. First the black rubber then the lights on the side. Shoes lighted up but after about a week one shoe would only light up periodically. My son loves the type of shoe. However was a huge waste of money.
2.0,"Very cute shoe and I wanted to love it, but it fit at least one size too but and was super narrow. I plan on returning"
2.0,"The style of the glasses are cute which is why I bought them, but they had to be returned as soon as they were received. The glasses came completely crooked and uneven. They're supposed to flex to fit the growing width of a child's head, but when the glasses came with one of the sides completely askew and stretched way out with no way of fixing them they were unusable. I'm rather disappointed as it's incredibly hard to find a reasonably priced pair of toddler/children's sunglasses for girls that are classy, simple (hold the glitter and neon please), and have UV protection."
2.0,"I love the fit, look, and style-absolutely perfect. Only serious problem is the red bled into the white after a cold, delicate cycle. Can't return one I guess."
2.0,Initially I was very pleased with this product but after having it for about 1.5 months the stones started to fall out which was very disappointing. I would not recommend this to someone else.
2.0,Very cute necklace but broke after a hour of wearing it. Very delicate.
2.0,I didn’t care for the knit weave of material.  It was heavy and I didn’t want to wear something wooly and hot for a bathing suit cover up.  Fabric very clingy.  The color is my favorite but item not close to what I envisioned.
2.0,Too small.  Opened when warm weather started.  Saw it did not fit.  was going to return it and get a larger size but it said past deadline for returning.
2.0,"I wanted to love these because they had a pocket, but they were just not good enough. The medium is actually “small/medium” and appears to be about a US size 4. They are also very sheer and require a long shirt over your backside like you would wear with leggings. I gave them to my 10 year old step daughter for wearing to the playground under dresses."
2.0,It’s ok... Bette than the pictures
2.0,Product a lot bigger than I expected. Jury still out on whether to return. Not real happy with service either.
2.0,It was for my daughter and it tangled too quickly so it wasn't usable after a few days.
2.0,I liked the design on the umbrella  but it came broken and the middle medal part was bent up which made it hard to open tried to up load four picture but every time i uploaded two or more it only let one be shown so i'll do one picture at a time
2.0,order a size smaller
2.0,I ordered a 2T and got what had to be a 3 or 4. It's so big she won't be able to wear until at least next summer. Also thought it was black and white but it's actually navy and cream. That could just be my own mistake though. Overall pretty bummed cause I was pretty excited to get this one and it's going to have to just sit in the closet.
2.0,"is too smaal<br />is transparent,"
2.0,"I thought it was strange when I opened the box and the jewelry wasn't secured to the packaging, I ignored my initial thought and chalked it up to bad packaging. However, upon further inspection, they look like they've either been exposed to outside elements that caused the metal to change in color or they could have been worn.<br /><br />Also, if you're looking for a statement piece, the necklace is very short, and however, the earrings have about a 2 inch drop."
2.0,These ran so small that I couldn't put them on and wound up trowing them away
2.0,"Not very durable, as in a slight drop from 8 inches off the ground and the frame broke off on one eye piece and the bridge was all that was left on the other. I'm not too pleased with the construction but oh well. You get what you pay for"
2.0,Cute shoe but fitflop brand has no standards for sizing anymore.  The toe piece comes back too far.  If you start comparing length of this shoe to other fitflops of same size they are all different lengths.  Please standardize your sizes fitflop!  Make a size 7 a standard length.  Then offer different widths.  Getting tired of guessing at how each style will fit.
2.0,Nice looking but broke after two months of wearing it.  Outside of return window and now it's useless.
2.0,"The pattern on the skirt is nice and the material is soft but those are the only nice things I can say about this skirt,it is very very short when I put it in you can see my butt and I don't have a big butt (I don't have really any butt!) and thier was a snag in the bottom of the skirt! It ran very small I read the review so I orders up a dive and it felt very tight! I will be returning it!"
2.0,Upon my first use a seam on the left bottom leg started unraveling. I hoped for better quality from Nike. I got a replacement but the hassle of getting it replaced is my reason for two stars.
2.0,"Sizing is waaaaay off. Wear a 10-12 / size large in normal every day. Due to other reviews orderedup.. a size 16, and you have to fight the zipper to get it up and then it feels like it will bust. Sad to say I have to send this one back, too afraid it will not work. Beautiful dress otherwise."
2.0,It deff runs way small I'm a M-L so I got a L and It's probably at least two sizes too small. Also the color is more neon orange than soft pink which would have been fine because I like neon but the fit is crazy
2.0,really cheap materials to be 70 dollars . I opened the box and already the thin aluminum had light scratches imagine after a week in my pocket. Also the plastic was sliding everywhere when I tested pulling it out of my pocket. I put it right back into the box and returned it .
2.0,Very pretty but the back came off and I lost one the first time I wore them. It’s suppsoedto screw into place but it wasn’t secure.
2.0,"This is a very nice jacket and does keep you warm at about 40' with sweatshirt and tank underneath<br />However that is not the problem.<br />I wore this for only 1 day and it just started to shed all over my clothes. I wore it a couple more times, briefly, and the shedding is now on the jacket itself<br />I would've like to have kept it, but as I'm using a lint roller on my clothes now, it is being returned"
2.0,VERY thin material
2.0,"This was not great quality, looked to snag easily and the fit was huge. Not flattering at all."
2.0,The first pair I got stopped working only on the right side and yes it was charged. Second pair the lights dont change colors correctly. Love the style and all but if they would only work right!!
2.0,"The material is paper thin, see-through, and ill-fitting around the shoulders. The dress design is great and it fit properly everywhere else."
2.0,the dress is a beautiful color.  The only problem is ...if you stain it it will not come off with anything.  Please save your money.
2.0,"This dress looks cute in the picture but it's all off. It looks like a potato sack when I got it and felt like a paper bag. I'm sure someone with the right accessories and figure can rock it but I can't. I'm 5'3, 135lbs and have no boobs so it looked like the dress was devouring me. The pattern is nice though"
2.0,Ridiculously small. Quality is decent. The clickers click well with a snug click. I don't think the material is actually stainless steel.
2.0,"The elastic bands broke off so easily, couldnt keep them on the fingers to play with them. Thats why they are called &#34;finger&#34; lights, to hold them on for playtime."
2.0,I was disappointed that you couldn’t see the super heroes.
2.0,Smelt so strong.. even after I washed it. Very staticky and not well made
2.0,I ordered the sz my husband usually wears and didn’t fit need to returns them
2.0,Bracelet was missing in the package. Choker stone was fallen off when I open the package. Returning item.
2.0,"Way to small, would not fit around my waist. I am a USA women’s size 12"
2.0,Fits well. No lining. Meh
2.0,"elastic for ears lasted 3 wearings, the nose piece lasted one use, the disposable masks have better elastic and nose clip than these supposedly  reusable masks, too bad i washed them, or i would have returned these cheaply made organic masks. now i have to buy elastic and try to find metal strip and replace them, myself, with crippling arthritis  in hands. HATE THEM !"
2.0,Very cheap product but then again it was a cheap price
2.0,Shallow pockets are just as bad as no pockets.
2.0,"Do NOT buy the Dream Blue, if you're looking for a true blue color!!! It is most definitely what they call ""Teal"". It's like a peacock color, no wear near the color in the Dream Blue picture. Super bummed, I really wanted a true blue color. The fit was as expected, the color is the only issue 🥺."
2.0,"For the love of all that is Holy...DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SMELL!<br />No WOMAN wants to walk around carrying something that smells like FISH!<br />Shame, because I love the purse otherwise.  Won't keep it if that smell doesn't go away."
2.0,"Looks great, broken in 15 minutes.  Shipping was inconvenient and not on time."
2.0,"Seen in breast pockets are very odd and misplaced and upper sleeves are very tight, it's almost as if the arms are sewn backwards."
2.0,I’m 5’2” and curvy. I’m a good size 10 but I couldn’t even get them up one leg. Obviously we’ll made and we’ll packaged but almost buy 2 sizes up.
2.0,"They fit as expected.  However, they scratched up really easily.  Cheap replacements."
2.0,Far different from pic
2.0,They look like skinny jeans.
2.0,Was unable to tell from the online depiction that they had mirrored lenses... which I do not like.
2.0,cant read the engraving
2.0,When I received the belt I was missing the slip throw holder and the button to hold my belt buckle onto the belt
2.0,"This dress is perfect for spring and is a short swingy cotton that is lightweight.  I found the sizing to be extremely off.  A large actually fit my niece who is a size xs or small regularly.  I don't know if it could really be used as a ""dress"" but could definitely be used as a swimsuit cover up.  I am not a big fan of the 3 level design of the dress, it is simply okay. The royal blue color I picked is vivid and pretty."
2.0,"The band itself is fine. It's cute, its comfortable. But something about the way it snaps in doesnt work quite right and mine just pops off on the regular. Like, last night I lost my watch in the dryer- thank god the watch is super durable. By the time I realized how much of a problem it was, the return window was already closed. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,"They had more coverage than I expected, more like granny panties than the hipster I was looking for. But the main issue for me was that, because they do not have a cotton crotch I guess, the liners and pads do not stay stuck to them and instead come off and stick to my body. Beyond uncomfortable. I ended up throwing the whole set out, because I could not wear them and donating underwear feels weird."
2.0,"I returned these. I'm 5'6&#34; and 135lbs. I have a booty and muscular thighs so based on other reviews I got a large. I really wanted them to work, but they fit weirdly. They fit to size, but the rise is ridiculous high. Up to my bust and I'm somewhat tall, very uncomfortable! Tried rolling down the waistband but it gave me a kangaroo pouch there. Too bad because the style is cute and they're lightweight while not see through."
2.0,"There were a few bands in the group that were made wrong. They wouldn't lock into my watch unless twisted so no good to wear. Really sucked to it was the cute colors too. The teal, and coral pink. They were the reason I bought. Unfortunately I didn't open until after my return time. Oh well there are some good ones."
2.0,"I've been a pepper fan for quite awhile. I got my first pair from a freestyle ski competition, ever since then I've been in love with them. They where strong and I still have them to this day. Though the lens scratches quite easily the plastic is very thick. However with this pair that I bought the plastic was thinner leading to the swing arm to break. Only had it for about a month... it was a big bummer because I like the tint they put in there glasses and that they are polarized. But if they keep on making poor quality glasses. I will have to find a new brand."
2.0,"thumb holes!  A hood! Length, color...at first I was delighted with this purchase, especially at the price. But the zipper jammed and then split the fourth time I zipped it up. Very disappointed as I was planning to order several more; if the zipper worked this would be a great hoodie that has enough styling that I wouldn't look like a slob at the office.<br /><br />Edit 4/21/21 The zipper lasted about ten minutes and then was irrevocably broken so...discarded."
2.0,"The description for these says ""...pantyhose tights..."" but they're definitely 100% pantyhose. I needed something thicker for an outdoor performance and these aren't going to cut it. They're also not true low waist. They go to just your waist, which is a nice change from being able to pull them up to your bra (as I can usually do), and they do have a nice thick waistband that doesn't cut into your skin, but they fit at my natural waist, not below which I needed.."
2.0,Definitely NOT true to size.  Very snug!
2.0,"Couldn't use them because they came without the spring bars. Actually, to be specific ONE band came with ONE spring bar, but all the others are missing the bars. Which means I can't actually attach them to my watch. I had to spend $7 on quick release spring bars.<br /><br />They're pretty cute otherwise, though I was surprised to find that only the pink one was completely pink, while the grey and yellow had white connectors"
2.0,Runs small its ill fitting not what was pictured at all not worth the money I paid for the shirt
2.0,"You get what you spend sometimes!  Pretty cheap and didn't work - didn't fit on the ring we had, per many other reviews.  Oh well . . ."
2.0,"The price isn't bad, but for officially licensed product the quality is lacking.  The image on the charm is grainy (yes, I took the film off) and the clips are pretty cheap plastic with sharps bits I will need to shave off and I won't be surprised if they were to break.<br /><br />I have bought really nice much larger acrylic charms at anime conventions in artist alley for $10 so I feel like this could have been made better quality for the price point it is listed at.<br /><br />The strap the charm is attached to is fine."
2.0,Very sheer!! Need to wear a lined dress underneath. Belt did not come w the dress.
2.0,Too big! Way bigger than it looks in the picture and the chain is very flimsy. But props to the seller. Very nice to deal with and is trying to make it right for me.
2.0,"This has a cute picture but it's too large - much larger than most masks and has a sloppy fit to it so it doesn't sit nicely on your face like most masks do.  I'm really disappointed in it.  It could have been so cute.  But in reality, it bites."
2.0,I was looking forward to getting this but when I opened it it smelt so moldy. Can't use it.
2.0,"This garment will not &#34;cinch in&#34; unwanted abnormalities such as love handles, gut, etc. What it does do is make you conscious of posture and remind you to stand up straight."
2.0,"Read carefully if you have small wrists. In one part of the advertisement is says that small firs 4.7""+ and in another part of the ad is says that small fits 5.5""+. Why they wouldn't fix this is beyond me. The correct info is that the small fits the 5.5""+.....but only briefly.  My wrist is 5.5"" and the small fit well for about a week and then stretched out of shape so that it no longer fit me. A waste of time and money."
2.0,Doesn’t look like picture at ALL. Sending back.
2.0,"The colors look cool, but they cannot withstand wear and removal well. Because they are between sizes the fit is awful. Don’t buy them."
2.0,Looks like picture however I ordered two and only ever received one.
2.0,"Mediocre with buttons on men’s shirt on the left side?? Hello!?  For folks in China making these the buttons on men’s shirts go on the right side, women’s on the left.  Jeez"
2.0,"A month late!  Other people said it was like the description, and the pics looked accurate.  I think they lost my order and got a different brand and sent it instead.  It took twice as long as originally claimed, and the dress was like those other stretch jersey ones without the rucheting but 3 inches shorter.  It was so short it was practically a tunic so I wear it with leggings or gaucho pants.  This one pictured is a nice teal.  Mine was a royal blue, no shirring on the shoulders or rucheting on the waist or back as pictured."
2.0,"I am pretty disappointed in this mug, after washing the print has begun to smear and blur. I understand it wasn't super expensive but it wasn't cheap either I expected a better product. I hand washed it and have been extremely careful again very dissatisfied with the product wouldn't recommend."
2.0,The material in the back comes up a little too high on the back of my neck making the bra slightly uncomfortable.
2.0,"Thin fabric, a little small and very short! Okay for after shower but that's it."
2.0,"Ordered one pattern, and the one that came in wasn't even close. With this product ii would definitely suggest sizing down."
2.0,"I got the Beige color which is more white than Beige, sadly. They're also incredibly sheer, you would need to wear boyshorts or something under these and those would be easily seen by how sheer these are.<br />Might be cute as swim coverup pants? But still weird with how see through they are. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I got the medium expecting them to be a little big; I'm often a small but I usually size up for looser comfort tho. The medium fits perfectly, waist is comfortably snug, legs are flowy. Would highly recommend sizing up.<br /><br />The material is buttery soft and silky. It will probably show sweat easily based on the material.<br /><br />Overall, super disappointed with how sheer they are. They could have been awesome if the fabric was thicker or double layered."
2.0,It was exactly as pictured. The &#34;e&#34; was missing out of the words. If that was corrected I might buy again.
2.0,Empire waist sit at the wrong place.
2.0,"I got this product for my 7 year old daughter.  She wore them for a few days then one of the arms came right off the glasses when she took them off.  She didn't remove them abruptly or violently.  I'm guessing it was just a defect in that particular pair, as I've seen that the majority of the reviews are good.  I might buy another pair for her upcoming birthday."
2.0,"Leggings did not have any washing instructions. Grand daughter knelled in some greasy dirt by the car, pre-treated the stains with laundry soap and washed in cold water. When they were done washing, I checked them, and the knees were totally black. All of the color and pattern was gone."
2.0,"No no no, the dress sleeves was the only think was the same as the picture! But all of the rest was like a big shirt of bad quality. I was really expected this “pretty dress” looks better. I dont have a great dress, but this dress doesnt help at all. I sent it back."
2.0,Uncomfortable. Designs rubs other fingers raw
2.0,The item did not look as nice upon delivery as it did in the promotional photo.  The fit was snug and the jacket was very lightweight.  We were quite disappointed.
2.0,Product fits well. One ripped at the Seams after first wash…
2.0,"I ordered based on the sizing chart, and my shirts are a bit big. They do not compress anything."
2.0,This top was extremely cheaply made and had low quality fabric. Reminded me of the fabric you would have for a costume in your dress up box as a kid. Can’t be too surprised considering the price though!
2.0,I'm 5feet 10 inches in the socks only came to my camp so I gave them away to another o.r.tech
2.0,Tight ban very small not shops fit
2.0,It didn’t wk with my case. Great idea but needs more wk on design.
2.0,Cheap material and jacket is not shaped like the photo
2.0,"Glasses looked nice, but after just over a week one of the sides came apart. The case was very flimsey."
2.0,Short and not sweet!
2.0,This shirt just doesn’t look right. I don’t think it’s flattering. Wore it twice most likely won’t wear it again
2.0,Necklaces are cute but not the best quality. They are very lightweight and cheaply made.
2.0,"So cute but when I had received it the metal was already blackening/chipping. It also didn't fit me right because I have small wrists; so if i left it loose it would be upside down and no one would see it, and if I tightened it it would fall to the side because there was too much weight on one side."
2.0,My son says they are little too tight.
2.0,"I like the hat, and it’s easy to use. It doesn’t fit my big head very well."
2.0,Hated it. Didn't hold my Fitbit at all and the tracker kept falling out. Slid up and down my wrist. Not meant for small wrists.
2.0,The Flashing functions stops after a few seconds on one of the gloves when I first got it. Now the other one isn't working either. Nice gloves though and fits well.
2.0,"I followed the chart which told me to order a 3XL.  That seemed large, but you never know with Asian sizing so I went by what the manufacturer said.  It is SOOO Big.  Seriously.  The top wouldn't even stay up it was that large.  I'm guessing I should have ordered a large (4 sizes smaller) but am not going to bother with trying to reorder if they can't be more accurate with their chart.  Fabric was nice."
2.0,"I ordered the ""Camel"" brown and when it arrived, the color was pumpkin. Quality great, felt good, but I just c as not wear orange."
2.0,These are not the right size so they slip out sometimes. Also i had to paint the back of them white so the design is noticeable.
2.0,the style of the Velcro straps does not let them get tight enough--but my foot is very narrow and that might have something to do with it..
2.0,"This dress seems nice, hopefully it will fit after I lose some weight."
2.0,Beautiful ring. But lied about it being sterling silver. Have been wearing it for a few day and now my finger is turning green.
2.0,My arms are squeezed into the sleeves and looks terrible. I have not wore my shirt for this reason. Too late to return.
2.0,Was not the correct color
2.0,Cute shoes but very cheaply made and started taking apart after only a few weeks.
2.0,This dress is completely unflattering. The material is terrible. The neckline was very high and the pockets kept coming out. It also had a strong unpleasant smell coming out of the bag
2.0,"The bottom part, skirt didn’t fit well"
2.0,It fell out in a couple days and lost it. Edges too rough
2.0,My son bought this to use as a missionary. It lasted for his six week training period but now both clasps holding the shoulder strap have broken.
2.0,Shirt was ok however the stitching is crap and is all knotted up around the collar making it look like crap.
2.0,"These are NOT 18 gauge screws. They are the same size (or smaller) than the 20g retainer, and they're completely useless for me.<br />I recently lost a clear gem screw, which I loved, but, unfortunately, that item was no longer available. Despite a lack of reviews, I thought these could be a good replacement, and I liked the 3-piece set aspect.<br />The gem is a nice size (not intrusive, but not too tiny), and it is designed so that it would lay flat. If you need a 20g screw, these might work. Although, honestly, these would not be my first recommendation. The 'stem' part of the post is longer than I expected. I've had similarly sized posts, and they always either stick out or poke the inside of my nose.<br />The quality seems good, and the screw portion is not bent too sharply, so they would be easy to put in. I almost hesitated to give 2 stars, but these are simply not as described."
2.0,Oh dear god this dress feels horrible. It was slightly too small and the lines created illusion of linebacker shoulders and minimized my hips. My inner arms still feel horrible from brushing against the sides.
2.0,"The necklace chain burns and irritates my neck, but the pendant is very pretty. So far, I have not found a necklace chain thin enough to thread through the pendant's tiny holes. Yes, I separated the pendant from the chain with my mighty womanly strength; and yes, it hurt my strong, yet tender womanly hands. I'll have to think of how to get the pendant onto a suitable chain. Two stars cuz you're making me work for my vanity."
2.0,well done (c.part) but the reconstructed coral looks like shiny plastic. Not worth the price.
2.0,"Several stones fell out during shipping, and although it is a beautiful jewelry set, we sent it back without reorder."
2.0,"It doesn't look like the color in the photo, more of a light gray, and it's not flowy. The size is correct but the material is too stiff to hang like in the photo, and looks more like a medical scrubs top. Also, I can see loose threads all over so I don't expect it will last. It's okay for the price but not well made or what I was looking for."
2.0,Very scratchy!
2.0,"Oh man it was huge!!  I purchased the size &#34;L&#34; which is supposed to fit 14-16.  I won't return because of postage cost, but will most likely give it away."
2.0,These pants are cute but not enough stretch. The length is good but unfortunately I will have to return them
2.0,I read that someone else had this same problem but hoped that it wouldn't happen since it is a gift for a close friend. I am going to see if I can clean off the tarnish and will return if not
2.0,Lovely fabric but way to small I returned it easily
2.0,"The material is HORRIBLE! No matter if you wash them in a gallon of Downey, the material is very scratchy! Great value for the money though, if the scratchy material doesn't bother you."
2.0,"Didn't notice when I purchased these shirts until I received them, they have two uneven lines going at a weird angle across the entire front of the shirt, looks like the shirts were put together with 3 pieces of material (cheap look). If it wasn't for the ugly stitching lines they would be good workout shirts the fit and materiel was nice."
2.0,After wearing the belts a few times they began to peel. Poor quality
2.0,"Way to long, way to big in the arm holes! Fits more like an XXL"
2.0,Gets dark too fast!!!
2.0,necklace is good...the charm is not what i expected at all. Much smaller and the details are not like in the picture (looks cheap)
2.0,It has this fun plastic backing that makes it sweaty and uncomfortable. Otherwise it would be a winner!
2.0,"I already return this, the fabric is very plastic not cotton.<br />Make you look 20 pounds heavier"
2.0,Legs are shorter than the picture. Definitely puts your junk on display in gym or golf shorts. Fine for jeans.
2.0,It is OK. Can not get the smell out of it.
2.0,looks so fake and nothing like the photos
2.0,goofy looking and cheap looking
2.0,It looks nice but certainly not a baby bag.
2.0,"Great quality plugs, but the flares are just TOO HUGE. I can't get these in no matter how much lube I used, how much lobe-massaging, etc. It sucks."
2.0,"If I wore 14-16g jewelry it would be different and I’d more than likely love these, but I fit 20g and lower, and I was expecting something a lot smaller than what I got lol, then again it’s my fault for not knowing but it just wasn’t what I expected"
2.0,"Everything was fine with the sweatpants, except the pockets were way too small."
2.0,Look nice but way too small and feel very cheap and uncomfortable
2.0,"Received my sunglasses today. I like them but... I ordered mirrored and received dark lens. That's why I only gave 2 stars. I am going to keep them but I was really looking forward to the mirrored lense. A bonus is that they came with a hard and soft shell case. Time will tell how the quality is but they look good. Update: 8/18 I noticed they have a white haze. I constantly want to clean them but it will not come off. Oh well... Looking at the only other review on here. It looks like they send you what they want you to have , not what you order."
2.0,"Super strong chemical smell, the paper material is unsealed so work with any wet materials(paints) and glue will warp and or cause to designate."
2.0,"They say men’s sock size 6-12, but my husbands foot is size 10 and he couldn’t even get his foot into the grey socks, and the red and blue socks are very tight!"
2.0,To Small For My Face!!! Returned.
2.0,They do not stay put. Good quality and good idea  though.
2.0,Very small. I am a size 6 and ordered the largest size; it was too small. I returned it.
2.0,It is sooooo tiny. Like a finger nail. I wish I hadn't have purchased this.
2.0,Coral Floral Not as pictured<br />Mine came with a white fabric lining so to wear tied shows lining and makes garment thick and heavier not sheer and light<br />DISAPPOINTING
2.0,"I was looking for a black beaded bracelet to replace one that I had that broke. This one was close enough so I gave it a shot. I liked that I didn't have to work any clasp as it is a slip-on bracelet. I liked the look of it, as well. Cons:  It was really tight on my small wrists and REALLY heavy. I ended up returning it because it was so uncomfortable."
2.0,It left marks down my side area. It was very uncomfortable. I will not recommend.
2.0,They hook on everything thing and pull out of the ears and hurt when pulled like that!
2.0,Lowerquality
2.0,"These are great for wearing inside a rubber boot, but the way they are made is not like a sock, that is supposed to fit your foot closely,. they are baggy on your foot, and that allows them to bunch up inside the boot, and makes spots that can become sore or painful. I can understand the upper part being loose enough to fold over the boot top, but the foot should fit like an actual sock, close to the foot not allowing any wrinkles or bunching, especially for the price."
2.0,"I use this band on my Samsung Gear Sport. It’s a nice looking band with a comfortable fit, but I think I should have gotten more than 4 months out of it. I’m easy on my Gear, and the band is already beginning to tear. It’s not worth your time or money."
2.0,These came ok but then I tried to clean them off before use with peroxide and they got discolored. I can’t imagine what would have happened if I had put them in my ears because they’re clearly cheap metal.
2.0,"I received the item and it looked exactly as pictured. I’m 5’7” and about 135 pounds. It fit but was slightly slimmer than I was expecting for this style. But it wasn’t bad, just different. I used the size chart to determine size.  I ended up returning the item because it had a pull in it and I didn’t love the knit. I was looking for something warmer and softer.  Looked great with jeans!"
2.0,I thought it was too tight!
2.0,I couldn't get it to fit over my head (7 3/4) so the one size fits all is not true as it does not stretch enough
2.0,In all honesty the top itself was gorgeous BUT the material itself was gross. I really wanted to keep it but I knew the material was not going to do it for me. I expected a soft material instead it’s that cheap rough material.
2.0,"A very beautiful and functional design. It is a pity that the finishing is poor, even the stitching is not well-done. Such a design deserves a better execution.I will return it as soon as I can. I would have loved to keep it."
2.0,Do not buy it looks nothing like the picture and it was way to small. Barley covered my ass and ladies I don’t really have one ahha. I ordered an XL I am not that big but I do have a big bust size I am 5.3 160 and 34 triple D’s. This looked like a joke on me sadly I was so excited to.
2.0,"I am a size 12-14 at 5'10 and usually fit into an XL w/o difficulty.  This sweater was tight and I almost thought it was the wrong size.  I buy cashmere all over for $60-80 and I thought paying over $100 would be super soft and amazing.  It is cut small and an average style and feel.  I wouldn't buy another sweater from this company.  My dry cleaner accidentally ruined my favorite Lord & Taylor grey cashmere sweater and when I tried to replace it, all were sold out except this store.  My dry cleaner even offered to get me another sweater because they recognized this one was no comparison"
2.0,Ear piece breaks very easy
2.0,"They look great in the package, but only the top layer of fabric has the pattern on it. Once you put them on the fabric stretches creating white lines through the image. They seem pretty durable, and maybe it would work if you have tiny feet so the socks don't stretch, but for me they looked pretty bad once I put them on."
2.0,"Upon first inspection, the frames, earpieces, and nose-piece were well designed and of high quality. I especially liked the earpiece design, which had a flexible section right where the earpieces makes contact with the ear. When I put the glasses on, the optics seemed weird and distorted. I compared them to others I own, and spent some time trying to figure out the problem. The only area of the glass that was clear, was in a thin strip down the middle of the glasses. Everywhere else was blurred. Since this was not consistent with my overall impression, I checked for a protective film over the glass but found none. I liked everything else about the glasses, but the primary purpose is to help you see. Given the emphasis on optical quality on the product description this is a puzzling disappointment."
2.0,"The tutu I recieved did not match the description. The pictures on the product page are saturated making it look great. I would recommend putting up unedited pictures. The color on the tutu is more of a pale pink and the frills are not ""fluffy"" as I expected they would be."
2.0,"It’s too heavy, but it’s beautiful"
2.0,This mask is too thin compared with other KF94 masks I purchased before.<br />Not individually wrapped. 10 mask per pack.<br />I wouldn’t buy it again.
2.0,"They are a very pretty assortment but the pin is thin and weak, It would be ok for a thin sweater but not for a felt hat. It bends. I should have taken hint from previous review.  Ah well, live and learn."
2.0,It runs small. I’m a size small and got a M/L it still was nearly unbearable. It caused the metal boning to buckle and ruined the silhouette. That and the pics led me to believe that the crotch to bottom of the lace was longer than it was when it arrived.
2.0,Loved the inscription but the metal turned almost immediately! At least they could have used sterling silver...
2.0,"The top of the dress was not sized right. If you have any chest, its going to be way tight for the rest of the fit of the dress. It was otherwise cute so I was disappointed that the fit was so off."
2.0,"It says it’s sterling silver, but I question that. Only the ring that the necklace piece goes through says 925. Also the pendant is TINY!!! Even the pen cap next to shows how tiny it is. Last disappointment- the stones are so freaking small and dull. The advertised pic makes it look more grand than what it is. Whelp. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this pullover; I wore it as a part of my travel outfit for vacation. The pullover is adorable and the fit is great. It kept me warm thorough out the cold flight.<br /><br />CONS: it pills easily and it has a major downside... it sheds, a lot! When I took off the sweater my entire undershirt was covered in a black fur left behind the sweater. Even the parts of my arm (that were not covered by the shirt) had sweater fur on it. It was absolutely embarrassing when I took off the pull over when I arrived at my very warm destination to reveal that I was covered in this shed from the pullover.<br /><br />I did not receive washing instructions (if any are available) that could have helped deal with this."
2.0,"The quality is not that good, also sleeves are super slim and thus tore as i was trying it on for the first time."
2.0,Do not order your exact size. I had to order 2 sizes up.
2.0,"I bought this watch less than a week ago and has some issues already. First, the watch states it's waterproof (not that I shower with it which I don't) and has accumulated moisture inside the watch. I do the occasional hand wash and for it to do that was quite shocking. In addition to the moisture, after wearing it one day, the following day, the watch seems to not keep adequate time. I have to adjust it daily because it is 5-10 behind. So I just stop wearing it. Waste of money in my case.<br />The band is long so it may need to be adjusted and seems like it should hold up to daily wear and tear. But other than the issues above, I will not be buying from this brand anymore."
2.0,"My MIL asked for gloves to wear for her granddaughter's wedding and reception.  Something elegant to go with her evening gown for the event. These arrived promptly and in good condition, but the quality was that of something from a Disney Princess dress up pack from when my daughter was 8, not for an actual event.  The stitching of the fabric was uneven and the fabric, honestly, was not of the best quality.  Better options are out there than these..."
2.0,"Purchased in March 2021.<br />While I did not expect this lens to last forever given the price, I did hope they would make it through the rest of the year. Instead, they started flaking after only 3 months of gentle use. Never were they cleaned with anything other than a clean lens cloth. The lens itself remains scratch free. I also found the optical clarity to be less than the original lens though not so bad to be a nuisance to wear. For the price, they are just OK, but there are other lenses available for the same or slightly more money and it is those I will purchase ie future."
2.0,Bad cheap and cheesy.  I suppose the bargain should have been an indication of quality.  I followed the reviews and regret it.
2.0,The sizing runs very small.
2.0,fits kind of loose
2.0,"Colors are faded. Fits tight and still falls down, not a comfortable fit and does not contour at all.  In the picture, shows it a bit baggy at the bottom but does not fit like that.  No stitching and no cleaning instructions provided. 2 stars because I was disappointed with what I got, but should have expected that at this price point."
2.0,I returned this. I wear a medium in everything and this was too small. I want my pjs to be comfy not tight. Otherwise material felt nice.
2.0,Not for lips
2.0,The picture is accurate but you are getting what you pay for. The material is thinner than I thought and came out of the package incredibly wrinkled.  I should have ordered down a size as the paid I got is comically too big. I'll wear them when I paint.
2.0,"I was really excited for the purse and the price, but it began to fall apart the second day I used it. It seems like a fairly easy fix with tools, but it's disappointing at the same time. First the zipper tag came off, and when I tried to use the other side to finish closing the purse, the other side broke right off."
2.0,"I am 5'2&#34;, size 34C chest, and this dress fits perfectly!! Not too long or super tight.<br /><br />Edit- I have worn this dress only twice and it is pilling really badly. Hasn’t been washed yet. So disappointed."
2.0,"Is not a woman shirt, but good quality"
2.0,"The barbell on this is stainless steel, but the front of the earring is not. So the silver coated started to wear away and majorly infected my ears."
2.0,"Well the size is about a child's size. But it's nice other wise. Not what I was expecting in size, can't give it to my original recipient but a young niece will be fine."
2.0,I think size is different<br />Too long too fat<br />Material is good
2.0,ridiculously huge
2.0,The fabric was soft and the print was pretty but it was a good 2 sizes too big. I returned it.
2.0,I would not call these seamless as there is a seam at the toe and the knots on the sides did not seem to have any less of a seam than other socks.
2.0,This is so tight that it just looks awful.  What a shame as I really liked the dress.
2.0,Although it works it is not really acceptable for an elderly person that has dexterity and vision loss.  It will give the time (somewhat of a low volume) if the wearer has the strength in the fingers to push a button on the side.  We found the button to be too stiff for an elderly person with arthritis.
2.0,way too tight and not for anything above a C cup
2.0,Runs small more for a child's head
2.0,Love the dress but it came in the wrong size . Can i return it por get a refund or the right size? Please lmk.<br /><br />This dress is so comfy and I love the fabric.
2.0,Not very sticky so this product really doesn't work. Put in a hat and fell right out.
2.0,Warm but is too small. Needs to be longer to cover my dumbo ears.
2.0,Slightly rough and cheap fabric
2.0,not oversized as portrayed. its half the size of an oversize scarf.
2.0,"Wasn't worth the money, very cheaply made,  tight around head wouldn't recommend buying them! Sorry I spent the money on them! Fit me three year old niece, she plays with them!"
2.0,"Something told me to get at least one size larger than normal. So, ordered XXL and their XXL is equivalent to a small, maybe a medium. If I normally wear an XL, and I put this XXL on right out of the package and can see my belly button, what's that tell you?  The material is ok (could be better), but I have a bad feeling not only is this shirt going to shrink but I'm betting I'll lose half of its color either down the drain or ruin the rest of the wash.  Buy quality you know, don't guess with this one."
2.0,This dress is pretty but offers no chest support and hugs your back so tightly where it shows all the unpleasant back rolls
2.0,"This belt has a very thin elastic band, smaller than in the picture, so beware at least they are responsible and are refunding me the money for sending this item not as pictured, I threw it away because it is too thin and looks like a toy."
2.0,I was hoping I could fit my phone in here and use it as a little purse... no luck.
2.0,"The clasps don't grip as well as the ones for the butterfly clip/brooch sweater guard do, so this one is even less practical.  They're pretty, but meh..."
2.0,I'm not happy with it I thought I was going to love it. The material is very thin the size is like 2 times bigger than me I could wear a small I usually wear large I think I'm going to attempt shrinking them they was on sale 3 dollars is all I'd get back it makes more sense to keep them and pair it with a oversized shirt or dress This item you must size down some however stretching them too much could result in them being possibly see through
2.0,"Cheap looking, awful color , not as pictured.<br />The tull on the side it doesn't match with the color of the outfit, not well finished. It would look better with out it .<br />I will post a pic later"
2.0,"i like it but can wear it but use it as a book mark, a cool one<br /><br />Edit: waytoo damn fragile, had used it to sit in my old book but just now i grabbed it and went to sit in my chail and the bottle just tapped my arm rest and shattered, WAAAAYYYYY to fragile especially for glass and now i got glow dust everywear."
2.0,The slip already tore after the first wash.  Material is very cheap.
2.0,The length of the stocking were barely mid thigh for these “adult” stockings and I’m only 5 ft!
2.0,The mask fit too tightly.
2.0,Actually I was REAL PISSED that it BROKE within an HOUR of it being delivered and put on my arm!!!!! So mad regardless of the price I spent that i dont know if I will do anything about it BY TALKING TO SOMEONE because i would be LOSING MY TEMPER..
2.0,"Very easy to break. And maybe its just me, but I could only figure out how to put it on like twice. Even then it still hung uneven."
2.0,wore out in only 2 months of use
2.0,I went by the size chart provided and bought both the XL and XXL because I didn't know which would fit.  I could have gone true to size and ordered my usual large.<br />This dress is a heavy material and hung on me.  I wanted a fun dress for a spring wedding and this was not it.
2.0,"Buy them bigger then you need, mine we’re a bit tight but they were cheap enough to just keep and not return and give me incentive to lose a little weight"
2.0,no pockets!!!!!
2.0,"I decided to try this jacket out despite some bad reviews and was not happy, the material is very thin and definitely not coat like. Think more work blazer. It also runs very small, i am normally a small/medium and got an extra large and it barely fit. I personally didn’t like it but I will say I was able to return it very easily."
2.0,"Thin cotton, too lightweight"
2.0,"I wanted to LOVE these leggings, but they fell short in a few ways. I am 5'3 and 137 and ordered a Medium. They fit OK- but after a few hours of wear they are baggy around the knees. The length is also kind of weird for me- they aren't tight at the bottom of the pants around my ankle/calf. They kind of flare out off my leg and in order to get them to fit tight around the bottom I have to pull them up higher on my calf. This makes the rest of the leg bunched up from the extra fabric. The worst part is the waistband!! I had a baby 4 months ago and was looking for a higher waisted legging that had a wide thick waistband for a little extra support. These pants look like they have a wide waistband, but thee really only have a 1/4 inch of SUPER tight elastic at the top of the waistband that digs in really hard and makes an obvious bulge above and below the band. Its uncomfortable and unattractive. I DO like the material of these  leggings, but they seems to attract and hold onto any kind of hair they even come close to. Carry a lint roller when you wear these!"
2.0,After only wearing the band for a few weeks it has already faded in color. Very disappointed
2.0,Beautiful earring; I say earring because only one came in the mail.
2.0,Pups loves it but it didn't take long for her to chew pieces off. Then it is no longer safe to keep. Lasted a week.
2.0,"Hated the collar, doesn't lay properly."
2.0,The slipper socks fit well and they're very soft. Not very thick though. Truly typical sock-like thickness. Based on the thickness and the little non-slip discs they would likely be most comfortable on carpeted floors. On tile or wood floors you can feel the hardness of the discs. Had one of the straps not broken the first time I put it on I'd have given 3 stars.
2.0,"Great color. However, the sides are rouched (doesn’t show that in picture). The sleeves are cut incredibly narrow & a bit high. Material feels cheap & harsh with no give, so my breasts are smooshed down. (I typically wear a 10-12, size Med-Lg pants/jeans/leggings, & Lg tops - 5’5’, 165lbs.) I like my hi/lows by Annabelle & Janasci to flow, so I always buy lg/xl (order up). I did the same here & it was like putting on a straight jacket! I’m going to hold onto it though b/c I do love the color & I’m hoping if I wash it in cold & streatch it out when wet, let it dry, then tumble air dry it to soften it up, it *may* work, since I’m still working my lifestyle plan to get healthier & drop some lbs/tone up. Tl;dr - spend the extra $$ on Annabelle products - they’ve got the BEST selection & are beyond comfy if you love this trend..."
2.0,Daughter really looked forward to this shirt. It’s not a chunky sweatshirt. It’s a silky cheap uncomfortable fabric.
2.0,I bought these thinking they were thick boot socks. They are more like thick stockings. They began rolling down as soon as I pulled them up. They can't be worn without garters
2.0,"Beautiful color,. But if you're a voluptuous woman, be careful, because the dress is NOT flattering. I ended up returning it."
2.0,Too expensive for cheap Quality
2.0,Hat came semi crumpled in a zip lock bag.  It's slightly faded like it's been sitting in a wherehouse for a couple years.  I buy these hats often and never received one in this condition.  Definitely returning the item.
2.0,They run a little small and slip off constantly. I wouldn't recommend.
2.0,My coin seems to be close to falling out and it doesn't hold or display well once seated inside.
2.0,"Did not want ankle socks, returned."
2.0,Fit larger than I would of liked
2.0,"Sending back for a refund, the stone was to loose,And while I was at the grocery store I lost the stone. Other than that it's very beautiful and true to it's size."
2.0,"I ordered 9.5 n and received 10 m. They are pretty and I would love to wear them, but they are not for me."
2.0,This outfit was cute but the sizing was way off. I don’t think my baby could ever wear it. The pants were long and skinny and the shirt was very wide.
2.0,This suit is really cute but the torso is too short so I am unable to wear it .
2.0,These broke after a few wears.  The clasps are flimsy and bendable and the piece that goes through them cannot sustain the weight of the earring.  Don't buy these unless you only plan to wear once!
2.0,"The material is nice and soft, but the length only went to just below the knees, not down to the ankles as shown in the image, so it is not a maxi dress."
2.0,off fit
2.0,"Too sheer, the material was too leightweight"
2.0,"I purchased these for my daughter who picked them out because they are very glittery and shiny, after 1 day of use the shoe lace holder ripped off I feel as if I should have just went to payless and purchased shoes. not happy with the purchase."
2.0,Way smaller than they stated. Only fit around my legs. Not even close to fitting my mother’s legs with her lymphadema.
2.0,A very heavy wallet even when empty. Zippers stiff and hard to work with<br />Would not reccomend or buy again
2.0,"Loves it for the 5 days it lasted but I will not be buying this item again the top metal flowers came off then it cracked in half they looked great my mother still has her's but she's barley worn it, not good for practical use."
2.0,"Dislike not for medum/large legs & thighs ,for slimmer small size legs/thighs."
2.0,Way to small for the size that I bought.
2.0,It looks very fake looks more like for a child haven't worn it yet not sure if I would. Maybe for a costume party.
2.0,The light blue is not what’s pictured. Looks kind of tacky & they fit very awkward on my body
2.0,"These sandals fit perfectly and are comfortable- BUT THEY BROKE THE FIRST TIME I WORE THEM! The string that ties around the strap near the big toe completely unraveled and I was stuck with one shoe for the day (not fun). I attempted to wrap it back around myself, but nothing worked. The photo shows the left string and how it broke- this is how it looked AFTER my best attempt to fix it.<br />Not worth the money and now I have one comfy sandal."
2.0,When received glasses there were lots of scratches n smudges on them. I have tried cleaning them with water n eye glasses cleaner but smudges still there. I work as nurse case manager and need these for work. Not pleased with them. It seems like they were used or not stored properly.
2.0,"Cute necklace that looked good and fell well on me length wise, but it broke the first time I wore it."
2.0,"I didn't care for this shirt, I returned."
2.0,"I should have examined this picture more closely before purchasing these sunglasses; there are clusters of studs on both sides that give these a feminine, bedazzled appearance.  I could not possibly wear them without facing an onslaught of well-deserved jibes from friends, family, and possibly even strangers.  It's too bad, because these would be cool glasses sans studs."
2.0,"Cool concept & fit, especially the (monk) hood, but the garment has no way of keeping it closed up-front, even thou the description states ""zippered""?!<br />Contacted manufacturer & they apologized & suggested using a ""paperclip""...but perhaps a safety-pin or fancy ladies lapel-pin would work better, if needed/desired.<br />Too cheap to make fuss for Return...<br />There's your review...<br /><br />~B"
2.0,I bought these for my nieces for Christmas  but when it came I was so disappointed .<br />I cannot give these as gifts.
2.0,The fabric is pretty much the same as medial scrubs.  Definitely not the same nice fabric as most Salon quality.
2.0,It smells awful. It has to be washed many times to get rid of the odor
2.0,"I got an XS and I am about 5'5 and 105lbs. I figured that after the company fixed the sizing problem I would fit nicely into an XS, however, it is huge on me. It fits well up top, but is very loose around my stomach and a lot longer than pictured. I will say that the dress is still very pretty and the design looks just like the picture, I just wish it would have fit."
2.0,"Cheap looking, had to return."
2.0,The color is pretty but the dress was way to large in the bust and too small in the waist. The material was awful
2.0,It looks ok but its not water resistant in any way. Do not even wash your hands with it on. I did once the first day i put it on and mine got foggy.
2.0,Pretty bit runs large and you can’t return it without paying for shipping.
2.0,I have a few other &#34;Free to Live&#34; tops and I love them. I could barely get this one over my head and the bust was stretched so much it was see through.
2.0,"I realized the price was very inexpensive, but they just felt flimsy on.  I returned them and bought a more expensive pair."
2.0,"Very large, long, and slopping looking. Love the colors but this dress looks like a night shirt- not flattering at all. Unfortunately, I had to send back."
2.0,the dress is lovely i wore it and it came with a snag in the inside when you put on the dress it can be seen i was highly disappointed other than that the dress was lovely
2.0,Feels like an 80’s track suit.  Very Golden Girlish…
2.0,I'm 5'7&#34; 170 so I bought this in a larger;width wise it fit fine...but the length of it is way off & i would not be able to wear this anywhere!
2.0,"Cute, but quality is cheap. I had 3 break in one day."
2.0,"Small size, big seams rub toes.  Might be Ok for small mans feet or women.  I wont be wearing them."
2.0,The only thing I didn't like was that they advertise to have aeropostal wrote on the sock.. That's a lie these socks don't have anything wrote on them.. That's the reason I bought them because they had aeropostal wrote on them.
2.0,The emergency snap is very weak and won't stay snapped together. Falls off your neck if you have it on you.
2.0,"I wanted this to work so badly. I tried many ways of wearing it. Simply, if I put anything ontop of it, the collar stood up and made me look like a pilgrim in a Thanksgiving pageant. The material is great and it fits nicely otherwise. The collard sadly just wasn't designed to lay flat on my shoulders."
2.0,"- Buckles are scooped out / hollow on underside, photos deceptive<br />- Received old version of belt, not new<br />- Ordered 1 belt, received 2"
2.0,"Fit was nice and the print was bold an beautiful. Unfortunately, the quality was lacking.  I sent it back."
2.0,"smaller than thought it would be, does not fit a man unless they have small wrists"
2.0,Cut small for 3x.
2.0,"The cons...The picture is not the chain saw you get, the noise is a 5 second unrealistic loop and is not very loud the paint job is poor...the pros good size, light weight, chain spins. Verdict this prop is not worth 50 bucks at all 20 bucks tops. 2 stars for the moving chain and size ."
2.0,Product was thin<br />And as promised it arrived by the date stated<br />But it looked cheap and folded in a little bag<br />It shrunk upon the first wash<br />And is now in a pile to be donated<br />My daughter wore it to dinner<br />And that’s that
2.0,This product worked for its purpose only one time. I was trying to fill it up again to go for a Day hike and the bottom where it's attached to the bag to the straw was leaking from the back part.  Luckily I had purchased another water bladder bag. I'm hoping they'll resend me a new one.
2.0,A little bit tight and not comfy when you workout beside the non breathable low fabric quality that created a very bad smell during my regular 1hr workout.
2.0,"Love the look of this sandal but the size 0-6 months looks more like a 12 months. Unfortunately, my son won't be able to wear it this summer."
2.0,"it gives no shape to your body and there isn't even loopholes for the &#34;belt&#34; part.<br />I'm 5&#34;2, 140 lbs. curvy. Very cheap material."
2.0,The idea of it was cute. However did not like the feel of the fabric and totally looked like robe on me!
2.0,"When these came in, I was excited to try them. However, within a day of wearing one, the lace ripped in 2 small spots. I tried another and it was fine. Then the third one, well the tiny plastic side support broke out of both sides. Overall, I am not happy with them and will be returning them. Hopefully the company will accept 3 back without the tags on them."
2.0,"Very dark lense, not great for the vision when its cloudy or getting dark. Also not great for dark waters."
2.0,It has good quality but to big for my wife’s tiny wrist couldn’t get it right
2.0,"Very small, definatly order 2 sizes more than you think"
2.0,not happy at all...smaller then I thought..backing very clumsy and hard to use..would not recommend
2.0,"I bought these to wear under my summer dresses and around my place. I will still do this, but I ordered a large and these are more like small, so they're very unflattering."
2.0,Waist is tight
2.0,They are so pretty! Put the wings droop down and don’t stay the way they are supposed to like a cuff. I will be returning mine because of that reason. I wish they worked like they were supposed to because they really are cute.
2.0,Too thin!! Returning!!
2.0,"Extremely small, I used their sizing chart and I couldn't even get my arm through the sleeve.  I would say that the 8/10 is more of a 4/6. The bodice was far from being buttonable. The length was long and I am 5' 8&#34; 140lb.  Material was rough and uncomfortable."
2.0,Ordered 1 size up because reviews said they run big.  Not so.  Should have gone up 2 or 3 sizes.  Disappointed
2.0,the sizing is way smaller than what us should be small from the waist😅😅😅😅
2.0,"The fabric is cheap, after few washes, the fabric started to look very bad. I liked the fit as I have a flat stomach and decent arms. It looks ok but it won't last long."
2.0,I love this - BUT - the veil stands up in the air and NOT down over your face!  This morning I took a needle and thread and had to TACK IT DOWN from end to end.  It's a little better but NOTHING like the picture!
2.0,"I thought these shorts would provide more padding in the proper areas, however, I found them to be rather<br />uncomfortable.  They did not protect my crotch area as expected.<br />I constantly have to readjust them as I am riding or they cause more irritation to the areas  hitting the bike seat.<br /><br />Not the best<br />but they are made in the USA which drew me toward them"
2.0,"The material is very rough. It’s like if you combined a paper bag with cheap canvas. It’s also pretty see thru. On the plus side, it’s a good beach cover up."
2.0,Runs super small.  Looks like a cute dress.
2.0,"Pay close attention to the image where measurements are given in CENTIMETERS...the umbrella is doll-sized and NOT as large as pictured in the bridal photo.  Nice quality, but really only good for a decoration or small child/doll use."
2.0,"I do like it but it’s NOT sterling silver. I don’t even need the stamp or not, but it is not silver."
2.0,"Runs way too small, even given the size chart.  I am 5'11&#34; 195 pounds and these things were like wearing a straight jacket.  If you are smaller then me, size accordingly.  If my size or larger, don't bother getting them."
2.0,Great while they lasted.  Started developing holes after about 10 uses.  Not worth $20.
2.0,Cute but super thin material. Need to take it to the tailor to inquire if he can sew in a lining.
2.0,"I like this purse a lot BUT after about 2 weeks, the zipper keeps getting stuck in the lining.  The lining is way to loose inside the purse and the excess wants to end up in the zipper when opening and closing it.  It's a shame because I love the size and design!"
2.0,The band itself is nice and looks great but the fabric is starting to unravel at the edges after only wearing it for a few months and not getting it wet in the shower.
2.0,"I am paralyzed and had hoped this product would help my swelling.  It was hard to put on put did pull off very easily.<br />In the middle of the night, one leg was burning at the top so moved sock partway down only to awake two hours later with burning at the cuff.  The sock was apparently too small (ordered x large) but do not understand the burning."
2.0,Feels pretty cheaply made but pretty
2.0,The item was to small like a doll baby size.
2.0,"I made amistake,I don't like,on the website I got fooled by the picture"
2.0,LIKE THE PENDANT BUT MADE CHEAP. HEART FELL OFF ONE WE GOT AFTER WOREN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
2.0,This is very pretty but....the clock broke and has now fallen out completely.  Save your money and look elsewhere. Only worked for a few months.
2.0,This is a paper-thin 70% rayon 30% linen shirt.
2.0,too clingy for summer heat
2.0,"Good for costume jewelry, not much else. Gold plating lasts two weeks with daily use, wears off in places and its a dull bronze underneath. Same with chain. Looks crappy now, unwearable. I dont trust chains in this price range now. Got a 14k gold plated chain for -40 bucks, hopefully that one lasts."
2.0,"The material is weird, not normal sweatshirt material, but it is soft.  Every dog hair and piece of fuzz seems to srick to the material and all I did was try it on.  The sleeves are blue and the sweatshirt is black.  It runs a little small."
2.0,Strange shape!
2.0,Had a hard time keeping to bracelet on. It kept coming loose & falling off.
2.0,Looks cheap but I cannot expect more for the price
2.0,Watch is decent but bracelet is cheap and is the hardest watch I’ve ever had to change the links. Damaged the cheap pot metal bracelet because pins so tight and misformed. The case is also cheap material now that I have had experience with other watches. But it does work......
2.0,"If you want the item looks like in the picture, ask for two or three sizes over yours. Quality is poorly  fair. The most important: exactly the same item you can get at any Aeropostale retailer in those clearance boxes for no more than 2 or 3 bucks, each. The item is extremely expensive."
2.0,"I purchased these earrings for $7.99 as part of a Lightening Deal during the Christmas shopping season. The list price is supposedly $39.99, but I find this hard to believe. Had I paid that much for them, I would be irate and would be returning them immediately! I actually bought 2 sets of these...one for myself and one for my daughter. The metal does not look silver, it's dark and feels cheap; and, the stones are not as bright as shown in the picture. I'll still try to wear them just to give them a chance, but I would not recommend them. They were being sold for $7.99 for a reason, and I should have known better."
2.0,Too small. I expected them to be longer.
2.0,I have a big head. These were way too big
2.0,The color of the band was more orange in tone than brown.
2.0,Bought this to use for a weekend costume for an escape room. We use our capes every weekend for one of our games. I washed this multiple times. It “molts” everywhere. You’ll have gold lint all over you and it’s just falling apart at all times. I was very disappointed in it.<br /><br />It’s big and thick and looks cool. But you better be prepared to have it shed all over you more than a dog or a cat.
2.0,"Not at all what we thought they would be.  These are super small and cheap, lightweight plastic.  Dollar store material."
2.0,Runs small got grey disappointed in the color and length it’s Very Very  purple Not grey and it’s very very short
2.0,Nice shape but so small !
2.0,"Ordered first one in Medium....zipper was sewn sloppily and packaging was a mess - dress was merely thrown into a plastic bag with a label. Dress was too tight across ribcage, which i found odd. Reordered a size Large....came beautifully folded, packaged, complete opposite of the first dress. This dress was sewn straight along zipper seam...and was WAY too big!!! I think had first dress been sewn with care, it would have fit! Wasn't going to keep playing games, even for that price..."
2.0,Foggs up and water leaks in.
2.0,I did not like the fabric. It feels and acts more like spandex.
2.0,Not happy! The ad says 10 pieces And I only received 4 & paid $10 for 4 Stupid beads. And Amazon Your No Flipping help! The beads are nice but not that flippin nice. Will not order again. Highway robbery!
2.0,"The earring is so tight on the ear, should be made bigger around, it’s like a cuff, no room to move it, pinches my ear 🤦‍♀️"
2.0,"The zipper is sewn in with the seam. I’m<br />Confused because the only zipper that is on the pants is on the side. That zipper is only a fashion zipper, it is not an actual pocket. There are two side pockets, but that is it. I feel like this product was falsely advertised and I wasted my time purchasing and waiting for it."
2.0,"did not last 2 months, before the zipper broke and the material began to fray. Not worth the money"
2.0,Nice wallet a lot of compartments....nice color a bit shiny but I'm sure it will wear over time
2.0,top strap too bulky
2.0,"They are comfortable but a bit too big.  I use them for slippers only.  They are not very attractive, but that doesn't matter to me as much as comfort."
2.0,"Cute, comfortable, casual dress, but BEWARE! The dress shrunk 4” after being washed in cold water and air dried. I can no longer wear it and it is too late to return it."
2.0,"I really wanted to LOVE this jacket! I bought it for my almost 2year old for Christmas and I bought a size up because it was so cute, I wanted her to wear it as long as she could. The jacket overall was nice but it was defective.😩 As you can see in the photo, the design on the back was sewn into the sleeve on the front, so I couldn’t even get my daughters arm into the jacket to see if it even fits! I’m going to return the jacket, and order another one. Hopefully the next one is not defective and she’ll be able to wear it."
2.0,"Everything about it was ok, but one thing made it terrible, and that is the chest. I am a B cup and it flattened out my chest! I don't understand how you could design such a dress and not adjust the bust accordingly...I think it is meant for a more typical Asian body."
2.0,Overall  liked the vest but it sizes way big
2.0,"Really disappointed in the quality of this watch. Right after I set it up, the battery completely died. The set-up process was also difficult to understand, so I ended up watching a video on how to do it instead. It was all around frustrating. The seller reached out in regards to offering me a new watch, which was kind of them to do. However, I had declined their offer because I had already found something else on the market that suits my needs better."
2.0,tight and long collar. Very uncomfortable. My neck is not thick either. If anything it's a little small
2.0,This is a tiny pendant with a very tiny stone.
2.0,Perdio el color muy rapido
2.0,"I bought these gloves because I like to go walking no matter what the weather and needed warm gloves to help me brave with cold winter days. I'm a person who doesn't really like to be cold and up in my sixties in age. These gloves did not seem to keep my hands as warm as I anticipated (could have been because of age). Even when the temperature has been around 30 degrees Fahrenheit, my fingers still get cold after being out longer than 20 min. I would have sent them back, but I messed up the packaging and wore them too many times to test the temperature. I didn't feel like the seller would be able to resell them."
2.0,The band for the waist is not large enough it flips down.
2.0,It shines to much and looks very cheap in quality.
2.0,"Basicly it is ugly, I'm sry."
2.0,Demaciado transparentel !!
2.0,Inside turned a nasty orange brown color after first wash.
2.0,Cheap and rust then breaks
2.0,"Doesn’t deserve this price, I will give it to someone"
2.0,"Weird sizing.  Way too big in the bust, but too tight through the middle.  Straps kept showing.  Needed it for a wedding, so had to make do."
2.0,The material was very duty but the shirt was small. I have a bigger chest and it did not fit correctly.
2.0,"For the price you can't beat these, it doesn't hurt the wallet too bad if they're disposable after a couple washes. But the yellow cuff seam on mine are all starting to fray before even being washed for the first time. I've trimmed some up and tried to melt the ends of the thread with a lighter to prevent further unraveling, but I don't expect them to last very long. I've bought similarly priced gloves that are much thicker and haven't unraveled over YEARS of farm use and washing, so I personally wouldn't purchase these again."
2.0,"The earrings arrived with some spots of tarnish.  I have had these earrings already for years and they just started to tarnish.  I wanted to buy new ones but with them already tarnished, it wouldn't be a long relationship."
2.0,"I love the concept of this, and it fits fits nicely under a top, sweater etc.  however when I tried it on the material was a bit stiff/rough and actually scraped my neck  from  contact with the fabric . Hopefully the vendor has a recommendation, otherwise I will have to return."
2.0,"These feel like cheap pool sandals with the only benefit being one is thicker than the other.  Even though they fit properly, my feet slip and slide in them, there’s no grip.  From now on it’s gluing or nailing a heel lift<br />to my sandals.  If they are going to charge such an exorbitant amount they should at least get better quality sandals to start with!"
2.0,"Ok, so you have this expensive Longine watch.  They recommend that you keep it moving to keep it working well.  Not this product.  I purchased it with great faith that it would do the job...  Sad experience, but good customer relation."
2.0,"El tallaje pequeño y muy bajito de tiro, yo envié la devolución el sabado 27 de oct"
2.0,Not good detail in the picture - it is not something I would have picked - it is not me!
2.0,"I ordered a size up from what I normally wear to make sure it fit and it was still too small. It was also pretty short.<br /><br />The accessories were very cheap. The $1 store near my house sells better dress up accessories. The headband was way too small and the beads on it looked Incredibly sad.<br /><br />The details on the dress were nice.<br /><br />Overall, you’d do better off finding just the dress somewhere else and buying the accessories separate."
2.0,Not even 35 above is what they should be called.
2.0,Loved it at first but unfortunately it fell apart with very light use. I may have used it 10-20 times. Back to the drawing board.
2.0,"Pen didn't write well. Had to pull the tip out and replace the  tip and the ink in order to get the pen to write. Looks nice but, not useful unless it is modified by the buyer."
2.0,"I loved this band and got tons of compliments on it. I wear my watch daily. After one month (rec'd on July 15th) it broke. Also, definitely NOT real leather."
2.0,These shoes were really cute but unfortunately they started coming apart after just one wear...not worth the money!!
2.0,It fit weird at the top...like really wide and loose.
2.0,"Decent pants and definitely soft. However the waist band is not stretchy and relies only on the tie. They are also NOT high rise at all as it looks in the photo, I feel like the band sits right above my pubic bone and either gives me uncomfortable camel-toe when I pull them up, or my behind crack is showing. I really have not worn them much because of this, unless it's laundry day and my preferred comfy pants are all being washed."
2.0,Nice looking item. Way too small. One size does not for all.
2.0,They break very easily in the tip.
2.0,"The XXL I ordered is an 8-10 at best. I am not overweight and usually wear a 10-12 in shirts, but I ordered the XXL (14) because I have a larger bust, live in a hot climate and wanted the shirt to fit loosely. This shirt didn't fit anywhere. The arms were too tight, the sleeves were too short and it was very fitted, not loose at all. The measurements given must be for the actual inches from seam to seam, not the &#34;sized to fit X inches&#34; we're used to on US/European size charts. US/European sizes incorporate wearing ease, which is actual inches plus enough extra length or width to allow you to move, bend, sit, etc, comfortably. To make this even a fitted shirt, you'd probably have to add at least 2&#34; to the stated measurements on the chart. For a loose fit, add at least 4&#34;. Additionally, the fabric is so see through that if you perspire or get caught in the rain, this shirt will become transparent.<br /><br />I wish that Amazon would require that the sellers of Asian produced clothing either, A) produce clothing to US/European size standards or B) be required to post that the clothing is sized for the Asian market and the stated sizes will be much smaller than expected.  I would wish for option &#34;A&#34; because there are probably good vendors out there that are selling clothing on Amazon that are sized as expected for this market, but as the saying goes, &#34;once bit, twice shy&#34;. Until something changes, either shop for clothing elsewhere or anticipate that your chances of receiving a garment that fits as you expect is a crap shoot at best."
2.0,Hurts my childs legs around the opening even with socks on.
2.0,"What a baggy cheap jumper, this Vendor misled its customers big time. If you purchase it anyway don’t complain. I should have read the reviews very very disappointed this is not what a a Aline jumper should look or fit."
2.0,There is a tag that is sewn in to see all 5 pair together and even if you slice the thread it leaves a hole in every pair that stretches when worn and eventually just tears all the way down. I’m on my third pack of boys undies in 3 months bc they all rip. :/ not worth it honestly.
2.0,Bought these shoes for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. She was very excited to have them. I loved the remote and all the different setting. After three days of wearing them the right shoe was no longer working. It would only come on and not hangs colors.  I was pretty bummed about this with the higher reviews it received.
2.0,"Too small,  and the clasp was difficult to manage.  Sent it back"
2.0,"The fabric was soft, lightweight and a nice color, but the dress was too large (even though I ordered by bust size). It was also cut oddly, the v neck being very wide and low. It would require a shirt beneath it, but even at that, it still wouldn't look normal bc the v neck is too wide. I am not sure who this would fit..."
2.0,"NO FLY !  Boy was I surprised when I went to use the business end. I thought maybe I put them on backwards, but no, there was a tag in back and no fly in front. The length and fit were good, the waistband slightly more narrow than I like, but comfortable enough. material definitely feels smooth like satin. Did not wash"
2.0,Very poor quality all small sizes that could only fit pinky
2.0,"I LOVE the end look, however, it is not spaced out enough at all… had to pull it apart and really work to get it in. It’s way too small to screw in right out of the package."
2.0,"Not really worth ordering.. Shipping takes a very long time. And the quality is poor. Stringy. Basically the kind of outfit that starts falling apart, before you ever put it on."
2.0,"This wasn't what I was looking for, but the material seemed to be good quality. The top portion was itchy for the few minutes I tried it on. Cant imagine wearing it for hours like that."
2.0,I want to like this skirt.  It fits ok but the material is really weird. Its stiff and not flowy like I was hoping
2.0,I think this dress would be cuter if it were shorter.... it looks sexy on the top half and blah on the bottom.
2.0,Runs very small and the material is cheap
2.0,The case is great but the contact case & both mini bottles leak. Wish they didn't leak and it would be a 5 star review
2.0,good color and cute shirt but very small
2.0,Very cute but didn't even use. The strap broke when I grabbed the purse to try it on. I'll try to see if I can find a way to attach it again.
2.0,As soon I got it the lense was out of it frame.  :-(
2.0,"The band itself looks great, but the screw holding the band to the connector fell out within 4 days of receiving it. Too small to even fix with my eyeglasses screwdriver/kit, so I’m returning it. This was more expensive than many others on Amazon, but I guess price doesn’t equal quality."
2.0,fit good but not supportive enough.
2.0,Both watches I ordered had uneven glow Mark's at 12 oclock. Looked bad
2.0,Only good for people with very thin lips.
2.0,Nice color and texture but a hole appeared after a few uses - quality is suspect.
2.0,"Cute boots, but one broke during the first use. I glued back on the heel. The other appeared to have a glue smudge on the front."
2.0,"Shirt is definitely not as long in the bag as pictured. Also, the seams were slightly twisted so it was not manufactured well."
2.0,These gloves smells like dry fish food. I could not wear them even after a month.
2.0,"Only got 11 in my package. The package came opened but ""resealed"" with staples on one end and tape on another. The ziploc bags the masks come in (inside the small square red pouch) were all open. Not sure if that means anything, but definitely does not give me any confidence about the cleanliness of the product."
2.0,Several broken
2.0,"I was looking for a strapless bra and once i found it, I got it. First of all it was a little too tight and I got my exact size, I usually never have any issue getting my exact size. And if the straps not on the bra don’t stay up."
2.0,Very cute but the butterfly literally fell off when I removed it from the package.
2.0,"Great looking hat, but definitely not a large, I normally wear a L/XL hat and this was big enough I could tuck my ears in and still have room to spare.  Returned the hat and lost $5 on shipping and a restocking fee."
2.0,Gets tangled very easy
2.0,I ordered a small and it was still pretty big. Seems cheaply made.
2.0,The strap broke after 1 month of owning it
2.0,Terrible jeans
2.0,"Small charm, cheap chain. Would not recommend buying!"
2.0,Sent the wrong color. True to size.
2.0,Looks and feels like a cheap suit jacket. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,rings were already chipping paint when i received them
2.0,not what I thought
2.0,Kinda small for a xxl !
2.0,"I'm 5'11"" and ordered a 3XL. The shoulders fit perfect. It hits just above mid calf."
2.0,"I rarely find gloves this small, but they tear easily."
2.0,"The pendant part is nice, but the chains are very cheep quality and discolor easily.  Would be nicer with better quality chains"
2.0,really pretty but clasp doesn't latch and it always falls off.
2.0,"The band was a beautiful bold pink, but it quickly faded.  After about a month, it was two toned.  It was only exposed to sun on my daily walk.  I love the color and the band.  Good quality for the money if you don't plan to wear it daily."
2.0,they don't stay on very well
2.0,"This is advertised for kids 3-6. With that being said, I assumed that if a 6yr old could fit the shoes in the box then my 4yr old wouldn’t have a problem. She’s a size 9.5/10 toddler and she can barely get her foot into them. I can’t imagine any child over 3 safely fitting/wearing those shoes. Definitely a safety issue."
2.0,The tassle is not stable on the chain so they turn upside down after a few minutes.  Then you have to keep adjusting them.
2.0,The color red is so intense it leaves your hands red.  Don't know what kind of dye they use or if it is harmful to skin.  It will not wash off with soap until repeated hand washings.  Gloves are stiff and hard to do gardening in.  Not very happy.
2.0,The material is great but the sewing or making the mask is poor ... they all fit differently and my black when i put it on you can see the white cloth due to the way it was sewed .......... i probably wouldn’t recommend it to anyone ..... the mask should fit comfortably especially if they all the same size ... they should all fit the same way
2.0,Not crazy about the quality. It was also big. Only kept it bc my daughter liked it.
2.0,"Only 1 of the 3 I ordered actually fit. Yet all three were allegedy the same size, and labelled as such."
2.0,"Got 2g, they fit fine but don't look at all like the photos"
2.0,"Sew on buttons,really!  This was not described very well.  Not a well designed product.  I now know what to look for."
2.0,"I really like the look of this product, but it does not fit me at all. I am a 34C and I wish there was more space between the two “cups.”  The sides just barely covered my nipples. It does not look good on me at all. This would look better on someone who is very small."
2.0,Nice looking watch but the clasp is useless.  Several people have tried to get it to work but it keeps falling off.
2.0,"It runs large, so instead of fitting snug, it gathered behind the knees. Huge no no. Also just from trying it on, some threads came loose, creating holes"
2.0,"These were advertised as ""seamless"", which they are absolutely NOT seamless... Actually, the seam balls up on the inside (side) toe area. I was super hopeful when I bought these because I was thinking my 5 year old son would actually wear his socks without them bothering him. He had a pair on for about 15 seconds and right back off.. He tried again but again, took them back off quickly. A bit disappointed  :(  they are incredibly thin, which can be a good thing, but just now at all what I was expecting or hoping for. I can't tell much difference in them and a lot of other socks."
2.0,"sizes  are still to  small  to  fit,  I already  bought the XL  and still too snug fit. not comfortable."
2.0,This glass were cute but I sent them back. They didn't look right with my oval face shape. They look great and were sturdy.
2.0,"Is a great dress but run too large, and I bought small😡."
2.0,Sizing is definitely off
2.0,"When my wife first got these She was pleasantly surprised at how nice they were, having only paid $15. She took them on vacation and the very first time Shewore it the tassels frayed and became a huge mess.  At this point She hadn't even washed them so I have no idea what the issue was.  Not a bad price if She could wear them more than once."
2.0,"Fit is too tight across the bust, the waistline falls at an awkward spot, just under the bust and then flares a lot, making it look like a maternity dress. Size up if you have curves and/or a generous bust, but then be ready to have a lot of volume in the rest of the dress. It is going back."
2.0,Too small. The size chart is not correct. I went off of the chart and other reviews. Decided on a medium. It was way too small in the arms and chest area. I have an hourglass shape and weigh approximately 140. A size large would have been too big in other places. Had to return. Cute dress though.
2.0,It broke after 3 days of wearing it
2.0,These socks feel like they are made with serum in them. When I wear them I feel like I am going to slide and fall.<br />Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"This dress is very pretty and surprisingly good quality, especially considering how inexpensive it is!, however the measurements are far off. I normally wear a size 14-16 and this dress barely fit me sadly! I promptly requested a return."
2.0,"The seam was not Well  tailored, look like it was sewn by a beginner"
2.0,Loved the look of the dress however my entire backside was able to be seen way too short I am 5'8 also if the breeze even thought of blowing I would definitely be having a Marilyn Monroe moment.
2.0,CHEAP LOOKING....VERY DISAPPOINTED
2.0,This dress is darling and fits great but there is a very noticeable patch of sequins missing on the chest. Disappointed and frustrated because there is no way to hide or fix it.
2.0,Ordered these because detail stated they would come with the connecting ring. The only item that was received was the heart clasp.
2.0,"They were too small. I wear between a large and extra large. I sized up to XL, I didn’t even try getting them over my hips. I knew they would be way too tight."
2.0,"It's a great concept, but difficult to execute.  The band is hard to manage and getting the cards in and out proves difficult."
2.0,"Thin material, there is no slip under as the picture perceived. Bought it for a cruise, it’s comfortable so it’ll do for the price."
2.0,Lenses are plastic which doesn't provide a crisp view.
2.0,Cheap material. Kind of like a Halloween costume material. doesn't look as pictured.
2.0,You Have to be in shape to wear this outfit. Its thin and will show all of your cellulite
2.0,they don't have a handle on the bottom and the handle on the top has started to give away and coming  lose
2.0,"I would give this product a 5 star review but after only 1 week of having it the pocket is already coming detached from the coat at the stitching. I love the material, i ordered an extra size up and its still a wee bit smaller then id like it to be bit fits comfortably. I just like my jackets a little baggy and this one is more form fitting. Part of the reason i bought this was for the zipper pockets and with a week of moderate use of them one is already giving. So with that being said the stitching quality in the pockets isn't as good as it could be."
2.0,used size chart but still too small lovely dress though
2.0,Very disappointed with this coat
2.0,It rolls down
2.0,The button just hang not what a Button should do.
2.0,"Color was not as dark as photo shows, more of a periwinkle color.  I didn't like the top overall.  Returned."
2.0,Flimsy!  Was hard to screw back on and bent post while trying to screw it on!
2.0,Looks just as pictured and its cute.  But the zipper for the lower portion pocket broke off the track after only 1 week!
2.0,"I got this exact same dress about a year before, but outgrew it so I bought a bigger size to replace it... This one is almost an entirely different dress. It's over all a lot thinner material, which makes it sheer, while the first one was thick and comfortable. It also had pretty thick cups, and the new one has none. The photo looks a lot like the first one I had, so I feel life this one is just a cheap knock off. Overall, pretty disappointing."
2.0,The product is not as long as it is pictured.
2.0,No way the top will fit. Material feels like a bathing suit and not for anyone over a b cup
2.0,"I am 5""3 and this cardigan hangs down past my hips! I don't mind it because I like them long, but if you are average height like me and you don't like cardigans that hang down past your hips I would not recommend getting this item."
2.0,The entire sole of the left foot fell off on the literal first day wearing these. All she did was run at camp... lol.
2.0,"the item looks great and feels good,but you should order 1 or 2 sizes bigger than you usually wear.<br />I had to return it."
2.0,Rings don’t fit into end of piercing needle to slide through as you do piercing...
2.0,"I'll try to be subjective in my review of this product. The ring itself is beautiful, But the picture shown does not lend any weight to what the actual appearance is. Its somewhat deceiving., looking at the picture you dont really see the bottom of the ring. This is where the deception occurs. The shape tapers at the bottom, meaning the ring is not symmetrical all the way around, the ring is small and dainty. This is not what i thought i had purchased, im returning the merchadise for a refund"
2.0,Ordered size chart suggested but looked like a big black bag on me.  My daughter made sure I returned it! Lol
2.0,Very thin material so I do not think I will be wearing this out anywhere. Fit as expected.
2.0,Also too big
2.0,"My son tried on the bowtie once,  after that single 3 minute use it stopped working."
2.0,Be Careful...the black tie with skeletons are in sexual positions which I couldn't tell from the picture. Not ok for kids.
2.0,"Esta demasiado grande y largo para mí. La tela se me hace demasiado pesada, es probable que lo devuelva!!"
2.0,when i got it i thought it was my size but i guess not. So i donate it.
2.0,"Shirt is cute, but one wrong move and youll show alot more. Gonna return ."
2.0,You need a layer below it because the holes between the buttons open showing your body
2.0,[[VIDEOID:e31c541270233d9d7bc77db24d88e880]] Had this wallet less than a year(order date 6/2020) and zipper broke about 2 months ago. Not happy! Liked it just fine until then.
2.0,"Looks cheap. The long strap is too thin in with for a handbag size, it won't last long if you were to carry it every day."
2.0,Not at all what I'd hoped for
2.0,These are ok but not actually 9/32” like the description says.
2.0,"The clasp holding the bag and strap together broke off on BOTH sides the evening I received it, with literally almost nothing inside. It does not reattach (metal tears through the bamboo, there’s no sewing bamboo). Poor quality assembly. The bag itself is cute, so even with the two tiny side holes I kept the ribbon for my hair and used the bag as a makeup pouch instead. The strap became a backup leash. Regardless, this is way too poor quality too pass for a purse. It’s too expensive to be a small makeup bag."
2.0,"Granted this is a very inexpensive automatic watch, but the movement is terrible, losing at least 5 minutes per day. I don’t expect “certified chronometer” precision at this price, but this watch is laugbably imprecise. I’ve LITERALLY worn it 3 times because it just doesn’t keep time.<br /><br />If you want a classic Swatch look, save yourself the headache and just buy a Swatch in the classic quartz configuration."
2.0,"These tank tops arrived all different sizes, while all being tagged as size large. 2 of them fit okay, (still were different sizes) but 1 was skin tight and obviously a size too small. I don't understand how quality control could be this bad. For reference, I'm 5'11 190. 2 fit fairly loose but the other tank top would be a size medium if not small. 2 stars because 2 of the tank tops fit as described."
2.0,Dont like the finish n its way too big. Not comfortable. Very dissapointed
2.0,Not what I expected!  The beads are strung on elastic and not sterling silver chain.
2.0,"I purchase this shirt for my husband thinking that the color would be closer to red. However, the under color was more of a hot pink. Returning the shirt."
2.0,Color was much darker than advertised in the photo. Nothing neon in the shirt I received.
2.0,These are hard to put on.
2.0,My review is I'm walking around with one earring because one earring with already broken in the little container when I opened it when I first opened it
2.0,"Hurts side if my feet, to hard."
2.0,I return them
2.0,Too Narrow for Timex Expedition Field Watch.  Seller was very cool about the return; I ended up ordering the same thing but 20mm width; worked great.
2.0,Disappointed too tight and nearly cutting me
2.0,Words are not printed in the same direction.  One word is upside down from the other.  One side of the band will not lock in place.
2.0,"Don't order if you are unsure!!! I ordered this luggage piece hoping it would hold enough AND fit under an airline seat. In person, it was much smaller than I thought it would be. I had checked Seller's return policy, and it repeated Amazon's policy. HOWEVER, when I sent it back, I was hit with a $30 return shipping charge!! I repeat, buyer beware!"
2.0,Belt was too small
2.0,Fell apart after first wash and it looked horrible on. Just cheap and wouldn’t even want to wear it public
2.0,"Socks aren’t really wearable. The print stretches out and doesn’t show so much once you put shoes on. Cool if you just want them, not cool if you plan to use them."
2.0,"The material is wonderful, workmanship is nice. The size run SMALL 😢"
2.0,I didn’t like it much because.it didn’t look as good as online
2.0,"bead detail is absolutely gorgeous!!! It’s heavier than expected. The neck strap for the bra is done with Velcro, wasn’t to excited about it, but glad it worked out. As for the belt a small was ordered and a medium was sent, a friend also bought the same one in the orange color belt was a medium as well, and color of the skirt was more gold than orange. Def a great piece but not for the price."
2.0,"The tension spring is weak. Also, I used the shoe size chart that was provided to determine which size of shoe tree to purchase and it turns out they don’t fit and fill the shoe very well based on their chart."
2.0,Too small and slides off head easily.
2.0,Too small and thin material for my needs
2.0,"engraving so small you can hardly read it.  disappointed.  picture was so different, very deceiving"
2.0,"I did not realize this is cut like a Poncho. It is open on both sides. Material felt like cheap vinyl or a thin plastic tablecloth. Looked too wide on me. It would probably dry quickly though because it is so thin and plastic like, which is a plus. Returned immediately."
2.0,This stinks.  Letting air out then will wash.  Took forever to receive.  Shouldnt take a month to get a sweater from Anazon or Lands End. Very disappointed with quality and servive.
2.0,"The sole is nice and sturdy, but my feet swam around inside, sometimes going over the soles.  They went back."
2.0,Hard to breath and caused a break out
2.0,"I have to say that even thou I like this mask, it is very hard to breath with. I will not recommend.  Hopefully they will improve the design to make it easier to breath by providing perhaps more space in the nose to mouth area."
2.0,Very tight fit for my little readers.
2.0,"Works as promised. Since I only received 1 out of 2, and the unresponsiveness of the seller to my request for 2nd item, would recommend buying from someone else."
2.0,"Thin material, not a thick thermal.  Go a size up, they run a bit small."
2.0,"It’s cute, genuinely it is, and I’m gonna keep it and wear it, but it literally isn’t what was advertised. It’s a dress not a romper, and the straps aren’t adjustable, they don’t have any sort of bow on them, there’s one pocket… just see the picture. Cute, but wtf? Maybe it’s just this color? I ordered a small purple. I don’t know if some colors are right and some aren’t, but… this ain’t it. Be wary."
2.0,Not as cute as it looks.  No chest support for larger women
2.0,"Gave my son blisters, but he likes them anyway. They are really cute, but the material is just very plasticy"
2.0,Cute but bad quality
2.0,It’s bad enough that I had to glue them myself but to make it all worse I didn’t even get my pink flower charm that’s the one I wanted the most
2.0,"La sudadera es bonita , no tengo ninguna queja, es sólo que me quedó muy grande y no soy de usar ropa floja."
2.0,"I would give them more than 2 stars because they look pretty nice for the price and fit well, but the product description says they are polarized when they are definitely not polarized."
2.0,It was a nice soft band but much smaller than the large band the Charge 2 originally comes with. It should be offered in a bigger size also.
2.0,"Just ok...nothing like picture. Thin, material very cheap,  and a bit to long then I was expecting."
2.0,"I am a 32 D everywhere I shop, so I ordered a 32 D. The cups are too large and the band is too loose."
2.0,These are low quality. After first wash there was threads everywhere.
2.0,This product comes in a light gray not dark gray as advertised.
2.0,Screen print realy shiny to where looks like may even come off.
2.0,"Pulled it out of the packaging and tried to unzip it to remove the strap from inside and attach it, the fabric from the inside of the purse was bunched up all in the zipper. Tried for 20 minutes to unzip, finally the zipper just busted and now I have a cute purse the doesnt zip. Otherwise, would have been perfect."
2.0,"The only good thing about these are how soft they are. I wore them ONCE and washed them. Went to put them on for the SECOND time and there were four spots where the seams were undone. One under the waist band, one on the left leg, one on the right, and one in the crotch area. Also there is absolutely no tummy control. The elastic band in the waist is narrow. I returned these garbage pants. The price really does determine the quality."
2.0,"Poor quality and fit, Returned item. Was not flattering."
2.0,Small. Cheap made. And you cannot return it
2.0,Very disappointed. I ordered a black pair and absolutely loved them so I ordered the ink blue and  was looking forward to get them. When they got delivered they actually were purple. I really loved the blue color that was listed but instead got purple. Very unhappy wish it was blue 😭
2.0,"They are cute but not smooth and I have got it caught on a washcloth and ripped it out, got it caught on my pillowcase and ripped it out! So I recommend not for long term use."
2.0,"So compact to keep cards, cash and visiting card."
2.0,Shoulders didn't stay up.  Wish you could tighten them more.
2.0,2 mths of wear..tarnished badly ..can't clean it ..would not buy again
2.0,"Ordered these for out of country friends, sadly they are super cheap looking."
2.0,Way too big. Can't even tie it tighter to make it fit. Too wide.
2.0,"The skull ring got STUCK in my nose. I actually had to go to the ER and get it removed, like they had to bend the metal for it to become undone. Also not all of these rings are hypoallergenic (Hence me going to the ER my nose was swollen from being allergic to the metal and my nose was so sensitive they had to numb my nose in order to take it out)."
2.0,These sweatbands seem nice enough. I was aiming for adult sized though. There was nothing in the product description that indicated that these are actually for kids. I’ll be returning them and hope someone will update the product description.
2.0,Everything broke in a week.
2.0,"Very scratchy polyester like material. No shape, very wide. Definitely not cotton like most tee shirts are."
2.0,It's okay so long as you don't have to wash it. I have a handwash setting on my washer and it unraveled. The ribbon that is at the waste is garbage.
2.0,The shorts underneath are very cheaply made and very short!  They ride up with every movement.
2.0,"The sleeves were uneven - one was much longer then the other one and it is really obvious, the material was cheap and hot; I would not purchase again and unfortunately, I bought two of them."
2.0,"This is described as sexy. I would not call it sexy at all. I wear an 8-10 and ordered a medium. It barely wrapped around me. Also I ordered the purple. It is so dark, it almost looks black"
2.0,One fit perfectly however the other two (the same size) were much tighter
2.0,For the money they are comfortable but poor quality. After just the first wash the stitching became loose and stringy in several places. Dont waist your money. They should be cheaper. Go with name brand.
2.0,Beautiful look but inside lining feels like paper.
2.0,My dad liked it but it wasn't the right shirt it said something completely different. Very disappointed
2.0,Colors look completely different.
2.0,These are very tight and really hard to get on. Plus I have a ring around my leg below my knee and it started to hurt really bad within an hour of wearing them. I don't have big calf muscles either.
2.0,"Sunglasses are way too tight. They push into my head. If someone has a small head, they might fit great. Also, had to pay almost as much as the glasses to return them."
2.0,Straps are way too long
2.0,"It came on time any everything but it isn't as long as it looks in the picture I'm 5'3 and it barely hit below my knees. Also it's not a flowly fabric at all it's a very stiff stretchy fabric, seems more cheaply made then what's in the picture. 2/10 would not recommend"
2.0,"These socks aren't very thick, not warm at all, and the elastic seems shot. They feel like a thin sheet. After wearing around the house for just a few minutes, the socks are stretched and almost falling off. They are soft, but they're not functional. They don't stay on my feet or provide any warmth."
2.0,"Came earlier then expected. At first I liked it when I opened it, but it has a strange smell and is also an Xl when I ordered a L so it's bigger then I would like. The sleeves also have a few rippes like the lace wasn't sewn right. The lace is also a. Bit darker in some areas and light in others like two different colors of thread was used. But, I can't be too disappointed bc you get what you pay for. It's really cute, I will just have to fix the holes and take it in on the sides. I'm also not sure how to wash it and get the Odor out.... So we will see how that goes... Bottom line- it's cute but you would be better off spending your money on something of better quality."
2.0,"This hat was advertised on Amazon as an ""oversized beanie cap.""  Definitely. Not. Slouchy. Otherwise the cap seems well made.<br /> This is my second purchase with Zando, whom I thought was an up and coming South African company (and I assumed they produced their clothing in South Africa as well).  After reading about human rights violations in China, I have been looking to buy clothing made elsewhere in verifiable non-slave labor economies.  So I was doubly disappointed to find that this undersized ""slouchy"" beanie distributed by Zando was also made in China.  Aren't there local production sources in South Africa who need employment?  As a further note to Amazon shoppers, Amazon puts NO apparent restrictions on vendors as to the ethics of their production practices.  I called customer service to find out whether they had any such regulations in place and was shuffled to three different representatives.  Finally I was told to send an email...which never got answered.  Amazon does not care either."
2.0,"Its okay, but not intuitive in its operation.  I don't like the ruberized straps, they are a pain to adjust."
2.0,"I gave it two stars because it’s pretty, however, the clock is running slow and I’ve only had it 3 hours :("
2.0,"Received the watch, wound it, set the time, shortened the watchband so it would fit and put it on.<br />For 3 hours it kept perfect time.  Then I shook my hands off after washing them and the watch stopped cold.<br />Never realized it was not shock-proof.  Seventeen dollars down the drain."
2.0,Disappointed in this dress because the front and back are different materials. Didn’t return but will not wear it again.
2.0,"First, this is not a sweatshirt, it’s sweatshirt-ish. The fabric is very thin, like t-shirt thin, and doesn’t fit at the waist like you’d expect a sweatshirt to do.  Second, the picture in the ad makes the blue seem a bit more subdued, but the actual color is a very bright blue, the 20% spandex likely the cause of the “shine” coming off this thing."
2.0,Absolutely runs so small I'm a 36c cup and wear a lg or xl this thing could fit a child
2.0,When I received it in the mail it honestly look very pretty. But after two days of wearing the belly ring it started to turn black. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Cute, but didn't fit my face. Too big."
2.0,"Uncomfortable and cheap-feeling.  Didn’t like the way the rubber sticky part felt on my thigh to keep the shorts in place.  The padding was huge.  Keep in mind I’m a beginner when it comes to this, but I’ve tried other pairs and they did not feel this awkward.  I sized up from my usual size and it fit fine in terms of not being too tight or too loose.  The materials just didn’t feel right texture wise and the padding was so uncomfortable.  Will be returning."
2.0,"Cheap and shoddy in appearance when compared to OTTO hats.  Also, similarly priced and that's the real burn regarding the purchase of this hat."
2.0,Too small way cute tho
2.0,Ended up returning it. Wasn't as nice of a material as I was expecting.
2.0,I wear a medium and I could hardly get the top on and the bottoms were uncomfortably tight
2.0,I wanted red and I got black
2.0,Poorly made. This shirt arrived with the top unraveling.
2.0,It's almost hard to tell from taking a picture but the design is terrible in how it printed. One of the few times I wish my camera didn't clean up images! It's blurry and looks like I bought it at the dollar store and still overpaid.
2.0,Decal instead of stitching. Very small decal. Can't read it from 2 ft away. Gave it away. I will never buy from this dealer again.
2.0,"Looks lovely, but unfortunately, came with a broken chain. One side was completely detached and pieces of the chain were laying at the bottom of the package. If you have the time and tools to fix it, this might not be a bad buy. If not, I'd say skip it."
2.0,Assumed bottoms would have some support to hold in tummy and more lining.  Also for the top edges on bottom are frail to unraveling
2.0,Easily slips off.
2.0,Super annoying. It doesn’t keep shape. Always looks awkward because the liner moves so much and separates from the outside layer. Would not recommend.
2.0,"I ordered a small (I’m 5’4, 125 lbs) and it fit great everywhere except my hips. It’s like the curse for the hips come up too high."
2.0,Cute but didn’t really work for me
2.0,"Shirt is very short in the front, does not go down to waist and is wayy too tight for an xl."
2.0,"The glasses fit well and provided ample UV protection, but they are not very sturdy. I used them for driving to and from work, so I got in the car, put them on, drove to work, and put them back in my car's compartment for sunglasses; they have had an easy life. Unfortunately, as I was putting them on this morning, the right arm of the sunglasses snapped near the lens, and they are now broken. I expected more than 5 or 6 months out of a pair of sunglasses, especially when they have been treated so carefully."
2.0,"Followed all of the special requirements for custom tailoring...answered all the questions for the seller and emailed them via amazon -asked for euro size 39 but received 36....stickers were placed over the stamped size on bottom that had been scraped or cut away-? Disappointed as they would have completed the costume.  Stitching on the one boot was already coming out :(  Boots smelled terrible like all of the other comments.  Ok boots for the price and purpose, just way too small.... Not the size I ordered!!!!!"
2.0,"In the picture the shirt was exactly what I was looking for. When I received it, it didn’t look like the picture. So I tried it on it just didn’t look right on me. Very boxy on me and clingy. I wanted a loose & flowy top and this was not it. Don’t like and I can’t wear it so I’ll donate it because I missed the window to return it"
2.0,"I really wanted this to work but I actually think it is a dangerous product.  I put them on two of my hens.  They both hated it, and kept trying to get it off.  One managed to get the elastic that goes around the neck between her beak so she couldn't close her beak.  I think it would also get caught on things.  Nice idea, but I won't risk my girls.  The reason I gave it two stars was that the product itself is well made, sturdy and cute."
2.0,"the fit was as expected. pretty design. but, the fabric is HORRIBLE.  super- thick swimsuit fabric. like wearing rubber. so thick it doesnt drape or flow at all, skirt just sticks straight out. so unflattering. even tho is was not too small at all, I felt so trapped and claustrophobic  I couldnt get if off and into the donation bag fast enough."
2.0,"Ordered XL, way too small. Mire like medium. Otherwise nice quality, but had to give away."
2.0,Got this for a dear friend of mine. Who I won’t see during birthday due to well...covid. Wanted her to chill as she recovered...but the material was not as expected and she didn’t expect the hoodie to last longer than 4months. She describe very poor quality and she said if I paid anything over $10 it was too much for quality
2.0,this elastic is to tight & it's irritating around the nape & the material is to thin & hot.
2.0,These were heavy and pulled my ears.
2.0,Do not buy this in my opinion for $75 it was not worth it I've gotten other ones necklaces Swartz crystals that were higher quality and looked better than this for $30
2.0,"It's super thin - you can see through it. Also even though I bought the roomiest one, it doesn't flow well over my other garments."
2.0,Poor quality material.. this dress is just okay. i dont think i will be purchasing from this brand again..
2.0,It's way to thin for my liking.
2.0,"I bought these to wear under my CAM boot, however, I could really feel the texture of these socks pressing against my wide calf. I also had to put pressure on my knee because I used a knee scooter to get around and I was hoping these would provide extra comfort near my knee since they were so stretchy, but they were very uncomfortable and I could feel the material pressing against my skin, they weren’t soft. They are very stretchy though, but ironically I returned these and used some other knee high socks that I had used for my Halloween costume months prior because they were softer/super stretchy over my large calf and didn’t press into my skin with an uncomfortable texture like these particular socks (the socks I ended up using were the Joulli womens knee high tube socks, they worked well with my cam boot)."
2.0,Bracelet cracked after a few wears
2.0,It's a cute dress but the stitch isn't high quality and the material is way too thin. I thought it would be thicker. It's a very light material and the top is stretchy.
2.0,"top tore after one week, its too bad the fit was GREAT!!"
2.0,It’s like it’s too big and too small at the same time. It’s too tight to be such a slouchy styled hat.
2.0,"I've been searching for a dress for a special event. I've tried on five so far, and this one is the only one that's been way off on the sizing. I generally wear an XL, but due to being larger chested I've been ordering dresses in 2XL. This dress is so tiny I couldn't even get a 2XL onto my body. It's cute, but I would recommend ordering up probably 2-3 sizes to even be able to get it on."
2.0,"Not great quality, price was too high for such a disappointing item. Decided to return. They fit a little too snug and the button was on the wrong side (I guess there's a male and female side for buttons). Wouldn't recommend this brand"
2.0,"I guess these are sewn by hand-I can't imagine a robotic machine sewing this choppy.  The outside contour should look smooth, but as you can see by the picture, it goes out and in."
2.0,Wanted this for a skeleton costume.  They are bright green and the details that were on the picture online are not there
2.0,Very small..only two of them fit my finger.
2.0,poor qaulity
2.0,Not I expected disappointed
2.0,"Sorry to say, but the plastic inside got brittle after a couple of months and then broke."
2.0,Smaller than the picture makes it look
2.0,"XL equivalent to L which makes the gloves tight.  No where in the product page does it mention &#34;SKI GLOVES&#34; which was printed on the glove package with a skier.  It does mention &#34;CYCLING&#34; for which I bought them.  But, again, there are mentions by others there is no warmth so they really wouldn't be good for SKIING or CYCLING in the winter months."
2.0,"I wanted this dress to work sooo much but it did not fit right on top. there was not enough room around the chest area for my cup size (36 D) and then the top hem around my arm pits gapped regardless of how I adjusted the straps. So, this dress is on its way back to the warehouse. I loved the high-low bottom and the flowy cut, even though I'm 5' it wasn't too long."
2.0,"They are not very good quality. If you are going to use them to do some work around the yard I don't think they will make it thru the day. The pair I received started falling apart once I put them on. If you wanted to use as regular gloves, I would not recomend because they are not very warm and are kind of bulky."
2.0,"Got this for my 9 year old son to help with beeping/vibrating reminders; very effective. Now has reset and condensation inside display after swimming lessons. For a $40- watch that claims to be 30 m water resistant, this is unacceptable even by 1980's standards. Looking for a multiple alarm alternative."
2.0,It is a cute anklet with a nice patina to the silver. It didn't look cheap but I wore it once and the links broke so that it can't be repaired.
2.0,A little to tight in the shoulders and hip. Material a little to heavy
2.0,The product size was incorrect.  When I received it we measured the case and it is 13 x 17.  I cannot accomodate what I wanted to put in the case.  I am VERY disappointed because it was totally misleading.  Please make this right.
2.0,The jewels slip out pretty easy. Definitely don't eat or sleep with them in.
2.0,No es como en la foto
2.0,The Material wasn’t what I expected and it was way too small
2.0,The sizes run a little big
2.0,She usually use one size but it didn't work I'll need to buy next size.
2.0,"This mask is too tight for me. I wear a size 7 hat which is considered small. The product is well made and the printed image quality is good. However, if you look closely at the pictures showing what it looks like you can see they edited them to give the illusion the mask conforms to your face. It does not. It is a tube of fabric with an elastic drawstring it at the top. It is flat across the top. It does not conform to your nose or curve down to accommodate your eyes. To stay over your ears, the front cuts across the eyes. Perhaps if it were larger, it could have enough slack to drape down below the eyes. But, it is too tight for that. Perhaps it is sized for children."
2.0,"Not a fan. The empty bag itself was so heavy, I wasn't sure I'd even want to put much in it. It's loose and floppy, there's no support in the bag, not even in the bottom. The straps on the sides are awkward and stick out and if you tighten them, it throws off the rest of the bag. It's just not a good bag unfortunately. I'm glad this had free returns so I don't have to pay to send it back."
2.0,"Looks nice but I've had it pop off the watch twice. Once while mountain biking, the other while trail running. These instances were both within the first week of using the band, compared to almost a year with the garmin and no such occurrences."
2.0,way too big for my ear
2.0,"Very pretty, but runs large, especially in the bust."
2.0,No traction on the bottom. More for non walker.
2.0,Was not as pictured and too small
2.0,This is TINY. And CHEAP. but it's orange and wrinkle free. But very small. No idea what I'm going to use this for.
2.0,Gosh this was so cute! I bought it for my tragus. It was awesome I got so many compliments. Then a few days later it was gone. Just popped off ! It was screwed in but I think the rivets weren’t long enough and any bump to it would unscrew it.
2.0,Price should have been half of what it is. The chain was so very thin. The stone was almost invisible to naked eye. Arrived late but I think this was Amazon's fault nothing related to product. I don't suggest this product.
2.0,They do not stay in your nose. They fall out too easy
2.0,Not a one size fits all situation.
2.0,"I didn't like the material of the top part. I think I could've made it work with a cardigan, but ultimately I returned this item.  I didn't feel that it would hold up longterm."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but when I got it, the sizing was just all wrong. It was not form-fitting whatsoever and really loose around the waist. Clearly, the model has her hand there to make it appear tighter. On top of that, it was extremely short! So picture, my butt hanging out of a wide baggy dress. Hmm not attractive. I wouldn't be able to exchange for another size because it just doesn't work.<br /><br />It seemed to be good quality and is very pretty though."
2.0,Weird boxy fit with a shorter torso than pictured. Dissappointing and unflattering.
2.0,Is seethrough is really hard to sippered up also around the arms is really tight. Really cute color tho
2.0,The Customized part fell off within the first few weeks. It is also not engraved but more so printed and the stainless steel seems fake as well. It has a cloudy look to it.
2.0,Nice quality fabric but more tent sized than large women's size.  Had to return
2.0,Took too long to get it and poor quality
2.0,The shirt is smaller than expected.
2.0,Very thin material and stitching
2.0,Zipper broke putting this on. Cute dress otherwise. Definitely very short.
2.0,"While the styling is nice, this is very cheaply made.  Of course, the price reflects that too so I guess you get what you pay for.  I don't see how this would hold up at all through normal use let alone a wash cycle unless you put it in a lingerie bag.  Even then, I'm not sure if it would hold up.  The straps are 1/4"" elastic, and are not adjustable.  the seams are poorly sewn and the hem, well it was just a stitched raw edge.  This would be fine for a one-occasion usage, but plan to toss after that."
2.0,"I wanted to love this shirt. But the shoulders were huge, and the waist was tiny. It fit more like a man's shirt, but still super narrow at the waist. Sadly disappointed, and definitely returning."
2.0,"I bought these as I teach a class with a hearing impaired student. I was hoping that this would allow her to lip read, if necessary. They were a disappointment. They fogged up. The vinyl is thick and makes it hard to breathe. In my opinion they are not worth ordering. I never used them after the first time."
2.0,The back seam ripped and the fabric frayed after wearing it 3 times.  Love the dress but now it looks mended because of loss of the material.
2.0,I bought this for a music festival but the triangle parts of the top failed to keep my boobs intact lol and alot of side boob was the result so i had to find something else in my closet to wear unfortunately.
2.0,"About the correct size as described, but the opening is MUCH smaller than the bag size!  Unusable for any practical purpose.  None of the photos show it, but there is a HUGE flap that covers the opening - the flap covers the entire side of the bag and must be drawn up through the strap to access the inside.  The opening is then closed by a zipper, but the material is drawn together  in such a manner as to make the opening very inconvenient.  If you are looking for security, this bag is it!  Nothing will ever fall out of it!  The 2&#34; width advertised is accomplished by unzipping an expansion zipper on the 3 edges, which then leaves an exposed zipper to catch on your sweater.  AND the 2&#34; expansion DOES NOT include the opening!  Had to send it back."
2.0,I will admit my son who is 3.5 is larger than most kids his age.  But these masks are terribly too small around the ears.  They pull his ears so they basically flap down.  Ouch how uncomfortable !<br /><br />Gave a 2 star bc they are cute
2.0,"I disliked that fact that they roll down with every step. Where are the pockets located?<br />They came down with every step as well, with my underwear coming along with them. I spent the entire time pulling them back up."
2.0,Too small for an XL for their sizes of dress
2.0,Is Very wide
2.0,I love the color. Ordered according to the size chart and it was way too big.
2.0,Poor design in my opinion
2.0,"Some of them work well but they break too easy  and one even got stuck in my ear, overall I wouldn’t really suggest them."
2.0,I love the bands but never got the face app to work after trying for several days.
2.0,Received the hat on time.  I tried it on and it fit a bit tighter than expected.  My wife said it looks like a woman's hat.......so I gave it to her!
2.0,"Hoping it would give back support, it doesn't."
2.0,These clip-ons are quite attractive but stones came loose and fell out during the first wearing.  Returned the first set but the same thing happened with the replacement.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Smallest size you sell, the heel goes up behind the ankle. I bought them for my wife. Her feet are still cold and seems colder."
2.0,It changes color... and i haven't even worn it out yet.
2.0,A bit disapointed :(
2.0,"This is a really cute band, but I’ve never had the chance to wear it because I received a defective one. I contact the seller for an exchanged and accused me of not putting it on right and possibly bought the wrong band for my watch. Thanks to Amazon they allowed me to return it without any issues."
2.0,made of cheap metal turn fingers black but it was cheap so buyer be warned
2.0,"Poor quality, very small, not the right color - returned."
2.0,"Love the pattern but didn't realize how much smaller these would be than the solid black, navy and blue. I  assume the material is what makes the difference. The solids have a higher percentage of nylon."
2.0,"Not as good as in-store, or at least I got a bad item. Felt cheaper, too tight, more inflexible, way uncomfortable when compared to the in-store item I tried (same make/model/size). This is the 3rd time I bought online for footwear, and all 3 times weren't worth the risk. It's 12 dollars less than what's in-store, but it's not worth it for the discomfort."
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Definitly costume jewelry - will probably return
2.0,Not very durable and guarantee is very conditional
2.0,Ibwoi have left a five star rating. I didn't because j had to order 3 pair to get the size right. I am normally a size 10.5-11. I ordered 10.5 huge. Then I ordered size10 still huge. Finally I ordered a 9 1/2<br />They fit perfectly and are comfortable
2.0,My first picture shows how it’s not fitted at all in the underboob area and just falls straight down to your belly. Second picture I’m pulling it tight to how it should look. Third picture shows it’s literally just sewn in a square shape. Not sure how many women are shaped like that.
2.0,I read reviews and persons complained they were to small n tight etc. So I generally wear nine in heals no nine was available so I bought 10 the only othe option plus they saud it would be 5..% small so I had my hopes up how ever I really need them fr my bday n so Istuffed tthem n this is hw they look..
2.0,I wear a size 12 and I need about 12.5 - 13 so I'm returning for a bigger size
2.0,I love the color and material but it runs way to small I usually wear a medium I ordered a large and the sleeves are skin tight and it barely covers my butt.
2.0,"Their ok a little big for my face, but they’ll be ok"
2.0,"The Everest band does not fit flush on the curved end side. From the pictures I see from other buyers the band looks flush, but not the one that I received. I am very disappointed for the price that I paid. The rubber quality itself is okay for the price. The rubber does not attach lint but it is very sticky. My main complain is that it does not fit flush."
2.0,"I’m 5’5, 130 pounds & I am a huge fan of rippling in a dress. I was so excited to try this on- I got it for a baby shower & was really disappointed when it magnified my stomach. It looked like I had just eaten a bucket of KFC chicken all to myself :/ this might look better on a super petite person. Im gonna keep it though as a maternity dress."
2.0,"It has a perfect fit and superior material, however I encountered a problem on every piece of my last purchase. There was a loose sewing in the same area of the shirt."
2.0,Is really pretty but it came folded in a way that it left a mark on the hat.
2.0,"I’ve carried this backpack for 3 months, usually carrying two small laptops inside. The stitching has come apart at one of the seams. Just glad it didn’t completely give way with my laptops inside. I’ll find a different brand to replace it with."
2.0,You can tell fabric is cheap and is soft/thin. Wasn’t as cute on as I was hoping.
2.0,"The packaging of that watch is very bad, good for 3 dollars is fine. At least you could put it in a box. Because of that the screen has been broken."
2.0,"This shirt had sleeves 6 inches too long, longer than an identical shirt bought at the same time. Also real Western shirts have a pencil slot in the pocket fold. These Chinese versions don't. Quality control was poor. My husband had to do lots of tailoring."
2.0,I was in hospital in Houston for 12 days and did not have help to return to the shoes. Is there a way to return them now?  They are just not my style but love your brand.
2.0,Is messed up after daily wear for a month. Cheaply made.
2.0,Not too great
2.0,Super cute shirt but came very small. So order a size or two up. I returned it so can’t say how it washed but it was pretty thin
2.0,Doesn’t really look like the picture. The flag is not at all faded like shown here. And the fit is really weird. Overall I’m a little disappointed.
2.0,"Was supposed to be 24 earrings, there were only 17. No pearls, half the diamonds, only some match😑"
2.0,"I was disappointed with this dress after thinking it looked so cute in the picture. I am 5'3, 150 lbs, DD bra size, and size 8 pants and I ordered this dress in a large. It hits me about an inch above my knees, but I was hoping it would be a little longer. The chest fit great, so if you are smaller chested this won't work for you. The fabric is thin and extremely staticky/clingy. Overall, I got what I paid for which wasn't much. So disappointed!🙁"
2.0,"It is a pretty top but sleeves are too short. They do not go to the wrists like in the picture.  The rest of the top fits, but unfortunately I will have to keep sleeves rolled up since because they look silly down."
2.0,This jacket is very nice and I really do like it. The unacceptable part is the logo!  The logo on this jacket resembles camel cigarettes! I tried but I just couldn’t bring myself to wear a jacket that every time I looked at the logo I felt I was wearing some cheap promotional gear earned by turning in barcodes to the vendor. I considered placing a patch over the logo but then felt I shouldn’t need to go through this trouble and decided to return it. It is a shame because I love everything about the jacket but this and I just can’t get over it! Please re-work your logo!!!!
2.0,Very oversized.
2.0,"They were cute but the elastic string has a big knot that was right on the top/front of my baby's foot and looked odd, so we sent them back"
2.0,"The outfit itsself is super cute. The fabric could definitely be softer. (Even after 3 washes, the inside fabric feels a bit scratchy). The pants are about 12 inches too long and balloon puff so they look ridiculous when paired with the top which runs probably a whole size too small. I had to roll the pants up 3x and the fabric, being velour, did not stay up and my daughter kept tripping and falling over the pant legs. My daughter is very tall, lean so I bought 12 months. My daughter was a preemie and at 12 months old currently, is on the lower end of weight for her age group. I needed the outfit to fit now, which is why I didn't buy a size up like I do any other time. Really wish the pants fit better because the pattern really is super cute."
2.0,the material is thin and cheap looking!  Its definitely NOT as expected
2.0,"I really don't like having to write a negative review when I have gotten so many fantastic pieces of jewelry from this seller, but this piece was very disappointing. It's missing a bead entirely so one side doesn't look like the other side. The beads are also not set in place so they tend to slide around. It doesn't sit very well on the wrist and it just looks very unfinished. The ends are pretty rough. I do like the color of the leather and the braided look. The infinity symbol is also well placed and I like the curves. I also really like the slip knot that allows it to be very easily adjustable for wrist size. So, there are definitely some positives about this bracelet, but they don't outweigh the negatives. I will continue to purchase from this seller and this doesn't tarnish my relationship with them, but I don't recommend this bracelet. I received it at a discount in exchange for my completely honest review."
2.0,Runs slightly small. Not recommended for women with a big chest. It looked horrible on.
2.0,Cheap thin socks that get holes after washing. Also fits very small
2.0,"Because the metal clamp is heavier than the fringe and they are dangling from a chain, they’re just gonna always flip upside down. It’s a poor design.<br /><br />Upshot: they look like lil tacos and are still cute upside down."
2.0,"I did not care for this, it was sturdy but didn't give enough runs small"
2.0,bad shape
2.0,Material almost feels like a tent cover. It's awful. That way the straps are makes it impossibly to take off and on to use the bathroom without having to restring through all straps. I had to use tweezers to feed the strings through to even get it on and they fall out every time you take it off. I'd never survive a night out in this.
2.0,The shirt had a horrible smell.
2.0,Fits good overall but unfortunately the sleeves are too short.  Very noticeable
2.0,Broke on first try to put it on
2.0,Color Blue Moon. I thought marks on these capris were just deep creases so I pulled off the tags and put them in a cold wash. The marks were still there so I went ahead with a warm wash and added a color run sheet. No color bled on color catch sheet but the marks are still there. I wish I had trusted my gut and just returned them. It looks like they were folded while damp and the color has stayed darker in some of the fold lines.<br /><br />The fit is great. I haven’t worked out in them yet but they feel very comfortable.
2.0,Didn't last a year before the strap started breaking. I think it was about 4 months of owning this before the strap started to tear. I did like the size but that was about it. Sad.
2.0,"Unfortunately I will be returning the yellow dress I bought, because it's see-through. Have two stars, cause I like the fitting."
2.0,"Very cute dress, however I had it on for two hours and it ripped. It did not rip on anything, the fabric was jut very thin. It is not fixable, so it is unwearable now. Very disappointing."
2.0,Good deal but very small. I think should be advertised as kids or woman's glove
2.0,Fine but too small.
2.0,"I liked it a lot, it just was not the correct earring to fit in my tragus where I needed it to go in my ear."
2.0,We’ve had these shoes for a total of 33 days. My son loves them they are wide and for a kid with sensory issues we loved the fit.<br />Unfortunately these are not hard wearing on the inside. You can see from the photos that the inner sole tore and wore down in a short period of time.<br />Disappointing given the outside of the shoe is great.
2.0,"Cheaply made which was expected but what was not was all the threads that were exposed and hanging from it. The fit was weird and pulled tight right across the top of my boobs forcing them to be squished downwards.  Cute pattern and idea, probabaly would fit better on a smaller person (I am 5'5&#34; and size 14)"
2.0,Was so tight I had difficulty getting it off. Going to see if it fits my teenager.
2.0,"I loved the material, dress fit nice but zipper construction was horrible. I was at a party when the zipper decided to separate. very embarrassing"
2.0,"it was a very loose fit, and I might have considered trying to work with it if they'd remembered to include the straps (they did not), so there was no way to wear it (it just slid down).  Even if it had had straps, though, despite being so large on me, the seamed cubs were bizarrely small - like way smaller than my actual, non-huge breasts, which was very weird.  I cannot imagine anyone big enough to fill out that dress being totally flat and wanting it highlighted with white seams..."
2.0,"I ordered this skirt because I liked the look of the waistband. What I received wasn't what I was expecting. At the top of the skirt, is a very thin piece of elastic - about the size of a rubber band in width. I never have a problem with waist sizes - generally if a garment is tight on me, it is tight in the hips. This skirt fit fine everywhere (in fact, it was a little loose) except the waist, which was uncomfortable and pinched. I decide it to return it, because it was prime. However, the return label that automatically printed was not prepaid. I am waiting for the seller to respond since I don't want to keep an uncomfortable skirt that I will not wear."
2.0,Sleeves had elastic which would be very uncomfortable sleeping so I returned them.
2.0,Too elastic and pulling up of waist line as you move your arms. Not as good for the golf round.
2.0,Was not leather.  Little disappointed<br />  And the ring holding the clippers very thin. Won't last
2.0,More like a shirt and material was very cheap
2.0,Quite flimsy compared to the other heavy duty rings I had purchased. Ordered these because the price per unit was better.<br /><br />You get what you pay for. A thin flimsy ring that I'd be afraid to put much pressure on.<br /><br />Spend the extra few cents per unit and get actual HEAVY duty rings elsewhere.
2.0,"Small, lightweight,flat engraving (no texture )"
2.0,I expected the deer print to be on the entire scarf like in the picture. Instead there’s a section that’s striped. The material isn’t as good a quality as other scarfs I have purchased from this company. Would not recommend.
2.0,No because the sock is large never help
2.0,"Cute and exactly what I wanted... However one of the ""gems"" in the eyes came out within minutes"
2.0,The boots come with the wide flat laces that do not freely move through the eyelets. This is also a problem because the eyelets are 2 inches apart and have to much tounge in between. This meens the laces are to short and don't move easily through the the eyelets. You have to lace the boots up every time you put them on.  This is listed as a tactical boot. In my mind a tactical boot should go on quick and have durable laces not the crappy flat laces that you see on kids sketchers. I tried swapping them out for proper 96 inch boot laces and the eyelets are so far apart that they run short and won't work. Another fine example of a &#34;tactical&#34; boot clearly designed by civilians. Returning
2.0,Product quality did not look as mentioned plus the sleeves were not as shown.  I don't have time to return it so I'll keep it just because but it was very disappointing
2.0,So I ordered a 3x and these definitely run small also they are very long a little too long and it rolls up and doesn't stay in place
2.0,Cheap :/ broke after 2 days. Very cute though!
2.0,"They are pretty earrings, but without having a rubber backing fall out all the time. Lost one in the shower drain yesterday so yeah, guess were nice for a week that had them."
2.0,I ordered assortment #3 and it came with 2 of the same and no dragonfly inn one. Super disappointed.
2.0,I bought this fir my wedding and it is way smaller than I expected…my nephew is 6 and it’s too small for him…also the glasses came broken so I’ll be sending it back
2.0,Lenses are loose in the frame.
2.0,The coat I received is not the one showing on the picture.  Very disappointing!  I should have listened to other reviews.
2.0,Started to fry at the bottom seam on the outside on first use... cute otherwise
2.0,Is 🤷🏻‍♀️
2.0,Not heavy duty
2.0,"After just 4 months of moderate use, the zipper broke, poor quality."
2.0,Pretty upset the straps were wide and the shoes slipped off way to easily very dangerous
2.0,La tela es licra y solo una persona muy fit podría usar ese tipo de vestido sin verse mal
2.0,Only one earring and it took FOREVER to get it.  It is kind of cheap looking.
2.0,The bottoms
2.0,I've ordered these hats and have been pleased at times but the last time the hat was sewn together wrong. The bill was extremely curved and it was sewn in a manner that made it look off. Hard to explain it other than to say if you get one of these blems you will know what I mean.
2.0,"I love the dress a lot (the main part of this costume), but the belt and leggings are too small. Sadly, I’ll be returning this set. I wish I could order the items separately because the dress fits almost perfect.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5’3 and 160 lbs. I guess I have a weird shape compared to the norm? :("
2.0,"I really wanted to love this, however, as with so many things in the marketplace represented by digital images, what you see is not what you get.<br />-The emblem is placed lower in the corner folds of the mask and is barely recognizable.<br />-The mask is way too big and unusable when fully opened.<br />- Looks stupid when worn.<br />+ Awesome material and filter arrangement."
2.0,It is cheap material and runs small.  I would order a size up.  If you have remotely long arms the sleeves will be too short.
2.0,"I was torn over giving this 1 or 2 stars. As is, it's 1 star, for sure. The print is vibrant and super cute (I got the unicorns), but that's about it. It literally does not stretch. Like at all. Not even a little bit. No way could I possibly get this over my head, much less use it as a mask, or a headband, or whatever. It might fit a child, but even then, without the stretchiness, what's the point of the item at all?<br /><br />However, I was able to recoup my loss (and avoid having to deal with the return) by cutting it into thirds and tying a 6 ish inch piece of elastic through the sides. I plan to stitch across the top to keep it from rolling inward. If I was really motivated, I would fold the hem inward and stitch across to make a nice neat edge (and would possibly cut it in half, not thirds, for this to allow for the seam), but I'm lazy so I won't even sew across the whole thing, just enough to keep it in place. Super lazy.... But the fabric for this purpose is great because it's actually pretty thick and good quality, and since it doesn't stretch, it makes a decent covid mask.<br /><br />So. If you're buying it to use for its intended purposes, don't bother. If you just really like the unicorn fabric, then make sure you have some elastic (hair ties won't work unless you cut the fabric loop open) or shoelaces to thread through, and a needle/thread, and you can whip up three masks of good quality fabric."
2.0,Much smaller than expected. Nice size for a baby.
2.0,"Gifted this to my kiddo on Valentine's day.  The chain and medallion were both gold-colored 2 days ago. The chain oxidized quickly is already a rose color that does not match the medallion. If the metal didn't change color, I'd have been OK with the medallion only having the image on one side and generally looking cheaply made given the price especially since my child is a big Pirates of the Caribbean fan and was happy with it. But my son is now disappointed with a rose-colored chain..."
2.0,"Look good on the picture, but in real life they are so big and hide half my face."
2.0,Why didn't I read the reviews!? This band comes undone at the slightest disruption. Not good at all for the gym.
2.0,"found the arms ""sticky"" and it was hard to open the glasses to put them on"
2.0,"I have bought several of these over the past few years.  Yesterday, the third pair broke at the same place - right were the arm meets the hinge.  This area is very thin and snaps off.  So I won't be buying them again.  Would rather pay a little more for glasses that don't break."
2.0,This dress was no where the length shown in the description. The neck piece was to weak to hold up the bodess so I had to have adjustments made. Beautiful dress but not worth having the Xtra money spent on having it rush ordered .
2.0,I brought these as a surprise for my boyfriend and they where delivered October 9th. It is October 24th and mine has completely broken and his is fraying away. I loved the bracelets but the string needs to change if they are going to be worth purchasing.
2.0,Poor quality. Fell apart after a short time. The shoulder strap broke off and the handles are starting to fray.
2.0,the material isn't that  comfortable and I feel like it is suffocating my rib cage
2.0,"It's cute but the material is cheap and overall it's not great quality. My daughter has worn it once and probably won't wear it again for a while. It looks so much cuter in the picture but it's not that bad. Wouldn't buy from this company again, the outfit might as well be made with paper and tape. Just my opinion."
2.0,"These watchbands are very well made, but unfortunately they are very different in size when I ordered multiple colors.  Some were very tight, and others were very loose.  You really don't know how it's going to fit until you get it.  I ordered two navy blue bands for my daughter and me.  One fit perfect and the other was way too big.  Too bad since we both really liked the style."
2.0,White top of dress is very thin and can be seen straight through. Would require a cami but didn’t look right with one. Very cute and fits good other wise.
2.0,Small and all one color!! No grey-pink.<br />Very disappointed.
2.0,It looks really comfortable but in real after receiving it there is no free movement for your hands as the lace fabric is not enough to raise your hands. It also is too big the pants if your a smaller body frame looks like a pillowcase over your body. It unfortunate the design doesn't flatter.
2.0,Great for kids.  Overall this is a sad hat. The wire rim came so mangled that when it was straightened out a couple wires I think broke. Not sure why The band looks the way it does. It like it’s missing something.
2.0,As is typical this is too small for my big fat head.  It says up to 60cm but I measured my head and it's 60cm (probably more like 59) so I don't think that's accurate.
2.0,The buttons are coming off the thread is coming out the coat not satisfied at all very disappointed
2.0,These are great looking socks and I would like to buy several more pairs BUT they had an awful smell that doesn't seem to wash out. They will probably end up in the trash. I did't realize when I first ordered them they were shipped from overseas Products that are shipped often have this smell . After doing the research I think these are sprayed with a chemical insecticide.
2.0,"Very thin and cheaply made. Not worth the price, better off making costume. Yellow buttons in front not actual buttons but fabric."
2.0,Loved it - too small for the measurements
2.0,These are so cute but way too short to wear anywhere. Almost like wearing a pair of boy short underwear :/
2.0,"The beaded rainbows came hot glued together and one was broken, one of the other rainbows backing was broken off. Had to super glue it together"
2.0,The material is very cheap and pills immediately.
2.0,"These are decent enough charms, but I didn't receive the full amount and 20 had nothing to do with Christmas. Money bags, cowboy boots, and witches hats don't really mean Christmas to me. Some are very abstract and strange, so will throw those away.<br />It would have been a good value if I had received the number stated. As it is, there's about 60 I can use. That is obviously half the number I was anticipating."
2.0,The quality is not ideal... The size is more for kids than for adult - it's quite small. YET loose - does not hold well.. :(
2.0,Originally I ordered a large because of the reviews but it was too big. I'm not a fan of returning items so I bought a medium. It fit well. However after 1 wear and 1 wash the seams have come apart and there is a hole around the neckline. Bummer.
2.0,The lace looked really cheap on this dress and I'm sure after a few washes it would not last.  I am 5'10' so the dress was pretty short on me too.  May fit others different.
2.0,"Ring sizing and comfortability are great- but after a couple days of wearing this- the finish comes right off. This is a picture of wearing this ring for 6 days, and the ring isn’t beautiful anymore. It’s unfortunate because I loved the design and the feel, and I thought it’d be a great substitute for my actual ring in this last month of pregnancy, but I’ve since just ordered new silicone rings from another company."
2.0,Not what I expected. Not made well. Returned
2.0,"Beautiful watch. Stopped working a week after wearing it. Replaced the batter, and it still only works occasionally."
2.0,They were huge. I ordered a small and had to give them to my friend.
2.0,The zipper broke within a week. Nice colorthough
2.0,Buy in correct size good material.
2.0,"These are tiny and cut off circulation to hands.  I have VERY SMALL hands for an adult woman (ring size 4.5) but they don't fit and are only a little stretchy.  I tried washing them a few times hoping they would stretch out, but they didn't.  They seem well made other than that, but they're useless."
2.0,"Got these replacement lenses because mine were accidentally trampled on with football cleats. Oakley apparently doesn’t make replacement lenses for these glasses. The fit was great, but only after 3 months of use the coating already has spots in my third picture. 60 day warranty..."
2.0,"The coat arrived promptly using my Amazon Prime. I am always pleased with what I order from Amazon, but this time, I have been sorely disappointed.<br />This coat came with NO belt even though it had belt loops and the photo clearly shows a belt. I checked all the pockets and the packaging inside the Amazon box  but the belt was simply not in the package.<br />Our granddaughter is an adult and wears a size 2-3 in almost everything. I ordered her a size Large so she could wear a bulky sweater under the coat during the winter. When she opened her present today and tried the coat on, she could barely get her arms in the sleeves and it was very tight across her back even with just a thin top on. One of the outer sleeves  had the seam sewn on the top instead of underneath the arm where it should have been.  The coat's lining was soft but did not fit inside the coat as well as I thought it should, even with the buttons fastened.<br />***IF you decide to order this jacket, be warned.. Order 2-3 sizes LARGER than what you think you will need!***<br />Because the coat is made in an Asian Country, the sizes run really really small!"
2.0,Fit is too small.
2.0,"I purchased this along with another identical piece from<br />Another vendor.  Both in XL.....this arrived, and while it was exactly as pictured, the size was horribly off. It was definitely Asian sizing.  Too small. The Xl fit likes medium.  Would not recommend unless you know that."
2.0,The only way to describe this fabric was loud. I was expecting a soft shirt but I couldn't get past the feel.
2.0,this was a short and wide scrub top. Love the print just wish it fit better
2.0,"The fascinator was nice - although I would have called it &#34;burgundy&#34; instead of &#34;red.&#34;  However, there was no clip on the back and no apparent way to attach one.  I ended up hot-gluing a hair clip I already had onto it.<br /><br />The attached picture is what the back looked like when it was shipped to me."
2.0,"The positives... the fringe is cute as it is like a wide stripe of lace and this top is a bright pop of color and an easy and effortless cover-up piece that fits just about any shape or size. This just has no shape to it at all. I don't know what kind of magicians they have photographing pieces like this but there really is nothing attractive about the way it drapes. The fabric is also fragile. Just walking by something in my house, the item poked and hooked through the material because it has such a loose weave. I can't imagine wearing it at a beach or poolside because the fabric doesn't seem durable."
2.0,"Unless you like writing in your picks, don't buy this version.  We had 8 write-ins.  Household names in fantasy: Josh Gordon, Reggie Bush, James White, Terrel Pryor and Christine Michael were among those picked that did not have a sticker. Also, you will need your own sharpie for write-ins.  Spend the additional $ for the CBS version.  On two other drafts, only two write-ins for flyers in the final rounds.<br /><br />The draft board was nice.  The sticker color coding was not great for the blue-green color blind.  Again, this is an area that CBS excels."
2.0,Dress ran larger than expected and material was thin and see through..
2.0,It’s really short and the sleeves are abnormally short
2.0,"The orange and red zig zag are more neon-ish/vibrant than it looks in the pic.  Not as southwestern or fall-ish as I expected.<br /><br />I am 5’5”, 160 lbs and ordered a medium.  It fits fine; not to big and not to small but think I would have liked a looser fit so may order a large."
2.0,"Was so excited for these but they give me and everyone else who tried them on, double vision under water."
2.0,Cheap fabric.  Sizes run very small.  It’s in my “donate/give away” pile.
2.0,Size large. I was very excited to wear it however it’s ripped along the zipper right on the first wear :(
2.0,Update: I wore these shoes for the SECOND time and they broke as soon as I got out of my car. I got one entire use out of them. 2/5 stars only because they're cute<br /><br />I got these to wear to a wedding over the summer. They're very lightweight but they held up the whole day full of activities! I walked away with no blisters. Adjustable straps were a nice touch since I have size 10 feet that a little on the wider side. 4/5 stars just because they feel fairly cheap and I'm not sure how many uses I will ultimately be able to squeeze out of them.
2.0,This is a very uncomfortable shirt. I lived the way it looked but was too uncomfortable.
2.0,"Very pretty and dainty, but lost one the first day wearing it,"
2.0,"It was too.short.  But, it is a nice dress."
2.0,Really cheap quality and mask had lots of loose material hanging.
2.0,I prefer a thinner chain with a less shiny appearance.  The bright gold and heavier chain makes it look cheap :(
2.0,super cheaply made
2.0,"The description indicates there is an adjustable waistband, there is not."
2.0,"Way too big, I have a small face but they wouldn't even stay up on my boyfriends face. The material is really nice though, was super disappointed."
2.0,"It's cute, but the clasp broke right out of the package. I didn't even get to wear it and already I have to fix it."
2.0,"The beads are plastic with eyes sloppily painted on them. It looks super cheap, I tossed out the beads and re-used the wire to make a nicer looking bracelet."
2.0,Ordered it specifically because it came with a headband but the package arrived and no headband came.
2.0,Returning these earrings. They arrived bent and the post looks like it’s made of an unpolished nickel or something. Backs did not fit snuggly on the back either.
2.0,The first time we washed them part of the design came off. I even washed them inside out.
2.0,"Bought these in February, used them for 6 months (injured or traveling the other 3 months) before the silver coating started wearing off in big areas on either side of the nose.  I cleaned them regularly and kept these glasses in the original Rudy Project hard case.<br /><br />Did they work well at the beginning - Absolutely. Definitely polarized!  Are they less expensive than the Rudy Project replacement lenses - Absolutely.  Are they worth replacing twice a year - NO.<br /><br />What's the point of the lens - protect the eye.  Did these - Nope."
2.0,Wry uncomfortable by the toe thing. Smaller than others. But height and padding is perfect. Too bad. I would love it if it had a thong like the Oofos. They would outsell them.
2.0,I had purchased this for my husband last June and it stopped working this Feb.  I think you get what you pay for.  Would not recommend this.
2.0,I just didn’t like the way it looked; it looked cheap and poorly done.
2.0,It seems to me that anytime they have a doctored or cartoonish illustration of the product instead of a real picture that you're pretty much going to be disappointed when you get it. That's basically what happened with this purchase because as soon as I looked at them I was disappointed. They have a  dull finish and we're almost kind of ugly. They look better in the picture.
2.0,Colors are much more muted and dull on sleeve.
2.0,"The lenses are really bad quality very disappointed, the only good is the color everything else 👎🏻"
2.0,It started to fall apart before I put it on.
2.0,Order a girls 14/16 it would have fit a woman who wears a medium returned the product. The material was nice didn't feel cheap or thin
2.0,Drawstrings are too long. Looks odd. Had to constantly re-arrange the gathers.
2.0,"Fine visually, but too prickly if you are intending to touch them. Would easily scratch a child's cheek, for example."
2.0,"After 4 times using it to go outside on my bike, nose pads fell down and the black painting started to crack down"
2.0,Too large. And very long. I am 5’9”. I wanted something to cover my but but this thing hangs in the front half way to my knees. I’m returning. Good fabric and sold Constuction.
2.0,"Returned this dress. The sleeves were tight and had no give whatsoever. It was ok, but not very flattering."
2.0,"I purchased this necklace for the length-to hang below chest level.  This is a nice necklace and I am keeping it, however it is equivalent to 18-20"".  It falls inside the collar of v-neck shirts.  Not what I was hoping for."
2.0,"Cute style and fit well but disliked the material. Reminded me of cheap, thin, Halloween costume material. Retuned for refund."
2.0,They look more like paper towels then toilet paper.
2.0,The outfit was ok but I wouldn't buy it again. Fabric was cheap
2.0,Such a pretty dress and then they put a seam right down the middle of the dress! From the neck to the feet. What the heck?! The back of the dress should have been the front of the dress and then it would have been perfect! Or they should have put the seam somewhere else!! Because it is a very beautiful dress otherwise but then all you see is that seam.
2.0,"Shoes look great but really fit horribly, I am displeased with my buy, I'd recommend another brand."
2.0,"It didn't look at all like in the picture, the material was heavy and thick, and the small I ordered fit like a large."
2.0,"Fit is fine, maybe a bit large. It slid right on. Nice light fabric for summer, I guess. There is really no support at all, though. Calling this &#34;firm control&#34; is very misleading. I don't expect something to make me thin, I just want a few bulges smoothed & this doesn't do that in any way. Really disappointed in it, actually, I'll never wear this & it was expensive."
2.0,I ordered size 6/7T what I got I think my 9 month old could wear pretty soon
2.0,wore it once and it broke...poor quality
2.0,"Not what's pictured. Bones are not screen printed on.  The bones are just in the fingers, not  all the way down on the hands as this pix shows. Cheap"
2.0,Runs really small. Order 3 times bigger
2.0,I ordered my usual size L and it was extremely small! The model on the pictures is probably wearing 2 or even 3 sizes bigger than her usual size. I’m definitely returning this!
2.0,"I know the stone is supposed to be small and I expected it to be. However, you can not tell this is Garnet, it looks black. I had to tell my daughter it was her birthstone. It was very disappointing."
2.0,"cord is uncomfortable and the ring feels really cheap, and color wears off quickly."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Don't give it a good long life expectation.
2.0,They tangle together so easily! I’m spending most of my time keeping them straight.
2.0,I followed instructions as directed on the bottle. It worked ok for some hats and not at all for others. I was worried it would stain my hats and it didn’t stain but it did leave like a white almost powdery residue on one of my hats.
2.0,"It looks OK, although the color was very different from what I had expected. It is more orange than brown. But I could live with that. Unfortunately, the quality turned out to be very bad. I have been using it for a month only, but the material it was made of is falling apart and you can see its white inside content on different parts of the bag. I understand that it was not an expensive bag but I still was hoping to use it for more than a month. So I am very disappointed :("
2.0,"The Frames Quality has to be Improved, by adding more material (plastic) to the frames and maybe making it a little bit thicker these way when I get my reading crystals installed IT DOSEN'T BRAKE"
2.0,"If you follow the measurements to pick a size, it should fit just fine. I ordered a Medium as I am not super busty (32C) but my waist is 29&#34; and it fit nicely, a little lose but I'd rather that than it squeezing me to death. Not too big on the top, fit good around the waist, and flared out well on the bottom. The dress goes a few inches above my knees (I am 5'4&#34;) BUT the slip under did cover all of my cooch and covered about half of my bottom and since the top layer is see through you can tell where the slip is and it doesn't look good. The zipper is pretty cheap, as I said it was a little lose fitting and it was still getting stuck and I was afraid I was going to break it. The fabric is soft, not itchy. All in all  not terrible, but I just can't do this dress with those faults and will be returning.  [[ASIN:B01N4NSWC5 Dreaweet Women's Mesh Vintage Floral Lace Swing Halter Neck Sleeveless Skater Dress]]"
2.0,Everything falls apart
2.0,no where  close to the fit and comfort of the poem nose piece
2.0,Nice color but it wasn’t flattering for my figure
2.0,Took forever to receive & it's just ok...material is thin & cheap
2.0,"Plus side: came on time, thats it for the pulse side.  Hard to attach chains to, some of the hardware did not lock, poor quality"
2.0,Frayed quickly.
2.0,"Product runs very small, material is thin, but it felt great! I will be giving it away."
2.0,I was disappointed. The material was so thin it was see through on my chest. I had a beige bra and you could see straight through. Waist hit at the empire dress style not like in the picture.<br />I’m 5’5” 175 lbs and got a large. Just not a great dress for me.
2.0,"Also, the mini screwdriver does not fit the flat head screws."
2.0,"It was good up until week 2, it never wanted to stay on and eventually fell apart, good for its price though."
2.0,Purchased a small but it fits like a large. A little disappointing because it’s a nice shirt
2.0,"Now I know my head is on the smaller side, but this is ridiculous. This will only fit someone with a large to extra large sized head. If that's you, this might be exactly what you're looking for, but this gets a big star deduction for not advertising it as an extra large. This is in no way a one size fits most face cover. In these pictures, I'm not even stretching this, just holding it out so you can see the size. There's a good 4"" of room here to go before this would stay on my face on its own. The mask itself is pretty thin. The pattern is cute, but that's all it had going for it. I don't recommend this at all."
2.0,Product is not true to size. The item was cute that was Cut for a much smaller size than what it was advertised as.
2.0,"This Jean's were too tight, they fit my husband like leggings."
2.0,My son is 5’8” 120lbs and it was tight on him
2.0,I ordered a crew neck cardigan and this is not. Also the description says JJ Perfection and the tag states another company. The color is much darker than the photo shows. Overall very disappointed in this. Will not order from seller again.
2.0,You can barely see through them. It would be dangerous to drive with these on.
2.0,"This outfit is nothing like I thought it would be. The material is cheap, This jumpsuit is clingy, not in a good way, just does not fit right. The color is not like an army green, lighter green, dull. I would not buy this again."
2.0,Broke the first day I had it
2.0,Ripped easily along the seas
2.0,"These are cute, but pretty much not wearable without somethin underneath them."
2.0,"Bad quality  - pitted stainless steel, bad time keeping"
2.0,"This fit my little guy (18mo) so well! Even though it didn’t stay clean too long it served exactly what we needed. That night I treated the the few food stains with oxi clean, proceeded to put in wash. After drying I found several holes and tears all over! And this was one wash cycle…so highly disappointed that it won’t be wearable again."
2.0,"If you've seen the first episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, then you know. The jacket zipper has a mind of its own, and that mind thinks dirty. At least it gave me a laugh.<br /><br />As for the pants, the ankles were jogger style, but huge. Very bizarre. Returning these guys."
2.0,Got these “light”compression socks for my elderly father and he couldn’t even pull them on. Very disappointed
2.0,"Sleeves are good but the length of the shirt is short. Also, after only 1 wash, the black heart faded."
2.0,"Before buying the maroon looking hoodie, note that it will arrive bright red, not maroon"
2.0,"For reference, I'm 5'6"" and 180lbs, usually a size L. I ordered the XL because other comments said to size up. It made me look like a bag of potatoes, but is very very comfortable. Returned it."
2.0,"Size is not as it actually is,"
2.0,The fabric is very low quality
2.0,"Thought I was ordering turquoise, but the item turned out to be pink,  Also ordered what they said was a 6/8.  The size is more like a 4/6, too small."
2.0,"Well, I ordered the Beanie Tail but received something entirely different.  It was a gift and the recipient seemed to like it."
2.0,Only one piece will lock into the display piece. The other week not even sit in the slot. Does not fit.
2.0,I am not a fan of the material or fit of this dress.  Not for my body type.
2.0,It is so tiny and thin. I don't think it is worth 59.00. I did not send it back
2.0,My toddler had these in his hands for no longer than 20 seconds before the arm snapped off. Not durable AT ALL!
2.0,"I was really looking forward to these leggings, but unfortunately one of the mesh pockets had a tear. The material of the mesh seems low quality or poorly made and I realized if it wasn't ripped now, it probably would have ripped in the near future (and with important items in the pocket.) Returned immediately.<br /><br />To help others for sizing purposes: I got a size M, I'm 5'8"" and around 135-140 lbs with an athletic build. The waist band was a bit loose on me but it was a comfortable fit and long enough, so I would kept it if it didn't have a tear!"
2.0,The stitching easily came out.
2.0,"Beautiful skirt. Looks like the picture. The issue was the sizing. I ordered a medium. For reference, I am 5'7&#34; and weigh 145 lbs. The skirt fit sitting low on my hips but was extremely large to fit high waisted. I was bummed out bc it's a cute outfit. I debated on ordering the small but the length was almost too short with the medium so I didn't want to try the small. I will be returning it."
2.0,Only wore twice and it was actually during boxing sparring.  The soles starting coming lose from the heel end.  Had to return as that defect creates a safety issue.  I’ve bought Adidas before and never had a quality issue but this pair was junk.
2.0,"Cute, but difficult to get around key."
2.0,These are very cheaply made.  Scratches all over the stones and they are very cheap looking. Stones pop out easily.
2.0,Got loose within a few weeks
2.0,"My 4 year old (slim) child finds it hard to get in . you will have to help your child to put it on , making an effort to put it in position and during washroom break your child will need your help again . Though it is stretchable but not comfortable enough stretch for kids . Moreover it looks more like an legging to be worn under a skirt . So ""No"" from me . I could not return it as I was in a hurry ."
2.0,"This is a cute dress but the color is dull, not exactly like the picture."
2.0,"First impression is it’s tiny, bracelet feels like like a can of soda. The Gold color with the black is what I like, but for $75 I can get better quality on materials coming from AliExpress."
2.0,Beautiful blouse but runs about 3 sizes large.
2.0,"It is a nice print however its cheaply made, it ripped before I was on my way out to dinner, save your money on this one, its cheaply made"
2.0,Cheap looking.  Material is scratchy and low quality. Chinese sellers with Chinese products sell things that don't even look close to the pictures in the post.
2.0,The sweatshirt is great HOWEVER the arms are short! I have short arms so it isn't too bad but they are short and it looks better if u just push up the sleeves so u don't have to look at them being short. Too bad bc I was excited about this. I'll wear it when its warm enough to push the sleeves up. Wouldnt recommended buying.
2.0,It’s stylish but not comfy
2.0,Had a tear and was damp inside package. Had a bad odor.
2.0,Color way off from what was pictured... The sleeves were short. Returned with no issues and quick refund!
2.0,Didn't keep time!
2.0,"I had to return the flannel pants, they were too small.<br />also, the waist isn't elastic, so no stretching."
2.0,The fit isn't anything like the photo.  If you have big breasts this is definitely not for you.
2.0,Wonderful gift. Beautiful. The only issue we have is the charm keeps falling off of the kechain. Contacting support for assistance.
2.0,Runs big and not flattering
2.0,Thin material and probably an actual medium in Women's sizes will never fit me
2.0,To small . Period
2.0,The diamonds fell out after just 2 wears!
2.0,It's a beautiful band but since I've been wearing it I had to remove at least three links so it don't twist on my wrist but now it's starting to twist again but I refuse to remove another link because than I wouldn't be able to put it on smh
2.0,The 7/8 is more like a 5/6. I don't recommend the light pink since they get dirty very fast. The shoes are soft and sturdy but too narrow.
2.0,"Update:<br />I decided to keep this because I was able to make it work under my cycling helmet, but as it turns out, I really don't like it. The material is noisy, as someone else wrote, but also, I find it very hard to hear through. This is troublesome because I have a riding partner and we talk. When I talk my voice sounds muffled in my own head. It's a bit like being underwater and it's annoying. It is warm, but I'm going to continue shopping for something better.<br />__________<br /><br />This seems like it's nicely made, but if you have a small head this is enormous. The cap and the bag are both marked Medium, but nowhere in the description does it indicate it's a medium. I never would have bought it if it did. So... if you have a small head, go elsewhere. Otherwise, give it a try. It seems pretty nice."
2.0,"This dress is beautiful... Except for the fact that it was packaged in plastic wrap, folded up to the point where it created 15 wrinkles. The dress has to be steam cleaned or taken to the dry cleaners to even wear.  This is the type of dress that needs to be sent on A HANGAR.  It's a beautiful dress without all the wrinkles."
2.0,The print is nice but the fabric feels cheap. It looks like a night gown than a maternity dress.
2.0,Small in the thigh area.
2.0,Clasp brakes off within 60 days of having it
2.0,Shirt fits well but the leopard print is VERY orange!! Too much for me but still it is a cute top!
2.0,They’re so pretty and hurt so bad! The posts are huge with a little “v” on them to close into the clasp but they tear my ears every time I wear them. Was hoping they’d be an every day staple and instead they make my ears bleed.
2.0,These were a little too lightweight for me.
2.0,"#. 1. this product is advertised as 100% cotton-- the reason I bought it, but it was only 40% cotton...<br />It also said to choose one size higher to fit properly, which I didn't, I went with the usual size small but even that was too big.<br />Also advertising at it's best. One set arrived in 2 days, the other is still 3 weeks away being shipped from China.  It is sad that we cannot tell off the bat, where the product is made and that would very much help in decision making."
2.0,"These are decent gloves, albeit overpriced.  The XL size does not fit my XL hands and I tear more of them than finally make it on.  They are tough and would suit someone with smaller hands but I bought XL for a reason."
2.0,Not what I thought it would be. Looks strong and sturdy in the photo but it is actually very flimsy and I'm afraid it's going to end up snagging on something the first time I wear it. Not worth $28 (with shipping). There are better scarves at Target and Kohls for $16.99.
2.0,Great quality especially for the price point
2.0,"Im glad it came in on time and I was very excited to see the mask. But after I worr em, I was very dissapointed on how small the panda mask came, when I wore it, you have to adjust the front part so that it fits in your face, but when you do that, your hair will be exposed on the back. The image shows that its big that even the back of the adult head will fit. Not the mask I have. False Image. The description never said anything about the size, whether it will fit perfectly on the kid size or not on adult.. overall, the Latex Image is good, but has false image and lack of description.. I dont recommend getting this from them. Find somwhere else better. Unless they fix this mistake."
2.0,"They fit great on my face and reflect the sun good, but they get dirty really easily and the lenses are hard to clean."
2.0,the bars bend on the first time I wore them
2.0,"Other reviews are true... they wouldn’t function as safe masks... but I’m not returning because the only return option is USPS pick up, which costs $5-6."
2.0,"Should have read the reviews before purchasing. I was in a hurry because I needed it for grandson bd at the end of the week. My grandson is into pretend hunting ghost so this looked cute. For the money it should have actually had a trap door that opened to at least make it somewhat realistic. None of the knobs turn, it's just a solid piece of plastic. Very disappointing to him and myself. Would be good for a accessory to an adult costume."
2.0,"The mask fits ok but, why the white frame around the face mask???"
2.0,"The string on the shirts is of ribbon material ...for the cost, should be better made.  Smells like burning rubber so make sure to wash it first.....and hope the ribbon shit doesn't come out during....purchase is a regret for sure......"
2.0,Still tight I got bigger size
2.0,Doesn't provide the level of support that i expected - 40DD
2.0,"There are sharp burrs inside the ring that scratch up my finger. The ring looks great but feels extremely cheap and isn't well made. The main &#34;stone&#34; jiggles around from side to side (very slightly) and the mounts, having too much space in between, catch on every little thing of clothing/hair/etc. It is pretty and a good fake ring for work but I have to take it off before I do anything."
2.0,"I normally don’t write reviews but i brought this for my daughter & her birthday party i was extremely excited when i ordered it but disappointed once i opened the package. Don’t get me wrong it is a nice design & color but the bottoms where extremely to big it did have elastic for the waist but the bottoms for the legs had no liner , it’s very baggy for a bathing bottom & also the top has a latch I’m not sure why someone would make a bathing like that when children would be playing in it . I do like that the straps are adjustable but i do not like the straps because they can unlatch when playing. It’s cute but definitely WILL NEED ALTERATIONS!"
2.0,"This dress was way too small! I measured and bought this dress and I also bought one from another company with the same measurements. This dress showed up and probably would have fit just fine had there been elastic at the waistline. How are you supposed to get a dress on if you can’t fit your shoulders or hips through the waist hole and there’s no zipper or anything? Lol my struggle to wiggle through that opening was probably hilarious but never managed to make it over my shoulders or hips. I measured and it was correct, but without an elastic waist or zipper closure of some kind ya can’t get the thing on."
2.0,It seems to be made well enough but it resembles more of a woman's purse  not at all what I had pictured in my mind not very satisfied will probably send it back
2.0,Print is not as pictures and the material is cheap looking.
2.0,"I normally wear a medium but ordered a size up just in case, ended up being too big in the arms and okay-ish in the torso.<br /><br />the main part of the shirt was okay, light fabric good for summer, but  fake buttons that weren't sewn straight and the sleeves look very odd on, like straight tubes, not widening as it goes down the arm like shown in the picture.<br /><br />Not as cute in person"
2.0,This fit like a dress.  It almost reached my knees.
2.0,Picture shows slippers with high back. What I received is slippers with no back and they keep falling off child's feet.
2.0,"The lining of the bra is made of rubber.  I was so confused!  The lining of the bra, the portion of the bra that goes against my skin.  It was like having tire treads holding up my breast.  Needless to say, I never used the bra. I am giving it 2 stars because if lining was different it would be a nice bra."
2.0,It is pretty but it is only just below my waist. Was expecting it to the middle of my hips.  I  think I will sew on another layer to make it work.
2.0,We could not use this item. Had to order from a different brand.
2.0,I really liked this until the top of the band slipped out of where it connects and is now essentially worthless. Wasn't doing anything strenuous or crazy for it to break. Should last more than 3 months. Not worth it.
2.0,"From the front these do look kinda cute-kitzy, but they are about 1/2"" thick, so they look weird if you ever turn your head sideways.  As I do not plan on speaking to people with my head only facing directly at them, not by best side, I am sending them back.  If you have a bad profile and avoid turning your head away from people, you might like them."
2.0,"I was disappointed by this skirt. Nice texture and print of fabric. But very casual, as it has no finished seam at hem, just raw edge.  Waist has way too much fabric, so it makes one ""look fat"", whereas you'd think that one goal of incorporating a long vertical pleated design is to have a slimming effect on one's figure. Good length. I would have liked to have worn this skirt to work, but will have to pass on this one. Too many compromises in its construction."
2.0,I bought this for my long locs and it ripped at two wears.....
2.0,"I love the look of the shirt. However, there are 2 things I don't like. First, the quality. I've worn it about 4 times and have had to repair stitching on it after the second wear and I have more stitching to fix. It just comes completely out in both the sleeves and around the waist. Second, the knot isn't a not at all. It is strange looking and I have to keep messing with it to make it look good. Wasn't expecting a waffle type material but it's ok."
2.0,quality was not as good as I had expected
2.0,It was clingy and staticky.
2.0,Super cute when you first get them but they wear very easily and quickly! We got them on 2/4/2020 and by 2/28 they had begun to noticeably wear. Photo is from 3/9/2020. She does wear these at least 3x a week to daycare(2.5yr old)
2.0,"Inconsistent  product information there was no  20 inch chain included with the charm , product was placed in a ring box. I can't rate this seller any higher until the correct product information is placed online or the chain is provided. perhaps my review would change."
2.0,these slippers don't have enough rubber on the bottom to prevent slipping.  Our 2 yr old slipped backwards on our tile floor 3 times in 30 minutes.  We don't have any carpet in our home so we will add rubber to the bottoms.
2.0,It looks prettier in the picture.  It was smaller than expected.  I returned it.
2.0,"Cape colors don't match dress.  Cape does not cover arms.  Falls to the front or the back.  Nice concept if it did like the picture, but it doesn't."
2.0,This dress has rhinestones on it which show in the colored photos but not on the black dress. Which is what I ordered and I now have to pay for a $20 shipping to return it after I already paid $20 to receive it. Right flap of dress does not stay up and and dress is sooo short. I can’t wear heals with it. The hem of the dress is also uneven.
2.0,Much bigger and heavier than I anticipated so I won’t be able to wear them. They’re very gaudy so limited as where I would have worn them but they’re too heavy for me to want to wear at all. I like them but they don’t work for me.
2.0,At first look the band looks nice but does not include instructions. Im a hands on type of guy and was able to figure out how to adjust the band properly but it definitely took me a minute. I wish they would have specified that it only fits the 46 mm not the 42mm. This bums me out because i got this as a gift for xmas.
2.0,The band broke loose from the watch. It lasted six months and then the adhesive failed and the band split.
2.0,"It started turning colors the 2nd day I wore it.  Now I am wearing the silvertone one today and I will see if this one does the same.  Otherwise I like it but I can't wear it if its turning colors, the chain and clasp are turning."
2.0,Feel apart the moment my GF wore it.
2.0,"I got what I paid for. it is what it is. it's a good color, but not great quality."
2.0,I liked it and it looked nice but in ten days the band broke...
2.0,The orange color is nothing like in the pic. It’s more of a burnt orange - almost brown. Yuk. I wanted the orange that is depicted in the picture.  :(
2.0,Glasses look cheap one pair cane scratched
2.0,It was OK but did not live up to my expectations!
2.0,"The quality wasn't what I expected, I really don't recommend it."
2.0,I carry this item in my purse all the time and used it twice. It works great. But the plastic on the back (acts as a grip so the hanger doesn't move if your purse is swinging) fell off. I bought crazy glue and put it back on. Let's hope it will hold so I don't have to find another purse hanger.
2.0,"In my opinion it looked cheap,  I could actually see the glue they used on the necklace"
2.0,You get what you pay for. Cheep.
2.0,I ordered this dress for my prom and i have big thighs and saw it fit smaller than normal so i ordered one size up than i usually do but when i got it it fit perfect every where except my thighs. i contacted top dress and they apologized and said they would “hand make one to size” and to send my measurements. i knew they weren’t going to hand make it but they gave me one for free and told me to keep the other one. i received my dress fairly quickly (a few weeks). it fit fairly well but i got it altered. my biggest problem is the dresses material doesn’t give at all and after alterations i can’t sit but i love the dress so o don’t care.
2.0,I LOVED THE SKIRT COLOR AND PATTERN. This skirt ran small and had a zipper instead elastic.
2.0,"No hole for the flash, poor match for the phone..."
2.0,I ordered a size up but still came too small.
2.0,Dislike! Would have sent back if it wasn’t a bigger hassle than just keeping it. The color is faded and does not look black and white.
2.0,"I wasn’t too impressed with these. They are cheap and the materials aren’t high quality but if you need them as a temporary solution until you find something better, they are fine. I did find them a little bit uncomfortable at first but quickly got used to them. They do what they intend to do which is to prevent your glasses from sliding down during normal use. I would not use these for playing sports or any heavy activity though. I also found it a little difficult to slip the rubber onto the ends of my glasses and had to use some force to get them on, so much so that I was concerned I might cause breakage."
2.0,"Made me too hot, I almost fainted"
2.0,Two sizes smaller.
2.0,Fit ok colors are way way off robe is neon green and yellow looks kind of awful for the price disappointed
2.0,"Color is 100x brighter than it looks, in person."
2.0,"Although these vests are very soft and cute, they run small. I bought my 6 year old the largest size, and it looks very small on him. I will keep it though because it fits his 2 yr old brother."
2.0,"Besides running small, even when a larger size is ordered, the design is very restrictive/confining in the front where support needs to be provided but in a comfortable way.  The material was quality and the supplier was good."
2.0,"As you can see the knot part of the tie was VERY loosely held together. i put it on my son and very lightly (like, barely tugged bc i already knew it was not well made) pulled the knot of the neck tie to tighten it’s extremely loose and unfolded part and the whole thing came apart!? very poorly made and sewn together. the suspenders seem more well made and durable however."
2.0,"Bought this as a gift to myself. It is cut too large, but a smaller size would be too tight.<br />The ""fur"" also sheds and I have not worn it more than once.<br />The zippers in the pockets are also very rough, first night I wore it my knuckles were scratched up from pulling my items out of the pocket a few times."
2.0,Complicated to use and it easily can get tangled lol. It's cute though if you can take the time to figure out. Definitely thin chains and be wary of accidentally breaking them.
2.0,"The dangles are poorly made and are very stiff.  while trying to adjust, one of the stones fell out.  Super glued it back in and still wore them.  They look nice though.  (I had a matching necklace)"
2.0,Hat is huge.  Fan works but way to noisy.
2.0,I purchased a size 2T/3T for my 4 year old and it is too big for my 7 year old. It would probably fit a 10 year old. The fit is waaaaay off.
2.0,"I ordered my correct size 6mm or 2 gauge. And they are freaking awesome, but they wouldn’t stay in my ears. Because instead of being actually double flared they were more of a straight edge, if that makes any sense. They are nice and bright beautiful color of blue cracked glass too, I wish they would make them in a 1 gauge or 7 mm because I know those would stay in my lobes. Because next I tried a 0 gauge or 8 mm just to give it a try, and those were way too large. I guess I could have used the tape trick to keep them in place, but I wasn’t trying to do all that. The 2 gauge just seemed so small compared to my other 2 gauge jewelry as well. My order arrived on time as expected in nice package too. So this was a bummer because I really wanted these to work, so just know they won’t be tight and the lip edge of the flare isn’t much flare at all. The picture of them looks like the flare is correct but they just aren’t that way when you get them. Hope I helped out!"
2.0,"These arrived quickly! I removed them from the packaging and was thrilled with their appearance--obviously costume jewelry but not chintzy or cheap-looking. I tried them on, positive I had found the right earrings to go with my outfit for a big fancy party I have to attend, and as I removed the earrings, one of the posts broke off in my hand as I tried to replace the back. I haven't decided if I am going to go for a replacement or a refund, but BE WARNED that these were super, super flimsy."
2.0,"Size was accurate. Material is lower quality and very thin, needs slip or liner underneath."
2.0,"The product looks good and is as described however there is one major thing you need to know. The dye bleeds like crazy. My son wore his tie and spilled water on his chin that ran down to the bow tie. His mandatory white shirt of his uniform is now red from the collar down to its 3rd button. After multiple attempts to soak, clean, rinse with various products, the shirt stain is now an ugly pink. I don’t know what would happen if you wash the tie first...but the $12 dollar bow tie ruined a $40 dress shirt."
2.0,More of a shade of yellow likes others have stated. Not the best fabric and very wrinkle prone.
2.0,I'm not happy with the fact that it rolls up.  When I sit down it constantly rolls up and will not stay put.  It's unfortunate because I like it when I first put it on.
2.0,"I look for surgical stainless, wood, or natural stone when I'm purchasing gauges. These state they are stainless but I seriously doubt it. Even after washing them a few times they seriously irritated my lobes. The ouija set don't screw on, they have o-rings. I don't think it came with the correct size o ring because I lost 1 earring within a few hours, and the other one fell off a couple days later. Maybe opt for a different set with all positive reviews unless you have extra o-rings, and don't have sensitive skin. They were cute though, just bummed they didn't work out."
2.0,honestly I did not like it. Was not convince for the price I bought it for.
2.0,"The uppers are really made for people with big calves, so they don't stay up very well. There is no cushion in the bottom and no arch support. I have to wear thick socks. The price was very good."
2.0,"The purpose of cargo pants is to provide two large &#34;side&#34; pockets so you don't have to sit on what you carry. The right side cargo pocket is useless, as they have sewn a pocket inside it, which makes it impossible to get anything of size, like a wallet into it. When you order cheap pants, that is what you are going to get."
2.0,"There was nothing wrong with this item.  It was to be a gift, but when I saw the size I realized that it was too big for a petite gal. It arrived promptly and was refunded without a hitch."
2.0,"The material is more like a spandex type of material.They run small so if you order, order up a size."
2.0,"when I ordered the dress  it looked to me as the sleeves are about 10&#34; long, in reality they are about 3&#34;-4&#34;, maybe,maximum are 5&#34; long, so they are not at least to the halfway of the elbow as I assumed it would be but  barely will cover the shoulders. Also, a skirt  is more narrow than the free &#34;flowing&#34; as it was shown on a picture; and it feels as the elastic at the waist line is pulling it back, so the belly will be exposed. maybe, it is because the dressed was so wrinkled when it arrived. So, I decided to not send it as a present to my daughter - she has children and not have a time to iron dresses. its unfortunate, I wasn't impressed by it real looks.  I am going to return it. Sorry about my brutal honesty - you had asked, I have answered."
2.0,"the metal straight sock is ok but not long enough for adult sock or even for kids long socks and the socks they sent were not all consistent with its match, very cheap quality"
2.0,Didn't work for us.  Bought it for my little girls and they hurt their ears after being on for 30 minutes or so.  The magnets also move a bit when in the ear and the earrings are really small and easy to lose.  May be better for older girls.
2.0,Fits very very small. Too sad.
2.0,"Too big for a tragus earring. Plus, it doesn't seems to lock, it had fallen 3 times since I put it on yesterday. It's very cute tho, I wish it worked. :( UPDATE: My earring fell during the day and I lost it. It doesn't lock, very disappointing."
2.0,"The shirt is cute, but it's way shorter than the display picture. I'm not super well-endowed in the chest area, B-C cup, and it barely covers the girls."
2.0,I hated this dress! Unless you are super skinny it looks awful! The material felt awful too.
2.0,One shoelace did not light up after a full night charge.  Looked closer and the led wires  were sticking out. Not very durable.  Very disappointing.  My 4 year old was really looking forward to these
2.0,"I wanted to love this because 101 dalmations is my favorite but I ended up returning it. The material was cheap polyester. You could tell it would shrink and start pulling after a couple uses. Also I think it was a little small in the torso length. I bought a size Medium which fit fine, maybe more of a small size... but I deffinetkt would've wanted to be longer. The medium was more of a square box shape than a rectangle like it should be."
2.0,"Strap material is like a seat belt and a completely different shade of brown. Where you would clip your pens, there is a vinyl-like material over the edges of the inside pockets, preventing you from fluidly pulling out and clipping your pen in;actually It's nearly impossible. If you force the pen over it, it would eventually tear the vinyl edge off. And the pockets won't fit any modern phone. As soon as I opened it, I started the return process."
2.0,Poor material and fit. Too short to wear as a dress on me. I got a M and I’m 5’8. Looks like a dressing robe. Returns are all the way to China so I’ll just keep it and use as a kimono is or swim cover.
2.0,Very small XL fits like a medium
2.0,"Though billed as child-size, this is basically the same size as my husband's folding umbrella. Small adult-size is not child-size. I wouldn't recommend it for any child under 8 or 9 because the height will make it unwieldy for anyone who can't handle an adult umbrella.<br /><br />It is very light thanks to the fact that it's 80% plastic. I fully expect it to break in no time flat."
2.0,Material is cheap and shiny.  I don't like it.
2.0,"It's as expected, but there's no instructions on how to change the time or date or stop alarms. It beeps randomly throughout the day and night. No idea if it's waterproof, as I can't use it enough to water it."
2.0,"Look great, super comfortable! After wearing a couple days a week for a few weeks, not long at all, the seam on the side of one slipper busted. The sole is pulling away from the fabric."
2.0,Nice earrings but as other reviewers said (I should have listened) these are not green - more of a grey color.
2.0,Zipper broke on second time on
2.0,Shirts were not a great fabric. Also they were somewhat see through.
2.0,Is not working for me
2.0,"If you're looking for a bag that smells bad and breaks within hours of its first use, then THIS is the bag for you!<br /><br />Yes, it's cute. I used it for my big night on the town and it was the perfect addition to my dress. Unfortunately, by the end of the night, I tossed it out. Not only did it cause everything that I put in it to smell like weird chemicals (my wallet will never be the same), but the chain broke mid-strut while I was crossing an intersection. I had to risk my neck to pick up this piece of crap from incoming traffic!<br /><br />I know the reason that you're looking at this bag is because you're looking for a cute, cheap purse to pair with a cute outfit for a special occasion. For your own good, pass this by. It's not worth it."
2.0,These broke as I was trying to adjust them on my face. Don't buy. Cheap plastic.
2.0,These run very small. I ordered my daughter’s shoe size and they were nowhere near the size she needs. Order big if you want these.
2.0,"Not the same as pictured. The cut is not flattering, the materials is not of good quality."
2.0,"These laces are very thin for boots.  It's hard to tie the boots tightly when the laces are thin like these.  And I'm pretty sure I'll break one sooner than I would if it were thicker.<br /><br />The packaging was also strange.  Instead of using the package shown in the product picture, these were delivered in a little zip-lock baggie.  It looks like I bought them from a dealer on the corner.  Not impressive.<br /><br />The price is good and the convenience is OK, but the quality really isn't what I was expecting.  By the way, shipping shouldn't be an issue in a product review, but this product wasn't actually available as stated.  So instead of being delivered the next day on a Tuesday (to replace my broken boot lace), it was delivered on Friday.  All in all, this whole experience was unimpressive."
2.0,"These are fantastic absolutely loved them. Girls love their pockets. They fit wonderfully felt amazing thin material (not see through) but still kept warm in colder weather.<br /><br />Bad part: rip easily, worthless stitching job. After washing them the first time the stitching on the pockets started coming out. I was starting to find holes in my pockets and one day my phone fell out of the back pocket and broke. Went to find out the whole damn bottom of the pocket completely detached and was a fake pocket flab hanging there.  Definitely recommend restitching them if you purchase!"
2.0,"They are too thick where you connect them to the watch.  The pins break easily.  They come with only two replacement pins.  I liked these at first, until I started changing out the bands and found they were too thick, which cause the pins to break."
2.0,"I wanted to like these. Perfect size, reasonably priced, sterling silver, great fit for my cartilage piercing, but mine ended up turning black after 3 weeks. Will have to replace with something that is better quality."
2.0,They were like pajama pants.
2.0,"This watch is not worth the price.  It is clunky: very thick.  Since purchasing, I've seen several other, more attractive watches for less money.  I cannot get it to set the date.  If you don't wear it every day, it runs out and you need to rewind and reset the time.  If you do wear it every day you will notice after several days that it is a couple of minutes off in time.<br /><br />It's worth about 1/3 to 1/4 the price."
2.0,"the shirt is really great, what I expected all expect for the sizing..that's the reason for my only 3 ⭐ review. it runs very small. I'm 5'3"" and 105lbs and ordered a mens adult small and it fit extremely tight..much tighter than I prefer my t-shirts to fit. other than that tho the shirt is fine. it's texture is not soft, feels like a normal t-shirt to me and I would also recommend to other potential buyers to remind u all again, this shirt does NOT have the dot design on the back of the shirt like a lot of other SANTA CRUZ  tshrits do..only the small one on the front."
2.0,I like the buttlifter part but it's not waist trainer it bunches up needs to be adjusted the entire time wearing it
2.0,"Stiff and synthetic smelling, does not handle or look like real silk."
2.0,"This is oversized, which isn’t a huge deal because the waist can be cinched up. But the problem is the durability of the quality of the fabric. I wore it one day, and within that day it already had piling from being rubbed with a seatbelt, piling under the arms, and randomly throughout the dress. It’s also EXTREMELY easily snagged. I didn’t do anything crazy in it, just church and a restaurant and somehow that wrecked the fabric."
2.0,This Zalaver band is the second nylon band I’ve ordered for my Apple Watch.  This one isn’t as comfortable as the first band I ordered from AMANECER.  This Zalaver band is a much heavier/thicker weave which makes for a much larger “bump” at the adjutant buckle.
2.0,No huele a rosas como dice y se trozo muy fácil
2.0,Bought this as a competition holster belt.  This is not a stiff belt at all and it is so stretchy that I cannot keep my holster where it needs to stay.  The buckle lasted about 6 connections but due to the amount of stretch in the belt I could never keep it tight enough to be useful.  Ended up in 3 gun match with my belt around my knees and headed down from there.  Useless as a gun belt
2.0,"I understand that baby socks need to be snug enough not to come off, but these seem like they would cut off circulation.  Really cute, though."
2.0,The purple collar is way darker than the photo. More like plum than lilac. One of the rivets came undone & the snap broke the first time I wore it. The pink & black seem to have been put together better. I was really disappointed because I bought this set specifically for the purple one & that's the one that fell apart.
2.0,I got an L and I wished I would’ve sized down the chest area was sooo big. I had to return
2.0,very stylish shirt....it just runs very small
2.0,"I didn't receive every item showed in the photo, but 4 of one shape and 3 each of 2 different shapes"
2.0,"These leggings run small and don't seem to have good tummy control.  They have a nice, soft fabric that feels great on the skin, but they are too small for me because of the sizing being off.  I gave them to my teenage daughter and she didn't like the fit, either. They fit her size-wise but sagged in the butt, which is odd for leggings.  I gave them only 2 stars because of our fit issues. Maybe they would fit someone else differently?"
2.0,"Like others have said, false advertising! On the model in the picture, this shirt appears to be long, flowy, and of a different material. What I got looks like an old lady's pajama top! Very disappointed."
2.0,Laser itches snags pantyhose
2.0,This hoodie was fine and the color was perfect. Except it gave me a rash all over my arms!
2.0,"Way too large, material also stretches out. Order DOWN!"
2.0,"This item was not what the picture looked like, the black around the &#34;Girlfriends Are Better Than Therapy&#34; was a &#34;Hit and Miss Application&#34;<br />The letters were hard to read, and the back of the &#34;Girlfriends Are Better Than Therapy&#34; had black marks on it. VERY POOR Quality,<br />it was going to be a gift, but sent it back, so I had to pay postage to get it, and postage to return it!"
2.0,"Good shirt for the price. I purchased the shirt because it said good fit for athletic build. I 6’3 235lbs. The shirt is very tight and don’t try lifting your arms over your head(adjust the collar) with that said good quality shirt, wish they had a XXL"
2.0,"The mask is everything they say it is, but it is very small"
2.0,"Not as cute as the photos and has some static cling. Purchased to wear casually on a cruise, but will more than likely not take it."
2.0,The Dress was too small and i bought it a size bigger than my actual Size.. I feel the way it was made is what makes the dress not fit properly..
2.0,I can't even get these halfway up my thigh. I'm a size 10 and there is no hope of these fitting. What a bummer. Wish I would have read the other reviews before buying these.
2.0,"The top is nice, but it's not as long as I thought it would be from the pictures.  The fit is good, but I won't be wearing it.  As the cost to return the item from Australia, is to expensive, I'll be giving this to a much shorter pal."
2.0,not worth get fits loss and not great
2.0,Lens popped out after one use.
2.0,It was not at all what I was expecting.  Very tiny and I thought they were made very differently.  Disappointed.
2.0,They are nice tanks the only thing that would make them a lot better is if they were longer instead of so short
2.0,This dress is nice but runs large.
2.0,not like original I have
2.0,I had these gloves and after 1 day of work the rubber between the thumb and index finger started to peel off. After 1 week of medium use the rubber on the palms fell off and there was only rubber left on the finger tips and back of the hands.<br /><br />Overall they are decent cut resistant gloves but not impressed with the rubber and therefore the grip.
2.0,"The belt was as described, however, it is difficult to use.  Found it nearly impossible to release belt.  Resorted to just pulling down slacks!  Completely unacceptable!  I returned it for a refund."
2.0,Cute but quality lacking for my taste.
2.0,Very small for 11 yr old
2.0,After putting in the dryer the letters stick on each other:/
2.0,"These aare exactly what I was looking for, however, the silicone strip on the underside don't help at all.  Within 15 minutes of putting one on, it slid off.  I'm very disappointed."
2.0,Liked the color..... but all the Golden glitter would rub off easily... quality not good
2.0,Will not let me take a picture. My ring was broken when I received it in the mail.
2.0,It was fine except for being too long.
2.0,"These earrings were perfect and exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, one fell out the first time I used it. For the money I spent, I can't believe I've already lost one. I wasn't doing anything physical just going about my day to day."
2.0,"I got 3 of these to wear with leggings this fall/winter.  The green is more limey than say, Christmas green.  The neck is very wide and the fabric is thin to the point of see-through.  In all, I wish I returned it."
2.0,A Christmas gift She did NOT like them. I was so embarrased
2.0,"Zippers are not heavy duty. If too much pressure applied when closing or opening, zipper will snag"
2.0,"The shoe was cute, but was a tight fit around the leg. There was no adjusting in this shoe. If you wore it you would have to unbutton it in order to wear it."
2.0,Very thin and transparent no way to wear without shorts.
2.0,The way that this bralette was crochet/sewn together is very unflattering.<br />Especially if you're petite and have a smaller bust.<br />I wouldn't recommend buying.
2.0,"I purchased this heavier, somewhat more expensive than your average single person, umbrella  because I was heading to visit my son who was in an area that was getting heavy rain. The ad info states reinforced and wind proof. It was easy to open but muscle-challenging to close, but the main thing was that as soon as I opened it in the windy rain it turned inside out and was useless.  Not worth it to return."
2.0,"I have owned Casio watches for years.  They are low-priced and accurate, but the last two have broken.  The supports that hold the band break off so you are left with a pocket watch.  If they could make the plastic a little stronger I would be well satisfied with the product."
2.0,"This isn't very good quality. It runs large under the arms. The waist elastic is awkward and bunched up. The hem and cuff stitching is doubled and visible. This is a sign of a cheap garment. The fabric is OK, but the dress is not simple, but unflattering. If I were pregnant it would be OK, but I'm not, and if you have a nice figure. this dress hides it. My husband said I looked like I was singing in the Mormon Tabernacle choir. I purchased the black in the long sleeve. Also had loose threads. Length not as listed. I returned it."
2.0,"Attractive, but, elastic band is tooooo tight! If it wasn’t so tight, it would be 5 stars."
2.0,The rubber gets weird and gnarly after only 1 week of normal wear.
2.0,"I ordered two of these sunglass pouches after I lost a very nice pouch. The fabric feels very cheap, but the pouch is large enough for my big sunglasses. I suspect that the cord won't hold up long. These are good enough until I find a better quality pouch. I would not buy again."
2.0,Dress runs really big. I was very disappointed
2.0,"- I usually wear a medium to large, this suit is too tight and clings in all wrong spots. Out of the bag it showed discolorations, like rubbed in dust or dirt. when selecting 'return' , I got a message from the seller that they would discount me 30% if would keep the suit. when sending it back they will refund me the purchase price and deduct the return shipping fee from it( I already paid for shipping to me)  I will make sure not to deal with this seller again."
2.0,Cute outfit but its missing the headband : (
2.0,I like the look of the dress I wish it had cotton blend for comfort I very much dislike the fabric it gives a static in the cold :(
2.0,The bracelet keeps coming unhooked and I almost lost it due to it unhooking.
2.0,The material feels like work out clothes. The color is off. I'll add pictures before it's returned
2.0,"This material is really thin, like a very low nap terry cloth.  You cannot see through real velvet, but my photos clearly show you can easily see through this “cape”.  I plan to return it."
2.0,I wear a large and ordered an XL. WAY TOO SMALL. There is NO stretch to this hoodie AT ALL!! Very disappointed! The only good thing about this hoodie is the color.
2.0,Very cute when it's finally in. Very hard to clasp and I bought the package of three for the gold one but it broke as I was trying to unclasp it. It took me forever to get in.
2.0,the arms were way too snug...the overall fit is uncomfortable..
2.0,"Not sure I was sent the correct item, the color was much darker and the material is heavy like a T shirt. May return"
2.0,More of less
2.0,"If you're looking for a pretty and cheap necklace then this is perfect. I thought it was a glass teardrop bead with the silver overlay (which would have been great). Instead it was a flat piece of, what feel like, plastic. Maybe I missed where it was described that way but it ended up looking cheap rather than elegant. I think the design is great but it could be better."
2.0,"It's a rough mold, lightweight and cheap feeling. I love feather items, but it's really lacking in texture and makes me think of something a kid gets out of a 50 cent toy machine."
2.0,"The blouse i received has buttons, but nothing in which to fasten them. So it gapes open. Can this be replaced? I also dont see any way to contact the seller to notify them of this, other than to return it. But I dont want to receive another one that isnt as the pictures describe."
2.0,I would never order these again.
2.0,It looks 100 times better advertised than in person - it's shape is weird and unflattering
2.0,Trash. Bought 2 sizes down and still no compression. Any smaller and the underarm seam would be digging in. I will keep them as undershirts but they are not at all effective as compression shirts.
2.0,"First, it is very long, hence cumbersome. I can't imaging anyone needing such a long strap.<br />Then it is the snap spring lock.  My first one stopped working after two days: it just stayed open.  Then I use the second one.  After about a month, it also stopped working: The lock appears to stay closed, but the phone always slipped outside (hence often fell on the floor)."
2.0,Barely even glow after holding near bright lights.
2.0,The compression was so tight that they actually hurt to wear.
2.0,"This dress looks pretty in the picture and the design is good. The execution is, however, not great. The fabric was very rough, more yellow than champagne and it just did not look like the picture. The price is way too high for the quality."
2.0,You can barely read the engraving
2.0,"Por favor especifiquen cuando sea reducido a la talla origina, he comprado en otras ocasiones la misma talla y marca y está no es la talla correcta, es más chica"
2.0,The bottom fit fine but the top was too loose. It did not support my breast at all. I brought it for my anniversary trip and was very disappointed that i had to purchase another swimming suit
2.0,"Cheap,cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap!  It looks like if I wore it it would turn my neck and chest green!  Not very pretty."
2.0,"Didn't care for this sweater, cuterin amazAmazon picture, Margaret Porath"
2.0,Jacket runs small and the inside arm seam was not sewn.
2.0,This is not<br />Sweat shirt material. It's some sort of<br />Cheap shiny crap. Not a sweat shirt at all.
2.0,Broke pretty easy. I just took it apart for the charms tbh. It is a pretty bracelet though!
2.0,"0 distressing , and material was so cheap"
2.0,Snugged  from the top and to short on the waist but I used a short jean jacket over it and used it for the event.
2.0,"I wanted to like this garment since I usually buy this brand, but this particular bra was not for me. It fit just fine around my bust but the cups were roomy and loose, I know I don't have big .... but come-on! get the padding right. Anyways, no-thank you."
2.0,Runs small. An it sucks because I loved this shirt. So if your a bigger in size dont bother runs very small. It's a good quality but just runs small
2.0,The bag appears to be larger in the picture. It does not hold much and it already split at the seams.
2.0,usually I have to remove a few links out of a watch band or have a few holes to spare on  similar watch bands.  This on is snug on the buckled at the longest length. Any mane with an average size wrist may find it a bit too tight.
2.0,Runs very small for a 2xl
2.0,"If the ties were actually 3.5 inches wide as advertised, they would be a lot better.  But they are barely over 3 inches wide and generally skimpy.  Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Hinges are pretty loose and can be slightly tightened but are glued on to the frame.  Hinges are not the same stiffness- one you have to push open or closed and the other swings with slight movement
2.0,Too thin. you can see light thru it. sent it back.
2.0,It is ok. Definitely not something I would buy again
2.0,"The hook comes apart from the hook base (at the pivot/swivel point) every time I use it, causing the case itself to come unattached from whatever It have it hooked to, and fall to the ground. I finally had to superglue the hook and base together. It is no longer able to pivot, but at least I won't lose my expensive prescription sunglasses"
2.0,"I wanted to like these.  They were inexpensive, and part of a costume.  The lens popped out and we cannot get it to pop back in.  They lasted the night we needed them, but I cannot recommend them to anyone wanting to use them as actual sunglasses."
2.0,This is cute but it’s very large and doesn’t fit the way it look in the pictures. But it’s an alright beach cover-up.
2.0,"Zippers on the pockets are sharp as can be. uncomfortable... maybe the next design could be without metal zippers, maybe just a pocket without zippers."
2.0,"Cute, but not a good fit. The dress is kind of boxy and the sleeves are are long and tight.<br />Bought a size small and it did not fit my daughter 5’2 113lbs"
2.0,Ran very small and material is very thin. Ended up giving away.
2.0,Nice but didn't fit
2.0,"Has an odor, cheap buttons, returned."
2.0,Not usable as a hat unless your head is the size of a 8 year old . its made to be used as a wall hanging . very disappointed
2.0,"Very pretty choker, but the little charm is made of plastic and broke off less than a minute after I put it on. On top of that, it is so small that it just barely fit me. Even on the loosest link of the chain it still feels tight."
2.0,"This is very large.  I didn't care for it simply because when it is so big, it doesn't even come close to having an appearance of being real diamonds.  Kinda cheesy."
2.0,"This arrived broken,  we are trying to fix it now for my heart broken daughter."
2.0,"Says hand wash, but I risked it in the washing machine. String fell out; could've used a knit at the ends. Pretty simple that a makeshift one with fabric and cock ring would work just as well."
2.0,Legs are way longer than shown.  Very unflattering in crotch area.  Looks like a clown suit.
2.0,Wife wore it twice and the charm fell off
2.0,One of the bags ripped within the first couple times I used it and it only had two 2-liter sodas in it so it wasn't even close to the 50lb weight limit.  Was disappointed.
2.0,"Very bad quality dress. Plus the added fabric at the neck was way off the pattern, which showed up enough to make this dress look even worse."
2.0,Pros:- The goggles case n extras (though) not used.<br /><br />Cons:-<br />The goggles are small for adults. It's good for teenager and kids.<br />The cap is  not a latex one and stretch cloth is low quality. N obviously not meant for adults.<br /><br />Bottomline:- An okay purchase meant only for kids or teenagers.
2.0,Hole in one sock. Didn’t last long. So sad! Cause they were too cute!
2.0,The heel was a little to high for me and it was too narrow for my feet.
2.0,"Love the style, and it's okay, but material and workmanship is low quality.<br />Seems to run larger to true size."
2.0,I actually love the dress but it's too small. I got an XL. I'm 200 pound 5'8.
2.0,These liners were not no show for me. I like ones that do not come up so high on your foot. So that you cannot tell that I have them on. But if you are one that does not mind that then you will like these. Because other than that they were very comfortable and they fit well on my feet.
2.0,"It was too big all around.  Not flattering in the least.  Too big, too long and the neckline was not flattering either.  I really love the pattern but this was a big miss.  5 feet 143lb usually wear a 12P.  I love the pattern but pelagic doesn't seem to cater to my size.  It's too bad because I am the type of person that once I find something I like I buy it in all the colors."
2.0,"T-shirt but NOT what is pictured. Maybe after a year of wearing it and 50 washes it will have the look that is represented in the photo. But this is a brand spanking new looking t-shirt that has NO cotton in it what-so-ever, it's stretchy, thickish, spandexy, type material. I give it 2 stars because the color is true, it fits well, is soft and it has a nice V neck and if it was what I had ordered, great... but it is NOT what I ordered and... NOT... NOT what is represented in the photos. At first I was going to keep it but the truth is if I'd seen the t-shirt (I received) in the store, I would NOT have bought it and I'm tired of the false advertising that is allowed on Amazon (especially for clothes). I'm NOT keeping it 'just because it's close enough' NO. NO. NO. It's not what is being advertised. ENOUGH Amazon!! Make your vendors advertise the REAL item!!! We should ALL return EVERY item that is falsely represented... They're going back!<br />p.s. I ordered 3 colors, two (navy and purple), which came a few days ago and were NOT at all what was represented (i.e. the above review) and one (turquoise) came today and it was a soft cotton, with the sleeves and neckline the same as the photos. So, what's up?? Same site, same company?? but different t-shirts! What is up with that???"
2.0,It stops at my ankles and I'm only 5'4''. The most disappointing thing is the kneck and arm holes are much smaller then expected. I'm going to keep it but probably only wear as a swim coverup.
2.0,Didn’t look the same when I received it
2.0,"Purchased red w-white polka dots. The dress itself is cute for light wear, for sure going to wear to Disneyland for funskies under the SoCal sun - but the pocket arrived with a huge hole. Not cool. But it’s more work to send back - so I’ll sew it up myself & make it work vs shipping back, once I wash it (as it’s not out of the bag ready to wear - very stiff)"
2.0,the cut isn't the same as in the picture
2.0,This looked very cheaply made.
2.0,Only came with 5 and not 6
2.0,I loved the pearls. But the clasp would open and the necklace fell off.
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. I am 5'11' and 175lbs. I figured they would fit small so I ordered the 2XL...when it was  received it was too small. I had to return it for a 4XL. It is fairly comfortable when standing, but sitting is another thing. Definitely order bigger than you think with this product."
2.0,My daughter really likes the way they fit and are very comfortable but the reason i am giving them a 2 star is because they came with holes already.
2.0,"Too big in legs, but the seem still is visible and pulling apart."
2.0,"It looks good in pictures, but when I got it, it's very light and small. I took too long to open the package."
2.0,They only look good on one side. I didn't realize the pattern was only on one side.
2.0,As odd as it sounds the zipper is really cheaply made. It’s hard to zip and makes a horrible noice when doing so . I wear either a medium or large in clothes and the large I ordered juuuust fits( almost too small)
2.0,"Product doesn’t look like picture, not as cute."
2.0,They are very comfortable but not touchscreen gloves.
2.0,"The sandal fit according to size, but I found the rubber very hard.  When it pressed against my foot and between the first and second toe, it was so painful that I couldn't wear them.  I just threw them away.  The rubber is not soft; I guess that is what I expected from my past experience with flip-flops.  Maybe I have a delicate feet, but don't buy these sandals if you are expecting to have soft rubber material."
2.0,This definitely is not true to size. It goes half way around me
2.0,"I expected it to be as shiny as the image. It is dull and has gold zippers and no placket on the pockets. I’m disappointed, but don’t feel like the hassle of returning, re-ordering and waiting for another that may still be wrong. Also feel that for the price, it could be better quality."
2.0,"Beautiful watch, but didn't work had to return it."
2.0,Very cheaply done
2.0,"The size was fine, it was much shorter than expected."
2.0,Good product but not true to size. Hoping for a seamless exchange
2.0,"I've never worn it. It arrived stiff, was stiff after washing, totally uncomfortable -- which I could have endured, but the belt sent was wayyyyyy too small. I ordered an XL if I remember correctly and the belt was suited to a Medium if not a Small. Utterly useless. Now I've lost weight and it's too big to wear ... so into the giveaway bag it goes. :'(<br /><br />Strongly recommend NOT buying from these ""fly-by-night"" b/s ""companies"" on Amazon that ship from China, Taiwan, etc."
2.0,"I got these pants in black and I absolutely love them, unfortunately the lighter color does not look as good as it doesn’t quite hide all my imperfections like the black does. And since I’m a huge procrastinator, it is now too late for me to return them. 😭"
2.0,plastic nose piece came off within one day.
2.0,"The gloves are very soft, fit nicely and do keep my hands pretty warm.  They are great if you don't do anything in them.  But if you have to clear off your car of snow and ice, shovel a sidewalk, pump gas, handle grocery bags in and out of your car, or any other routine winter activities, they do not hold up.  They pill, and are starting to ravel in several areas and feel like they're getting thinner - all within a couple of weeks.  For the price, I expected them to last more than a few weeks as I've gotten a lot more wear out of the $1 ones, even though they are not as soft.  So if you're just walking outside and not actually using your hands on anything, they're good - otherwise don't waste your money."
2.0,"Cheaply made, wouldn't buy again."
2.0,"Looked good and fit well out of the box, but started pilling after one wash with little white fuzzys all over ruining the nice navy color."
2.0,"I can only get it to fit two ways, instead of the multiple options shown. It would probably fit better, and do more if my breasts were smaller, but I don't know for sure."
2.0,"These Bling CZ Fleur De Lis Hoop Earrings were very pretty when I received them, but I ended up sending them back. Good value for the money, but they were way too heavy. Post was huge for the hole in my ear and I was not able to wear them."
2.0,"I like the material for work, but the elastic digs in and gives me a pooch"
2.0,"The color has a yellowish tint to it and a small stain is on the front. Also, the zipper sticks. Not happy. 😔"
2.0,Runs small and very see through
2.0,I find it difficult to believe this is 100% cotton. It looks & feels like 100% polyester. I bought it to ice dye. Had to send it back.
2.0,Was not at all what I expected. I bought it for a job interview but I would be so embarrassed to wear this..
2.0,Broke in less than a week. Total bummer.
2.0,Good quality work hat but not for someone with long hair or braids this is not the cap for it
2.0,"The material is kind of raincoat-esque, like it's plastic. It is also see through so not a good dress."
2.0,Had to return as the post was out when they arrived.
2.0,Straps were broken within 2 weeks of using the 3rd largest sized bag. And it wasn't even being used daily. I only gave it 2 stars bcuz the material looked good.
2.0,Great suit. Love the buckle but no support in top.
2.0,"I ordered it to replace the one I lost. The picture looks like the one I used to have but the actual ring doesn’t look like the picture. It looks like a wave, but it looks like a wave a child drew."
2.0,Love the fit! Hate how separate the pockets are. Sad they look weird with my figure.
2.0,Terrible material. Returned.
2.0,it arrived and the flower was broken in half
2.0,"This bracelet is really cute and I get compliments all the time on it. However, after just about 7 days (maybe) of wearing it just going to class (nothing that would actually cause it to be damaged).. it broke. I can still probably wear it, but one of the pieces untied or something and now it's missing a piece. The bracelet is very symmetrical and looks weird with the missing piece now.... I'm sad. I only got a week of wear and I really like it."
2.0,Too large for my ears- returned
2.0,Measurements totally wrong! Small is like a medium/large. Fabric is super thin.
2.0,It runs smaller than there size chart says thought I was getting a boy 10 or 12 and it barely fits him it is more like a boys 6.  The size chart is very confusing but the shirt is a nylon feel ans the print is nice on both sides he loves it even though it’s kinda tight.
2.0,"Does not work as advertised, it might reduce some glaring, that is it"
2.0,Cute but not worth $119 dollars. Incredibly tiny with the thinnest chain. Might break if I turn my head wrong. Symbol is also smaller than I assumed it would be.
2.0,"The Andes II Tourer is a stylish, warm and well fitting jacket. Unfortunately, on my 6th ride wearing the jacket, the zipper stuck and several teeth broke off in the process of clearing the jam rendering the jacket unusable.  I have always worn First Gear jackets.  The First Gear zippers are much heftier and more suitable securing a heavy motorcycle jacket."
2.0,The print was so much more tacky than I expected... It looks like shiny adhesive design like a print t-shirt would have.  I must not have read closely enough because I was hoping for this to be embroidered.  I don't think I will ever wear this because it will look cheap and childish.
2.0,first off this so called limited edition is the same as the other watch golden eyes - as a collector I Like it as it as unique but not for 550.00 or 750.00 - you can buy this watch on overstock for 325.00 - that is a fair price - this so called limited edition is just a way for you to pay more money . 325.00 is more then fair
2.0,Kind of thin/cheap material. I won't order this brand again.
2.0,"This top is not what I would call true, bright white. It definitely has a yellow-ish tint. (See picture where I laid it next to another white top ordered from amazon). The shorts on the model must be really high waisted or something because the top didn’t even cover my navel. I found the elastic holding up the “neckline” pretty tight. The ruffled straps are CUTE! But I will be returning it."
2.0,"After less than a month of use, this product tore with not a lot dangling from the card holder. Very not impressed with the product."
2.0,"This was MUCH too small, I barely got it on. Amazon says I ordered a Large, but the tag on the skirt said XL, so I'm not sure what size I tried on. My measurements are 39&#34; bust, 31&#34; waist, 42&#34; hips for reference. I'm desperate to find more girly clothes with pockets so I'll probably give the next size up a try."
2.0,It is too small for the kids of 4 years!
2.0,I like Kut jeans except my bum hangs out whenever I sit down in this cut
2.0,I personally don't think it's worth $39.99. I thought it would be a little bit thicker. The coat seem to be well made. Not sure about the size yet.
2.0,This shirt is good quality but it could seriously fit my husband it’s so big.
2.0,"The pegs on the straps that are supposed to fit into the holes on the stems of the glasses doesn't fit.  Out of the 5 straps included with the package one has fit and stayed in place so far.  The straps themselves are a good quality, they are thick and durable.  Unfortunately they do not fit the particular glasses that we have."
2.0,Well made socks. Did not work for me. They were too tight in the toes and calf.
2.0,Extremely short and opens in the front when walking exposing way too much
2.0,"Great style, but size runs small on me and the black fabric was too shiny for me.  Reluctantly returned."
2.0,"Initially, I thought this product was satisfactory however, after about 15 months, the buckle end separated from the strap rendering it useless. I do not even wear this every day. I've never had another watchband fall apart so quickly."
2.0,This fits true to size but looks pretty much nothing like the picture. It's chiffon with cheap lace on the hem. The key hole back is about three inches short. disappointed.
2.0,To small don't zip all the way and followed size chart
2.0,Purchased for my husband. After a few months the magnet pulled out of the middle and they no longer work.
2.0,"Looks great out od the box. Little stiff, but softened up after a day or two. 2 stars because the stitching compleatly ripped apart after only a week of use."
2.0,Not as attractive in person
2.0,Material is great! It didn’t feel cheap - even for the $10 sales price - unfortunately it was way too small  - to give you context - I’m 5ft 8in - 160lbs - usually wear a size 10 pant/medium/small shirts and pants and it was way too firm around my waist/behind area. I’d be careful if you’re unsure. Would recommend sizing up just in case.
2.0,Sent it back as it had a hole in it at the seam<br />The fit would have been good otherwise
2.0,"Cute but unrealistic for baby, no buttons at bottom for easy diaper changes"
2.0,VERY small but sexy. I'm a busty gal so it really doesn't do me any favors as it is NOT AT ALL stretchy material. I would recommend this for smaller busted gals.
2.0,"I am 5'6"" and 150 pounds, 34B chest. I ordered a medium and it was a little too small. The fit was terrible- the front gapped and the bottom shorts part was SO loose you could see my butt. The material is extremely cheap. I returned it."
2.0,Cheap material.  Length is much shorter than the product description.
2.0,Looks cheap. More of an orange tone. Earrings bend easily. Not worth the money .
2.0,"Way too small,  not hemmed"
2.0,The material is crap. Feels like it’s made out of Halloween costume.
2.0,I was so excited to order and recieve this outfit but it did not live up to the hype. Poor quality. It fits weird too. Idk exactly how to describe it other than it was not as expected.
2.0,The clasp does not hold.  It fell off within seconds of having it on. The toggle should have been made bigger so it won't slip through.
2.0,Cute but don’t stay in place and not really great for a workout
2.0,It does not look like the same quality as the purse I am using it on.  Not as nice as the photo I ordered from.
2.0,"I wish there was a comparison on the length because It was way to small for me, it was very tight around my neck. I gave it to my coworker that is much more thinner than me, and she loved it, the charm sat right underneath her collarbone. I was observing the chain it the quality is worse that some I would find at Clair’s."
2.0,These were cute but huge!
2.0,The material is ok. But is not one size fits all. I am a size 12 and it was too small.
2.0,I found it hard to use.
2.0,This product stamped writing is not clear and in some places not even readable.  One needs a magnifying glass to read - disappointing.
2.0,"Not really made well. The finish is uneven in spots and it doesn't look real by any stretch. Inexpensive though, so you might still like what it is for the price."
2.0,These need to come in a larger size for plus size people
2.0,"Really cute dress- I ordered in a large but it was way too tight in the shoulders and chest. I’m 36DD and usually wear a L in tops/dresses for reference. Would not recommend for larger busts or anyone who is tall. I’m 5’6 and it was way too short. Gave the dress to my friend who is 5’7 and size S-M and it fit her perfectly, but she was sent home from work for it being too short lol. So keep this in mind before purchasing."
2.0,Definately get a size up. I'm an 8 and ordered a 10 ( because of the reviews) and it fit perfectly! ...until i got to the top. It's way too loose and boxy. Sucks because it is amazing from the waist down. :( Returned it the same day I ot it
2.0,I normally wear an XL in everything and I could barely get these shorts over one leg.  Disappointed because I was on vacation and was looking forward to wearing them but now I have take the time to send them back.
2.0,The ball parts break easily after wearing for a couple of weeks.
2.0,Gaiter is a bit long and is very small. The ear loops are slits I the slide of gaiter and pulls on the ears. Too small for male and a bit tight for female user. Filter does not stay in place while trying to pull gaiter on. Does not meet our needs.
2.0,Bottom edge looks very unfinished
2.0,"The shirt is a cute graphic and it was centered. Wash inside out for these type of shirts. I washed in cold, dried on nearly cool and while it was a bit damp, I noticed it had shrunk and the color was very faded. I washed this shirt with a few other t shirts like this.  Even after trying to stretch it and block it, it was still too small. We were shocked.  Buyer beware, size up for sure. Perhaps hand wash and I hear there is a laundry soap for dark clothing. (???)  I even used a very gentle soap called (Nellie’s. it’s fantastic, it only takes a tiny scoop and lasts forever! Cents per load)  I hope this was helpful.  So size up, and gently wash and perhaps air dry. 🙂 I couldn’t get the below height and weight too work, but my son is 6ft tall and about 240 pounds. He usually wears a large shirt. Honestly I can’t remember if I ordered a large or XL, because if I try too look it up, I will lose all information I’ve put in here."
2.0,"Extremely difficult to get snapped into place after putting it in the septum. I like the style, very light weight and comfortable. But have to leave it unlatched, since last time it was nearly impossible to get out."
2.0,Product came with bleached spot. This was supposed to be a gift. So that kind of stinks.
2.0,"Heavy, thick and extra big"
2.0,Arrived flat in an envelope.  The look of the hat was disappointing Because the kids like the flat bill with high arch in hat.
2.0,"My favorite color is blue and my daughter-in-law's is purple.  I thought this would be a perfect special gift from me to her, however, when I received it, it didn't look like this photo.  The bracelet looked purple, not blue and purple.  The smallest bits of blue on this were so faded it looked silver.  I think this photo is a misrepresentation of what you really get.  Very disappointed."
2.0,Product material is more plastic than leather. But if you need a cute clutch for the beach it will do the trick
2.0,Didnt lile the fact that it doesn't come with the battery pack so i dont know how it works yet  because i have to order one
2.0,broke them while trying to close them. Wish that hand's happened
2.0,Only wore it 4 times and the chain randomly broke.. its cheap
2.0,"Size was much too big, but nice material"
2.0,You get what you paid for. Very cheap material which broke rather fast but it was for a low price
2.0,Purchased in 2017.  Mild use but constant during pacific NW rainy winters.  One boot is now leaking.
2.0,I purchased these pajamas in hope tod ins a comfortable pair for a good price. I washed them before I wore them- they did not wash well. Strings  are now hanging off after the first initial wash. The size was smaller. I usually wear a medium- they fit but were fitted- I don’t want fitted pajamas. I like looser pajamas. Not super satisfied. Material was soft.
2.0,"Beware that size on packaging does not align with the size chart in the listing.  I am 5'6"" and ordered the medium/tall, but the tights were several inches too short. They were as opaque as advertised and a good weight for the price, so I still gave them two stars.  I've included a picture of the label as a size reference."
2.0,Not the best and very see throughish.
2.0,Think low quality
2.0,"The pendant itself is beautiful,But the chain it’s attached to is a cheap gun metal color, it does not go with the pendant at all.<br />Not worthy of giving as a gift unless you change the chain to a gold color one."
2.0,It was too big ... and the sizing was weird. I am 5'7 1/2&#34; tall weigh 138 pounds. Should of gotten a smaller size. But sending back was too $$ So going to attempt to fix it. Love the pattern of the dress. But the waist is high and the belt is very cheap. Like a thin ribbon. Does not hit where the waist it located..
2.0,"Too long and fabric was very stiff, not soft at all."
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter on March 5, 2021 and the Nike logo is already coming off. She's only worn it a handful of times for soccer. We've washed it once and let it air dry, so it didn't even go in the dryer. It's outside of the 30-day return window and the seller says they are unable to assist with ""customer damaged items"". We didn't damage it, it's coming apart on its own.<br /><br />She needs it for soccer so it looks like I'm buying another one, unfortunately. Definitely a waste of money and incredibly frustrating."
2.0,Tiny would not buy again.
2.0,This was difficult to get in and in the end I couldn't get it in my small ear.
2.0,I didn't like them because they are much bigger than they appear
2.0,"They are cute and beautiful but the sterling silver is NOT hypoallergenic which makes them completely unwearable for me.  I've literally worn Claire's earrings for months on end before and been fine, but THESE TARNISH and I'm getting a horrible ear infection after wearing them for a month or two.  They're all green and gross now, and my ears are suffering...! :("
2.0,Shirts run extremely small.
2.0,Seams came apart after I washed it 1 time.
2.0,"Loved the look of this and had such high hopes. Unfortunately, the elbow patches are completely turned around to the front. I'm so sad."
2.0,Didn't really stay in position as you'd expect.  Good in theory though.
2.0,Order a large fit like Like a size M
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress because I loved the peacock design. Unfortunately the boning and the fit of the corset was awful on me. With a larger bust, the top of the corset gaped ridiculously–I guess once it goes out around the bust it doesn’t come back in... I do have another dress with a corset back like this and while it’s an nice dress, the boning and structure of the corset really doesn’t flatter my figure. Perhaps if I had someone else to lace me up it could be done more strategically, but when it’s just me, even when it’s as tight as it gets, everything just looks lumpy. I was sad to return this one."
2.0,"This dress is extremely sheer, and it's simply subpar compared to other dresses I've ordered from Amazon. Even with a slip you can see the outline of my body/underwear."
2.0,Its not very wide and writing inside is too small to read.  It looks much larger.  I ordered from mint and lilly paying lots more.  Only to find out these are exact bracelets.  Something she done about this!
2.0,Delivery was awesome but it is too small. I loved the design but I wanted something bigger.
2.0,They did not come with the bra and panties and there's nowhere to buy those exact ones to match the colors.
2.0,"The dress is cute but it definitely runs small, so size up!"
2.0,It's really tight on my arms I wish I ordered a size bigger.
2.0,turned brown from the tail in the 4th time i wear it
2.0,Cute. Bigger in person than I thought they’d be. Cons are that they are super foggy smudgy lenses. I used cleaner both wet and dry and nothing worked. They broke in half. Super frustrating.
2.0,Don't seem well made. After one wear the pattern is fading. Pretty thin material. Might might ok pajama pants but won't wear them otherwise. Had really hoped they were more like leggings but they aren't.
2.0,it does not stay snapped
2.0,Came super tangled and very cheap looking
2.0,"Wouldn't stay put and I have to order large hats, meaning I have a big head. I don't understand how these are to be kept up on face. They kept sliding down under nose, and with COVID and you don't have your nose covered you might as well not be wearing a mask at all. Disappointed. They went back."
2.0,"The item that arrived is not the same as in the picture. The item that Is pictured shows 5 gems per earring. Mine arrived with just 3.  It is still very beautiful and dainty and I will keep it, but it is definitely not what is pictured."
2.0,Very loose fit
2.0,"Junk, poor sewing,  Unhemmed in several places. Pants and shirt are short"
2.0,"Very cute color. Although they were very long I believe a 35 plus inseam l, so unfortunately had to send back"
2.0,Had to return these as they don’t stay up on thick thighs
2.0,Shorts were exactly as pictured.  I was really hoping this would fit but it didn't. The legs were fine but everything else was too tight. I suggest ordering one or two sizes up if you don't have a flat tummy or are over a size 8.
2.0,"Runs too small, got a 12, looks more like an 8?!?"
2.0,too small doesn't fit
2.0,Could be cheaper and do not feel the aloe like other infused socks!
2.0,"I’m not sure that it was a denim, unless that has changed in the past few years. The fabric of the product was more of a polished cotton than a light denim.  The picture implies that the pant leg is longer they actually.  I’m 5’7” and the we’re 2 inches above my shoes.  Mind you my legs are not unusually long.  I think the jeans are probably for someone 5’4” to appear like their pictured."
2.0,the cowl neck is very unflattering if you have a smaller chest. just will not lay right. won’t be wearing it out anytime soon
2.0,Cute shirt but when it arrived it was insanely thin and falling apart with strings hanging all over. Super short too:/
2.0,Was not made with children in mind. There is no pocket or anything for the filter to go in. The filter literally is just suppose to sit on the inside of the mask. High chance that it will fall out or come out of place especially dealing with children. Cute design though but I’m sending it back
2.0,"I really loved the gloves, I'm super disappointed they dont work anymore. I'm very confused about how gloves can randomly stop working with a touch screen? It was perfect when I first got them and now I can't even unlock my phone."
2.0,"Very pretty, seems like a nice value ...problem is the material is so scratchy that wife found it impossible to wear. Was returned for full refund."
2.0,The colors are really pretty HOWEVER the orange is not really orange color but more of a coral color .<br />The yellow band came in damaged didn’t send back because I threw out the package in where it came in .
2.0,I wouldn’t of bought these if I knew they were See through and they’re so paper thin and they come to my ankle I though they be alittle longer
2.0,They were a little to big for my face so had to give them to my husband but beautifully made and of course love the pittie. Had no personal use for them
2.0,"My wife loved this necklace so much. However the plating came off of the chain after only a week, turning her neck green. If you purchase this, don't use the chain."
2.0,Material is rather thin/transparent in this color
2.0,I wish I hadn’t bought this. Looks cheap and too “new”- not as pictured in the worn vintage vein I hoped for. Disappointed over all but the shirt is comfy and not worth the hassle of return. A sleep shirt now.
2.0,"I ordered 00g sadly these just fall right out, Beautiful stone plugs, just wish they fit.  I wear 00g on all my other plugs/screw backs, with no problems, but these are just to darn small."
2.0,The size was too small. It wasn't even close to the size represented.
2.0,"Pro.. *beautiful color<br />  * with a fluffy underskirt to fill it would be really cute<br />Con... really short. Bought a sz 8 for my daughter that wears a sz7 and it's really short.  Tried it on my tiny 6 year old too,  and it still doesn't touch the floor like in the images. The photographer in me wishes it was the right length because it would photograph beautifully.  For the price definitely not worth it as is."
2.0,This house coat is just alright.  I don't like the front pockets or the collar.  It's a bit on the bulky side.
2.0,"The top is too narrow around the bottom and I hate the pants. They are really baggy and the legs and straight, it's not a good look. Probably won't buy any more since I've spent a lot of time trying to make them look normal, not to mention they are too short too and I'm not tall. The fabric is cheap and static."
2.0,"I like the slim fit. However, the shirt length was too small and has made it impossible to wear because the shirt keeps coming out."
2.0,"The material is not that thick, kind of plastic like- and the button broke off right when I tried it on... but I will still wear it- it's still nice"
2.0,My son loves these and they work great!<br /><br />edit<br />the lights stopped working after a month of wearing these about 3x a week. changed the batteries and only two of the lights worked again. what a waste
2.0,"Sbicca Kathy Wedge - The sole is slippery, not much traction while walking.  The front of the sole is too long, about half an inch longer than my toes.  I also didn't like the silver color, it is shinny like a mirror!  Overall quality looks cheap, may be I am expecting too much out of a shoes that is priced cheap."
2.0,"This definitely runs small! It does not drape like the picture and the sleeves stop around my elbows? I am only 5'5. The material is nice and thick but, it's not made for an average sized woman."
2.0,"Nice tank top but runs 2 sizes small, I'm afraid to wash! Otherwise cute and nice material."
2.0,Unfortunately my daughter thought these shoes were not very comfortable and has only worn them a couple of time. They are cute however.
2.0,Lost it two days after I got it cause the cover is loose
2.0,The material in this bag is very cheap
2.0,You get what you pay for. Looks cheap and phony
2.0,I ordered this dress because I loved the style. I was very disappointed with the fabric which was very thin and created a lot of static.
2.0,Was pretty cheap quality. Fit me kind of weird and the stitching came undone pretty quickly.
2.0,it breaks easy! be very careful with it
2.0,"I was looking for a glow in the dark necklace for my child's friend because she loves glow in the dark anything....Gave this to her for her bday, they tried it and nothing. We left it outside the sun, came back, nothing....she said it was pretty though, but it's still disappointing that it advertised as glow in the dark when it wasn't. Maybe we just got a defective one, I dont know."
2.0,I ordered it in white but got gray. In the picture I took a side by side photo of a white wig I already  own and the wig I got.<br />And the wig is so thin! You can see the hair net without even wearing it. In like the photo where it's full.<br />It's a shame Cuz I love the wig but the flaws are not forgiving.
2.0,If your big chested it might not fit. Plus the material was itchy when I put it on
2.0,Received it liked it opened it and clasp broke 😔
2.0,"This dress runs VERY small, I would say a 14 runs more like a 10.  The dress is very clingy, material wise as well.  On the picture the sequence looks so well placed and the dress looks elegant, I would not say that's how I felt when seeing it in person. I was going to be wearing this in a vow renewal, very glad I ordered so early on so I can find something else.  I would strongly advise against purchasing this dress."
2.0,what I received was a lot heavier (chunkier) then the picture shows. Really bummed. Got thrown in the jewelry box and will probably never get worn
2.0,"The +1 made reading text blurry, sadly."
2.0,Construction was very small..
2.0,I did not care for the fabric of this dress. It feels very plastic-y like a tarp and wrinkled terribly.
2.0,2 sizes smaller than advertised
2.0,"Washed it once and it shrunk :( only wore it twice, now it is too small for my 3 year old."
2.0,The top is ok but the bottoms do not fit right and do not look very good.  I'm going to have to find new bottoms to use with the top.
2.0,Pills after one wash. Ended up donating it after a few wears.
2.0,cute design but Too small and tight.
2.0,"These show when I wear flats. They wouldn't show in sperrys/keds/small girly sneakers. But for regular flats, they are still visible.<br />I still wear the nude ones, and I'll hunt for fully no show socks later on."
2.0,When they arrived the crystals had separated from the flower. They are ok. I wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,"Not what I expected, very small"
2.0,Not supportive and too loose
2.0,Its pretty. But too big for girl's piercing hole.
2.0,"I ordered a black pair and a grey pair, same style, and same size, and the grey are slimmer and dont have pockets and the black are baggy and have pockets. so weird. I wanted both pair to fit like the black pair ."
2.0,"The purse is cute when you carry it with the strap over the one shoulder and when holding it by the purse handles. However, when I attempted to convert it to use as a backpack, the purse did not fold right which made it look like I was trying to do something other than what it was designed for. Since the purse was advertised as a multi-use purse and I wasn't able to use it ""backpack style"", I will be returning it for a full refund.  :(  Otherwise, the purse is nice. It doesn't look cheap which is always a bonus."
2.0,They were bigger than expected. Wanted small one for 4 th ear hole
2.0,The socks look pretty which is the only advantage. They are thin which is ok for me but they do not feel like cotton at all!!! I was disappointed because I trusted the description which turned out to be lies. (((  I kept them only because my daughter liked them.
2.0,Much smaller than shown and won't stay in place
2.0,Poor quality. Made of mostly polyester. Too hot for summer.
2.0,"After 2 days, both studs had fallen off. Thankfully because of the design, the post remained in my tragus. Would NOT buy again or recommend"
2.0,Breaks easily. I got it caught on my blanket and it broke apart. Luckily my friend fixed it for me.
2.0,Too long and made for tall people
2.0,The shorts had an okay fit. It’s not flattering to the butt at all. After putting the shorts on the button came off.
2.0,"Cute but cheap, broke very quickly."
2.0,It is very cute but it runs very small.
2.0,"This is absolutely too tight to wear - gave it to my 6 year old.  If you have a normal sized head, this is going to fit like a tight glove.  If you are going to do anything that requires exertion while wearing this you better cut a hole so you can breath.  It really makes me wonder if Under Armour actually tests it products."
2.0,Had high expectations. They're buttery and super soft but I keep having to pull them up and they're xs lol. Maybe not the best pair for short girls
2.0,This dress is cute but it runs super super big . I ordered a small and it was huge on me.
2.0,"This is lovely and portable, but after two days of use, one of the metal links in the chain bent and warped, rendering it useless. Take care to only use this with a very lightweight purse."
2.0,"Length is great and the material is a very pleasant flannel, but I would definitely recommend sizing up for this one. I'm a size large pretty consistently. 5ft 7 170 lbs mostly in the hips and thighs...but the sleeves were snug and short, and i could only button the one button at the small of my waist. My hands got stuck in the tiny pocket openings, too lol. If I could do it over, i would buy an XL and probably be really happy with it. Right now I'm kinda bummed i can't wear it like an actual shirt."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:91e6b1ec71871cf93c79909d2e77cbdc]] I actually have extremely small wrists for an adult and these things just barely clasp. Since they are magnetic they don’t hold for more than 30 seconds before I turn my wrist the wrong way and they unclasp. My 8 year old claimed them.
2.0,"They were bigger than i exspected,much bigger."
2.0,Cheap material and see through.
2.0,"The setting was beautiful,but not knowing much about size the Pearl seemed way to big. Nice if it could of been smaller."
2.0,They stretched out after a few days to they look kind of silly now.
2.0,"I ordered this dress in green/L. The color is much more beautiful in person. However, the measurements listed are wrong. It lists the L as having a bust of 41.3"", but I measured and it's actually 36"" - a difference of over 5 inches. To me the L looks more like a US XS or maybe a S at the most. Returning due to fit, of course."
2.0,"These are comfy shoes.  They fit fine, the footbed is comfortable, the shoe is lightweight, they are inexpensive.<br />But I would not buy them again.  The plush polyester lining does not breath AT ALL, so these shoes make my feet disgustingly sweaty and moist.<br />The shoes themselves also reeked so strongly of off-gassing plastic when they arrived that I actually had to leave them outside on the porch for a week.  Ugh.  Toxic?  Smelled that way.<br />These shoes are now for short trips outside or when I’m running around the house in a bathrobe....they just aren’t great for all-day, every-day comfort."
2.0,"Dress is not as expected. The picture in the ad shows a Vneck dress, I did not receive this. Please see the picture I have shared to see the dress you will receive."
2.0,Not uncomfortable
2.0,"The material used is so-so. The zipper is especially of poor quality as pulling up or down usually snags, and feels like it won't last that long. The crotch seam is too low by about an inch or more. I can pull up the shorts further but then the waistline ends up being an inch or so above my waist. Walking around is ok but more leg movement beyond that is somewhat tight as it's made legs skinnier than mine."
2.0,Not as long as i expected
2.0,Poor quality for the price and not flattering.
2.0,wife has sensitive ears and they really bothered her to put on
2.0,"This band fell apart at the buckle several times while wearing it. I am not sure how safe to feel. I was able to reconnect it, but who knows when it will go again.  It is a good looking &#34;bling&#34; band though."
2.0,they came dirty
2.0,"Cheap and irregular fit. No support at all! The design is cute, but it could use some support in the waist just so they can stay up."
2.0,"Don't look like picture, cheaply made, not very soft.....should have spent more but 30.00 seemed reasonable for slippers."
2.0,NO printed info on HOW TO use this? Was at lost of what to do and how to use this wallet!
2.0,Pros: suit looks great. The way the top is cut it holds the girls firmly in place. Also the sizing they provided fit well also (so a 6-8 is a large.) just go by the higher not lower number. If you're a true size 8 the 8-10 will be too large.<br />Cons: today was the 3rd time I wore the suit. 1st time in an actual pool swimming and the underwire poked through. What a bummer!!!! Quality is terribly lacking.
2.0,The leather is very cheap quality. Wouldn't recommend
2.0,This top didnt fit at all and the bottoms where too small. Returned it the day I got it
2.0,They look nice but came in a random baggie with no size distention so you just have to rummage through the bag till you find the size your looking for
2.0,"The strap broke before we entered the stadium.  At that point,  I had worn it 5 minutes.  I have it 2 stars because the bags is roomy and the length of the strap was great for the cross body.. otherwise, it was a nightmare not having full use of the bag during the game.  Refund requested."
2.0,Zipper broke 2nd day It’s a lightweight zipper on a heavy coat.  makes no sense.  Arms are way to short for an average American  woman.  Defiantly China quality and sizing
2.0,"It has an adjustable strap, but you cannot make the hat Larger only smaller"
2.0,"Needed spare pair of shoes for full day of funeral activities when my heels became uncomfortable. The were a nice break, well padded so it didn't feel like other slip on, foldable flats but there is no support. Not sure if I'd purchase them had I tried them on before I bought them."
2.0,I was hoping for a little more. Fit a little tight in the chest and if i put my arms out straight tight in the armpits/ back as well. I could even deal with all that but the lenght was Really long! In the photos It shows it touching the knee but mine was Way past the knees almost to my ankles!!  I'm 5'2 135lbs ordered a size medium
2.0,"Too bad for a picture. I’m 5’5”, 125lbs, and bust is 34D. In athletic wear I like to wear size mediums so nothing is too snug.<br />BUT I’m this top was huge!<br />Also it had a built in braw with padding. The padding was removable, BUT the padded cups were white and it showed through the white shirt, like two tiny circles!<br />The fit of the top was so weird that I didn’t even want to bother ordering a smaller size."
2.0,This looked way too feminine on my husband's hand. We returned it.
2.0,Very cheaply made and runs SUPER SMALL
2.0,This is a very cheap quality case. The fabric which covers all the surface area was completely faded. It looks like it was kept in sun for a long time. The inner surface does not have any fabric at all. I will definitely be returning it.
2.0,I know it's cheap but I've ordered several pieces of costume jewelry and they exceed my expectations. The charms are made of cheap plastic and one arrived already off the bracelet.  The pearls are very obviously fake.  The picture is much better than the product.
2.0,"Looks better in ad picture. Material is very thin with barely and ""tummy control"". People mistake it for a sundress, not a bathing suit. Pattern is definitely more predominate in the picture."
2.0,"Loved the look, the material started to fall apart within a week , we had to put it away to save it from falling apart"
2.0,Dress came and immediately I wanted to try it on. when i took it out the bag the first thing I noticed was a really strange smell... Almost smelled like an old musty rag! At that very moment a button fell off. I decided well I can air it out and sew the button back on. I let the dress hang for a couple of days in hopes that that musty smell would go away... For the most part it did...I did get the button sewn on and fully made up and dressed... heading out of my house on new years eve 2 more of the buttons popped off. At this point I had to roll as-is because I was already running late. But outside of the smell and all the buttons popping off dress fit great. Its super form fitting which is how I like it!
2.0,"Makes everything dimmer, not brighter. Helpful on unlit roads and for dimming oncoming headlights. Do not use in urban areas!"
2.0,"this shirt is way too big and boxy, even the sleeves are big and boxy not like pictured, very disappointed"
2.0,The color on the watch face rubbed off after the first time on.
2.0,Wish you could reply to wanting a refund. They're nothing like I've bought before. Just a print on rayon stretch! No jean material what so ever!
2.0,"Looked cheap.  Didn't care for them, sending them back."
2.0,Not well made. Raveled after first wash.
2.0,"Too tight, but doesn’t even smooth anything out or do anything functional. They are also sort of low rise. I will be returning them for something else."
2.0,"Like the other reviews the fact that the ball has the screw on it to screw into the par is really annoying.<br />After reading the other reviews I made sure to tighten the balls as much as possible so they didn't fall off. Unfortunately I must have missed on since after 4 days I have already lost one of the balls. (Luckily the bar is still in).<br />However 3 of the 4 balls are working great.<br />They are not bad quality for the price, but I'll probably have to buy another one or two just to have replacement balls."
2.0,Not the greatest quality. Fit was a little small for an XL
2.0,It was made out of this uncomfortable straw.  I wouldn't buy this again. It looked cute but when I folded it then the tippy top had a little hole in it. It wasn't material that was sewed together. It poked at my head for a bit. I had to cut some of the straw so it doesn't make my head itch. It looks cute but it's not ideal material you want on your head.
2.0,The product DEFINITELY runs small. An XXL should be big on me and leave me room to breathe but it literally clings to the body and is tight.
2.0,"I wanted to love this.  The t-shirt fabric was soft and sort of slinky, the cut was flattering, and as a 5'10"" woman, it came down to right above my knees, which was a perfect fit for me.  I will say the pleats ended right under my bust, rather than how it is shown in the product pictures, but that ended up looking fine.  Whatever.  But the yellow was completely sheer.  Even with nude undergarments.  The place where the fabric was doubled because of the pleats was extra bright yellow and it was just so sheer everywhere else.  I also did see that the pleats were not finished at the bottom, as I'd seen in other reviewer's pictures, and I doubt they would have held up to a couple of washings.  I MIGHT try another color, but the yellow was unacceptable."
2.0,"Unfortunately, even though this wand was perfectly themed to match my daughter's Halloween costume, it is very flimsy and is now in 2 pieces.  At least she got to use it for the night."
2.0,Still fog glasses
2.0,Disappointed because it fell apart after a few months
2.0,The support is really weird.  It rises up after your toes instead of in the arch of your foot.  Not a big deal to get new insoles.  I really like how these shoes look but one shoe is too small in the toe region.  Just the one.  I tried wearing them in for a few months but it didnt really work.  For the price I feel you can do a lot better.
2.0,"Leather is nice, but the band will not stay secure under the strap that is supposed to hold it."
2.0,I have a small face so I figured this would fit properly.  The most awkward mask I have every worn
2.0,Waaayyyy smaller that anticipated..
2.0,These were much smaller than I figured they'd be... they barely go past the lobe of the ear when put on.
2.0,"Too small, too tight.  Waste of money!"
2.0,I didn’t really notice any of a difference using these for a couple weeks while I was gaming or watching a screen!
2.0,"The earrings are not what I was expecting based on the photos. They are not the same ones that are pictured on the model—they are smaller. This would have been fine but for the fact that the metal does not wrap all the way around the earring. This makes them look cheap, when they would otherwise be very cute. Very sad to have to return them."
2.0,gotta give 2 star review for receiving messed up product. the top lace on the shoe was completely smushed flat so that you couldnt put the shoe strong through it.
2.0,"Actually, one was a little tight and the other was waay too tight.  Poor quality control."
2.0,You have to stretch it out and even then it creeps up like a cone head. Hoping I can use it in the garden. Nothing like the model.
2.0,"Fits like a maternity dress.  The seam hits at a weird spot, not right under your breasts but not your waist.  I didn’t like the look.  However the material is soft and it felt comfy with pockets.  Just wish it sat/fell more appropriately.  I returned it"
2.0,"I heard rave reviews about these, but am really no impressed. I think they are itchy and not breathable/make me sweat when I am just lounging in them. They do ""hold me in"", which is nice, but not comfy."
2.0,Wasn't what I expected!!
2.0,There wasnt any protective hardware for the earrings. When they arrived they were extremely bent. I was very disappointed because they were so cute.
2.0,I do like the look of it. The band is hard to use for me. But the worst part is it loses time. I'll take it off for a day and I've lost a half hour. Not good.
2.0,I bought this for my nieces for tie dying using a fiber reactive dye we've used many times successfully. The color washed completely out so it's definitely some sort of synthetic.
2.0,The watch was to big and I couldn’t change the date
2.0,"With the cold of winter on its way, I decided to buy a scarf to help keep me warm. This is not the scarf to do so.<br /><br />The material is extremely thin. I can see through it despite it being black very easily. The size is wrong as well. Its too wide and not very long.<br /><br />In short, this isn't one for warmth, more for decoration. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I love the concept of this product but pretty frustrated so far.  The instructions say to rub on metal and if the cotton swab turns any shade of pink, nickel is present.  I rubbed on several items which I knew to contain nickel and the swab turned gray, not pink at all.  This was really confusing because I wasn’t sure if the swab was picking up dust or dirt or if the item actually contained Nikel.  Be aware that if you use this product on yellow gold jewelry which has been converted to white gold by dipping in rhodium,  the color will be removed and you will have a yellow gold spot on your jewelry.  If you were testing on a gold ring, make sure to rub on the inside, not the outside.  I definitely feel this is overpriced for what you get."
2.0,"Okay, I believe this will be an update to a review I posted previously. Although I was pleased with the customer service from Amazon, I am not at all pleased with the quality of product. I understand that you get what you pay for BUT this is not worth $10. The quality belongs in a 99 cent store more than here. Not trying to be harsh, just wanting to provide an honest review. The glasses had initially came in defective, hence the discount  I received but now they have broken from the metal that allows you to &#34;expand&#34; (for lack of a better word) them for wearing. Cheap..cheap..cheap."
2.0,I bought a large and it is too small. Buy it a size bigger.
2.0,Very strong but to hard to put in your shoes. I only was able to put in 2 and when I went to take them out one of them had to be torn out.
2.0,"Very disappointing when reviews lead you to order the wrong size. This dress does NOT run small, if anything it runs large. I am 5’3 123lbs and went with the 4-6 (medium) size based on complaints about it being too tight. I’m inclined to believe those reviewers may not be accurate about their own sizing. I am normally a size 4 in dresses but this dress is huge. The open back gaps a lot, it’s below the knee, huge throughout the mid section. The only plus is the adjustable straps. It’s for a costume so I’ll just attempt to shrink it and, if needs, cut/sew. My advice? Order a size down."
2.0,Not very happy at all I purchased these sun glasses and when they came they were fine but after a month of just regularly folding the frame from open to close the frame started to bend. Not the best pair I have ever bought
2.0,the quality is inferior to the other ugg boots.
2.0,"I absolutely loved these glasses when I had them.  They looked great on, were easy to keep clean.  Unfortunately, after having them for only a few weeks one of the arms snapped off. I tried to repair it to no avail and sadly said a too early goodbye to one of my favorite pairs of sunglasses I've ever owned."
2.0,How can I order the size I need because if its loose it fly's off when I ride it might be ok for people walking around but when I'm on my Harley thing's have a tendency to fly off.
2.0,"These leggings are not reflective in the way they are represented in the seller photos. Ultra reflective material is supposed to GLOW when you take a photo or video with flash. As you can see in my photos, the lines on these leggings look the same, flash or no flash, while my bag that is actually made out the actual reflective material glows like a light under the same conditions.<br /><br />Sizing wise- order two sizes up."
2.0,Top has elastic that is constantly riding up the body exposing the belly.
2.0,They were too pointed for me. I returned them. But I guess that was more my fault since they are called Super Tip Pointed. Maybe a pic of them on a model would've helped.
2.0,"I got the necklace on the deliver date I was excited, but when I opened it the chain was so tangled, and the charm wasn't what i thought it was, The metal is real thin, and so is the necklace"
2.0,These were way too small. They are more child size then womens. There is no way anyone over 10 can wear these up to their mid calf even!
2.0,"cant read it most of the time, too dark."
2.0,"This runs small. I wear a small & it's tight through the shoulders & the sleeves are quite short. So you can't turn back the polka dot sleeve. The material is quite thin, I don't think it would wash well. Returning it."
2.0,Wayyyy tooo small
2.0,Great for like a month then they ripped. I really liked their fit as they made my hands look feminine. Just sadly fell apart.
2.0,I ordered the red and i received a neon pink swimsuit
2.0,"It's a beautiful hat but definitely not 6 3/4 -6 7/8. If you know you have a very small hat size , move along. This is not the hat you're looking for."
2.0,"Love the style but the dress appears to be made for small, flat chested, short women.  I usually wear a medium so , based on other reviews that said it ran small, I ordered a large.  I should have ordered a triple large.  It’s crazy small.  So I returned it."
2.0,"Cute dress, though thin and clingy. Recommend ordering a size up."
2.0,"I wanted to like this skirt.  The fabric is thick satin polyester.  I am 5’5” tall and 115 lbs.  I bought the small.  The sizing guide says the skirt is 39.5” long, but it’s really closer to 37”.  If you are expecting this skirt to be floor length, you will be disappointed.  With heels on you can see my entire shoe and some of my ankle- very weird.  Also, the waist is way too big even though it has elastic.  In the unstretched position it is 27” wide."
2.0,Very pretty.  Just not true to size.  Buy up at least 2 sizes.
2.0,Wore it twice and it broke. Not in a fixable way. One of the main center pieces just cracked in half.
2.0,It ran on the smaller side.  The material was a bit much and it poofed out too much under the waistband with the pleats.  Did not like on me.  Made me appear larger than what I am. The material was cheap feeling.  The colors on the flowers were pretty though.
2.0,"Very nice quality and feel, BUT... they are so big they do not fit inside the helmet . Once the helmet is on you can even put the goggles in your face. These would be great for snowboarding but not for use with a motorcycle helmet."
2.0,I don't care for the material on this shirt. I does look like the picture. I orderd a small thats the size i wear and it fit kinda odd. I would not purchase this again.
2.0,Es muy sencilla la tela muy baja calidad
2.0,I don't know if I didn't have the right size or was doing something wrong but this did not work for me. I ended up getting a refund from Amazon.
2.0,"The package took forever to arrive and the jacket itself is pretty cheap, it got ripped after just 2 days"
2.0,"Quality material, but it won’t stay tight on my waist!"
2.0,but could be better if this item were curved.
2.0,"I purchased this for my mother whom is ... shall we say... ""hugable"".  I bought large on purpose so she would be comfortable lounging in it.  I had to go back and read the product because i don't know which person was considered to be 'LARGE'.... it must have been a toddler.  This is NOT true to size by any means.  The waistband would probably JUST fit me and i'm a 6-8.  I reordered an XL immediately and i'm not confident that is even large enough...i certainly don't want to make my mom feel self conscious and order her an XXXL just to be comfy.  i'll know 12/25th!"
2.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in this top, it seems to be a different fabric than what's shown in their photos.  The fabric is very thin and clingy, it looks like a nightshirt.  I ordered a size up because the size chart made me think it would run a little small but it's huge, so I should have stuck with my usual size.  I would never wear this out of the house, it's very poor quality.  I will sleep in it.  I don't recommend this one."
2.0,"The product description says ""Women's Reversible Leather Belts for Jeans Pants with Rotated Buckle"" which would suggest that there are two belts as shown in the picture but only one belt was received."
2.0,I really like the style of this bra and it is effective but it pokes and itches at the strap seams and the straps themselves tend to dig in.  I'm pink with irritation in several places when I take it off.
2.0,Disappointing the waist was tight ...
2.0,Looks and feels great but the rubber trim peeled of after 2 months and show stitching
2.0,"These do not stick, they are thick, heavy, and VERY noticeable under clothing. These would only work under an already structured top."
2.0,Disappointed the picture of them made them look a lot thicker.  Found to be very thin in make😞. They were going to be a Xmas gift not sure if I want them to have now
2.0,"The dress feels very cheap. Also, it is very wide at the top."
2.0,"very disappointed!  the navy is a dull navy, and the navy lace doesn't match the shirt. Very disappointed!"
2.0,"There are several issues: the fingers are too long, the wrists too tight, and they aren’t at all supple and soft but stiff like plastic. Worst of all, however, is that they have a strong odor of mold or chemicals.  I will have to return them."
2.0,"Looks just like the picture but does not fit well like it’s a shirt for little girls, it also came later than what it said, I don’t recommend this shirt at all can’t even add a picture because it goes over my breast and barely on my arm"
2.0,"Very disappointed with this dress. The purple color of the top doesn't match the flowers at all. Do not buy if you have a larger bust, it will lift the dress up."
2.0,Did not like the material and it was too short.  It was nothing like the picture.
2.0,I am a size 24 and the 3x did not fit at all. The material was not as expected either
2.0,Couldn’t use necklace as it was too short. Pretty but of no use to me.
2.0,"Im a 38DD up top, with a small waist. So I ordered a medium. I really love the dress and the way it hugs my curves but they really need to work on the bust area. It's way to small. I see no purpose for the belt. On some pictures the belt was attached and others it wasn't, but mine wasn't. I won't be purchasing from the seller again. I will be giving this dress to someone else."
2.0,"The designs, material, and feel were great! But how  am I suppose to wear a mask that has no nose support and/or stretchy material to fit my face. I dont have a small head either...lol. I tried a few on and they all had a different fit, but all continued to fall off my nose eveytime I moved my face or talked. These would be PERFECT if you added a flexible nose support. Returned 😔."
2.0,Did not fit well too big
2.0,Not what you’d expect
2.0,after washing in delicate once shrunk<br />Unable to wear anymore
2.0,They were nice at first and they already broke.
2.0,"I used to be a huge fan of Sarah’s Silks. I’m 2019 I bought 6 colors of these silks. My boys play with these silks constantly. They get a lot of use and love. We recently lost one color and needed to replace it, the silk I was sent is not of the same quality as the original silks. First off, it has numerous loose or looped threads all along the seams, which snag easily. Also, they’ve added a bulky tag to the edge! It’s horrible. It definitely interferes with the ability of the silk to flutter and flow in the breeze, be used in experiments, etc. It’s attached in such a way you’ll destroy the edge by removing the entire tag. Huge turn off. Furthermore, this newer silk feels almost fake! It’s noticeably different and it must use less material because when wadded up it’s much smaller than the older silks. They’ve definitely gone the cheap route in order to increase profits. Very sad. This will be the last silk I purchase."
2.0,My great grandson is 6 months wear between a 9 to 12 month and they do not fit him once washed in cold water. I would not buy these again.
2.0,No me gusto !!! Nada que ver a la foto
2.0,Brick red color is actually two tones of bright orange.
2.0,"My daughter loved this & wanted to put it on right away. I was happy that is was comfortable for her (she’s 5t, I ordered 6-7 size) I ordered a size up which I recommend. The material is a little thinner than I thought & the skirt is not as full as I hoped. However, she’s worn it a few times, it’s been washed (no dryer) a few times & it’s still in good condition. UPDATE  3 months later, the silver dots on the skirt are faded and the little jewel on the belt area fell off, definitely looks worn out now."
2.0,We bought this for our glasses while ice fishing.  There were times when our glasses still fogged and then frosted  up and it was within a couple of hours of application.
2.0,They are smaller than expected. Having trouble opening them. That's a good thing because when I do get them open I won't have to worry about them opening back up
2.0,"I ordered this watch after reading mixed reviews. First impression was - cool looking watch but just like other reviewers indicated the band is junk. But I wore it anyway because I like the look. But within a few weeks I realized that the analog time was losing time even though the digital time was correct. It lost time every day. Not sure if it is a result f the battery of the gears. I filed a complaint through Amazon and they told me that because it was a direct purchase they did not warranty the item. However, Amazon did relay the information to the manufacturer who followed up telling me that they would replace the item. I received confirmation that a replacement has shipped but have not yet seen it. Hopefully the new one will work correctly, I expect it will."
2.0,look cute but can't be left in for too long or worn in the shower
2.0,"Soft socks, but they wear out after one wash. No joke, the bottom was see through. But I have to say they were cosy, fir the 3 hours I wore them. Not warm very thin. They lose all the soft material inside, the sock. I had globs of tint all over my feet."
2.0,Quality is subpar and fit is not good
2.0,Polyester and I don't like the way up looks totally different on the picture
2.0,"Not for big busted women..shame too because it fits nice, nice material except the breast area. Cheap, flimsy, no support and the cups are lose and fold up inside the top. They are not sewn into the lining and they are thin and flimsy"
2.0,Came with a hole in the front but it was fine for the costume party
2.0,The picture does not look correct compared to the actual dress. The upper lace looks of a very different and very poor quality considering the price of the dress. We had to send it for repair to remove the lace.<br />It fit a little bit large but we where expecting that.
2.0,"Thick fabric, not breathable and weird fit. Not a fan. Also, not for longer arms or medium sized arms either."
2.0,My had came with ears apparently
2.0,"Zreey Men's Underwear Soft Cotton Boxer Briefs Men<br /><br />The underwear feels good but the quality is ok, soft material, the reason for 2 stars is the packaging, not sure from amazon or from manufacture. when i open the package the underwear already opened and scatter all over the box, and only 3 underwear left. this is the 1st time that i get shipment this bad from amazon. ok product but the shipment is BAD!!"
2.0,"This fanny pack is much smaller than I thought it would<br />be according to the online description. I'll have to pay<br />shipping and a restock fee if I return it, so I'll keep it<br />and hope I'll use it sometime in the future.<br />So, I don't recommend this fanny pack if you need one with<br />lots of room."
2.0,"Pretty gown but not the blue in the picture at all, almost purple. Very soft. Runs about 2 sizes too small though. I'm very disappointed. Wanted to wear it to lay around with my fiancé in for my birthday on Sunday but that won't be happening. I will not be purchasing another. Waste of money."
2.0,I had purchased a set of 4 from a local store for $1.50. Those lasted a really long time. Thought these at Amazon would be a great purchase too! Disappointed: Around 7-8 did not even light up! The remaining did not last too long. Would not buy these again from here!
2.0,Gave it away to little girl.
2.0,It looks better in the picture. Not as good when wearing it.
2.0,This product was not a very good supported shoe at all when walking.
2.0,Although it said it was an adult size it was more like a young child size.
2.0,stiff thick fabric<br />this print is more like chamo<br />you have to tie the back and scrunch the material around the neck line.<br />did not like it.  pictures need to be more representative of how the top fastens
2.0,top too small
2.0,Great concept but I should have read the size better. My insulated drink carrier doesn't fit.
2.0,Nice look but very fragile threading. I don't recommend this. The threads snapped after wearing this for about 2 weeks. I did take it off at night. I think just from putting jackets and sweatshirts on exposed its weak points too much. Put too much stress on it. Be gentle if purchasing
2.0,Not corduroy and not burgundy. It is a Christmas red and cotton. I see now in the details it doesn’t say corduroy so that is my bad. I’m going to try and dye it since it was expensive. Kinda pissed.
2.0,"This helmet is okay, but if it's a little too big for your head, as it is for mine, then it just sort of flops around on your head and your eyes won't align with the eyeholes.  Also, it has a permanent crease on the top, which resulted from its being stored and shipped folded up.  So it is not round on the top, but instead has a slight ridge.  If you're looking for an authentic-looking helmet that fits and looks good, you might need to look into custom options."
2.0,Too small for it's intended purpose.
2.0,It's pretty but I ordered it rose gold and I've only wore it for two days and it's turning brown and green. Very cheap.
2.0,The butt gets kind of see through after a while
2.0,Kinda big to be a wallet. It should have the straps on both sides as well. It’ll have to do for now until I find something else.
2.0,"While I do believe these are true Lapis, they are color enhanced with dye. They dye my earlobes blue every time I wear them. I’m sure this will wear off after a while, but it’s pretty annoying for the time being."
2.0,"Looks and feels very, very cheap."
2.0,"I initially liked this wallet, that is until it broke after about a month. Disappointed"
2.0,maybe i just have a bigger head but these didnt really fit me so i was dissapointed with the product
2.0,"I used M , but this size in this brand is more and XS.  The web description is incorrect. I remove the tags before i try it so cannot  return it."
2.0,I ordered the Red to wear to a Christmas party and I’m really disappointed with the color. It’s much more of a Coral color and not bright red like the photo. I’ll be finding another option.
2.0,"The picture is very misleading. The skirt looks almost twice as long in the picture, than it actually is."
2.0,strap on bag is already broken after one month of use.  makes it extremely difficult to use.
2.0,Not a fan. This was super cute in the pictures but the sleeves were huge on my arms and the cut was strange. I thought I must have gotten this from Wish until I saw this on my old amazon order list. Wish I’d tried to get a refund.
2.0,"I was disappointed in this item.  It was made out of cheap materials, so much so that an inch of the necklace was already tarnished.  The marble  was so tiny that I couldn’t see it if I stepped three feet away from my reflection.  I’m returning this item."
2.0,Was to big for my steering wheel. I have a Toyota Corolla 2013.
2.0,"The skirt part wasn't bad - it fit pretty well, but the top portion was terrible quality fabric and very baggy, poor fit. The coloring was very off, too. orange/ywellow/brown instead of pink/red/yellow"
2.0,These were purchased for my girlfriend (at her request). While they look OK she had some issues with swelling/redness while wearing these. In the end she removed it and went with a little higher quality stud.
2.0,"I like the style and the fabric of this top, but the color doesn’t match at all. I ordered the pink and the top I got is a bright coral. I will be returning it."
2.0,"I bought this to wear around the house, but it is so hot that I can't wear it at all.  The fabric traps in the heat.  It is pretty though."
2.0,Extremely cheaply made. The gem in it is sort of glued into the pendant. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"I would have to agree with the other reviewers, this charm does not look like the picture. the quality is not what I expected. I would rather have bought the other strawberry charm I saw from chamilla."
2.0,No flexibility at all. Might as well apply color with a stick.
2.0,"I like the idea behind it, but they really look cheap. They're OK for kids to wear, but grown women wouldn't want to. Should be about $5 or $6."
2.0,"I bought these for my husband. They have a great design, but are so thin and almost see through in some places. I would not buy these again for that reason."
2.0,This shirt does not have any kind of shape. It is an oversized t -shirt you could buy at Walmart in multi packs with a design on it. If that is what you are looking for is great otherwise skip this one.
2.0,I ordered 2 sizes up based on reviews.  I ordered MAXI 3/4 length/ navy.  I am 5'6&#34; and it was 6-8 inches short.  Looked awkward. Had to return.  The dress does fall nicely.  The elastic waist band hit me higher than the model.  Really needs to be worn with belt if going out of house with it to hide the elastic.
2.0,This is for a huge child. Not for a small child at all
2.0,"I was really Excited to get this in the mail but after waiting a couple weeks I was very disappointed that it was probably a large for a kid, I wouldn’t even say It was a large for a teenager"
2.0,This shirt does not fit true to size!!!
2.0,Wig was terrible
2.0,"This is a nice quality and color, I love the canvas fabric on the exterior and the quilted inside of the mask. However, be careful wearing them or rubbing against lighter colored clothes as I washed mine and left it on a white towel to dry and the dye began crocking (she was coming off)."
2.0,"The cross is red (not black), which makes it look more Nazi that I'm ok with. I had to repaint it. The band itself is great, very soft, has a nice weight, and three separate sizes for wrists."
2.0,Weird material. Wider than expected but length is good
2.0,Runs very small & fabric is not good quality. I ended up returning it.
2.0,"It was a struggle to even get this over my head (and I have a small head, shoulders and back). My guess is that they make it compression to suck you in, but I found it way too uncomfortable. Would rather get the compression from high waisted leggings and let the top breathe a bit."
2.0,Broke after 2 times wearing it.
2.0,Material was not soft and looked cheap.  Product delivered was not like one ordered.  Out sourced so return was futile
2.0,The quality of the material is nice. The size of the shirt.....not so much. Buy a size up.
2.0,Bottom small and top big
2.0,[[VIDEOID:dc5bf861727acb019a3bb55ff6eb3fdd]] I received my order today and only got the pink and grey pair. They feel comfortable but disappointing the black pair is missing from the package.
2.0,Chain broke in less than three months. It was cute and dainty though.
2.0,The skirt is very very large and long.  Almost 5 inches puddles on the floor.
2.0,Good quality for the money. This shirt is just way too small so if you are medium you will need a large or xlarge and so forth.
2.0,Turned quick.
2.0,Stiff and heavy.
2.0,This top was clingy and unflattering for me. It went back. No obvious defects though.
2.0,"Like them , thank you!"
2.0,Uncomfortable. Doesn't fit well.
2.0,The sizing is not correct and there is no support.
2.0,Pocket are ridiculously high. Sent it back. It fit fine so I was disappointed.
2.0,poor quality..don't bother
2.0,"The light blue in size XS is definitely not a small. I think the fabric was weird too. I ordered this color and the burgundy, and the burgundy had pockets. Not great quality."
2.0,Very small keepers falling out.
2.0,It fits big and the quality is not great
2.0,"I love this dress, but in just two months, it has a hole in it and is pilling badly."
2.0,Mala calidad y el tiempo de envío fue de casi semana y media
2.0,The jacket is a 2x perfect...<br />The pants are toooo short.
2.0,They are ok. Not as well made others I have. The plastic is thinner and rest on my face a little crooked causing my regular glasses to push on my eye lashes.
2.0,"Really cheap looking. I didn't even take it out of the plastic packaging, and I returned it the day I got it. Buckle looks like plastic."
2.0,It was too tight and too low cut also different than the round neck.
2.0,"The tie is very nice quality, but the color is much darker than pictured. I was wanting a medium gray and this is almost black but not black enough so it clashes with a black suit."
2.0,Very basic watch. Seems imported. Quartz movement. Lum isn't as up to other Seiko quality. The band is low quality. The manual seems like a copy.  This is at best a gray market watch. Buy it if you must have a basic dressy watch.
2.0,Product is cheaply made and poorly fitted. I am below average height yet these are above ankle length and are not fitted to my ankles like other joggers.
2.0,I hate the material .. super cheap
2.0,The material was very thin making the ski hat unfit to wear in cold weather. It was also very tight and uncomfortable.
2.0,They are much smaller than you show also they are NOT stamped 14k and they are very hard to put in your ear because they want to bend and are very thin it took me over 15 minutes to get one earring on also I measured them and they are smaller than you say they are. and when you have them on you can't even see them there so thin
2.0,You get what you pay for...band had to be glued then time keeping issue even after a new battery. Love the look but disappointed overall.
2.0,"Uncomfortable and ran small, but the little sequins were cute. I couldn’t get the chain on the back to lay flat either"
2.0,I like it but it’s like a pj material. The shiny stuff
2.0,Didn’t like the cheap fabric and the letters were all rolled up instead of laying flat. Looks like the will peel off with ease and washing.
2.0,Why on advertising the underwear is triangle but was sent the grandma underwear
2.0,"I thought that they would send something that described not only the policy,but also a description of what item was covered and the expiration date for my files."
2.0,I was hoping these would work with my pumps but you can see the tops.  They are simply too long for my purpose but I'm sure they would work great with shoes which aren't cut close to the toes.
2.0,Fit no where close to what was advertised
2.0,"so these rings are cute and all.....but it’s been stuck in my nose for a couple weeks now. very hard to open. haven’t figured out how to yet, even used a lot of force. help lol"
2.0,cheapo jewelry
2.0,"This band appears to be well made.  I have no problem using the clasp, which seems to be secure.  The housing for the fitbit seems secure, as well.  But it is UGLY!  It may be stainless steel, but it looks like cheap plastic.  I guess I may use it from time to time, but  did I mention, it is UGLY!"
2.0,I wrote a review on this and it disappeared. Interesting. It's a beautiful necklace just like pictured but it came in the mail in 2 pieces. I thought it was broken at first but realized it was missing the hook that attached the 2 parts. I managed to fix it but it fell apart again after wearing it the first time. Also the closure on the back is incredibly hard to close around your neck.
2.0,The strings do not stay tight abs causes the band to loosen all day when worn. Disappointed Witt its purchase.
2.0,The Large fits like an XL. Fits very flimsy and after 1 wash it got looser.
2.0,"Definitely is not accurate in sizing. I gave it to my little sister who is expecting. The 2T is more like a 9m or 12m. The suit itself is adorable, which earned it two stars instead of one."
2.0,Was missing the hook to connect the clasp. Didnt return. Just wasnt worth the time.
2.0,"They’re beautiful, but the little bulb at the end is so small they don’t stay in."
2.0,The slippers run smaller than you would expect.
2.0,"I ordered what I thought was for my 32 waist, but it was more like a 34 with an inseam of 34. I don't know if sizes are consistent with this brand but it was disappointing to say the least.<br /><br />I will return and not consider this brand any more.<br /><br />Thanks."
2.0,"This mask is only on the front of your face.  That may sound like a good thing but if any pressure is applied to the sides of the mask the entire mask shifts on your face, ramming the mask directly into your nose.<br /><br />The pads below the eyes block all vision as they are thick (which provides nice padding against hits from the front) and not clear.<br /><br />I barely felt safe walking around the house with this mask on, let alone getting onto the soccer field.  I wouldn't be able to see to kick a stationary ball let alone one that was moving."
2.0,I liked the cut (although it is definitely a thong cut!). But the white fabric was much too sheer. You can see everything!
2.0,I ordered an XL and it was shorter than it was in the picture because of my chest/bust. I didn't like how it fit me. It more or so fit like a bra than a t-shirt.
2.0,Was very loose and odd fitting.
2.0,"The shirt itself is fine, but it's way too small. I normally wear a large which is what I bought. I felt like I was trying to put on a child's shirt."
2.0,"Fits ok but not a lot of support, plus after a few wears the wires pop out of the suit."
2.0,Looks good but too small.....
2.0,I ordered this top looking for an oatmeal colored top and it came in more butter colored
2.0,"This beautiful, high quality scarf will be used as next year's Christmas presents for two dear relatives. I am extremely pleased. I would love to have ordered more than two. However, this was all that was available. I would like to order other prints/colors if available."
2.0,I need to return this dress<br />is to tie
2.0,"Wonderful customer service!! Seller goes above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.  The shirt is beautiful, size suggestion: order a size down to ensure ur fit is right!! Otherwise, wonderful purchase!!"
2.0,Doesn’t cover my chin and keeps slipping up.
2.0,It’s flimsy. When Unclipped to use the pads get smushed and rolls so you have to reposition the pads also The pads tend to rise as you wear the bra. It’s okay for a lounger bra.
2.0,I wear a 3x shirt but this bathing suit was huge! Definitely cute though. Would order definitely a size or two smaller.
2.0,The band looks good but that's about where it ends for me. They are slightly too wide to fit into the connector ends that attach to the watch. This causes it to bunch up inside the metal connector piece and it just looks like the least amount of time spent was utilized to make these look good. Second is where it is stitched rubs on your wrist and is annoying. These simple oversights in my opinion made a band that should have been great into a band that's so so.
2.0,"I hope this helps someone thinking about purchasing.  The design of this piece is unique; the pearls are strung on what I would call ""fishing line"" and it doesn't exactly lay flat.  The reason I took off  two stars is that the clasp is broken, it didn't include a short chain to adjust the length, and it was crumpled up (&shipped) in a small1.5 inch plastic pouch. Needless to say, it took quite a while to untangle the necklace.  My advise is to spend more and get a better quality item.  Hope this helps someone thinking about purchasing this item."
2.0,"NOT a beautiful ring. It's okay but not at all what I expected or wanted which was a delicate, nice ring to wear alongside other rings."
2.0,"The cut of this dress is not as pictured.  Perhaps, when the sizes go up, their proportions are not adjusted appropriately.  Did not look like the description/picture."
2.0,"I has such high hopes for these! The product arrived promptly on time, that's pretty much the only reason for the two stars. I expected to see some scratches on the subway token, based on previous reviews, and on the product picture, however, when I opened the presentation box, the cufflinks were scratched so much, that it distracted from the design. Besides the scratches, there were a few tarnished black spots on the T side of the token, which were very noticeable! The setting of the cufflinks was tarnished as well.. with grey/black splotches. Maybe the pair I got just happened to have been sitting in the warehouse for a few years, but I'm pretty sure the product was not inspected prior to shipment. I am returning the cufflinks. I am going to order another pair to see if I get a better set, but I'm not holding my breath."
2.0,The chain broke very easily. I wore it three times.i hope I am able to fix it--I like the style.
2.0,They broke after two weeks that is so not okay.
2.0,"These are probably more ""teen"" sizes than women's, so keep that in mind. The length is definitely way shorter - I ended up with a crop top. They are also more transparent than you'd expect. You will definitely want a tank or something underneath if there is white around the chest of your chosen style. The fabric is nice sweater/knit material but will need to be managed - I probably won't wash it a whole lot and will likely air dry flat so it doesn't get out of shape.  I am 5'8"" 155lbs and got a standard Medium originally. I had to return and sized up by two sizes, so hopefully that will do the trick."
2.0,"I normally get a medium or large in tops, but I like hoodies to fit bigger, so I went with large on this.  I have carried heavy stacks of books around for 23 years, as a profession, and my arms show that, and the sleeves on this are so narrow, I could barely get my arms in, they were uncomfortably tight. The shoulders and chest are a little narrow, as well (in the interest of helpful size info, I'm 5'3 and wear a 36 D), so it's not the roomy, flowy fit I was wanting.  The material is not soft, cottony material you normally get in a hoodie or tee, but it might be a little less stiff, once it's washed.  If I was going to exchange, I'd probably go with a 2X.  Long story short, unless you want it to fit tightly, upsize."
2.0,"I’ve been using Speidel bands for years, but this band just feels like a cheap knockoff. It is extremely lightweight and feels flimsy. Adjusting the band length was an absolute nightmare compared to other Speidel bands. I’d consider looking elsewhere."
2.0,"Made cheaply. First time I tried to insert the &#34;base&#34; into my wallet it tore from the photo sleeves. I have used this type of insert for years, including purchases from amazon,this is the first time this has happened."
2.0,shipped faster than expected. But very small fit.
2.0,"Pilled up very quickly. Also, makes me sneeze!"
2.0,"The style itself is pretty nice.  I have a short torso, so I never expect things to fit great from the waist up, but this dress wasn’t too bad.  The V is a little low, and the inner face of the V might need to be periodically tucked back in.  The side zip looks nice but felt a little cheap.  I thought the dress from the waist down was very flattering—a nice length, and not skintight around the midsection area.  I’m about 38-30-42 and the L fit well enough.  I don’t think M would have been better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the reason I’m going to return this is the fabric.  It is awful, awful fabric.  The print is cute, but that’s all it has going for it.  It’s thin and feels like a cheap Halloween costume.  It also wrinkles incredibly easily.  I can’t imagine wearing this to work or out somewhere where I’d be sitting for long periods of time because it would just be disgustingly wrinkled in the back by the time I stood up.  I can’t even imagine what it’s like if you wash it.<br /><br />So if you’re looking for something kind of retro to wear for a party or event, this is probably a good buy.  As a pretty dress to become a staple in your wardrobe, not so much."
2.0,"These fingers are kinda too small. The nail is narrow and the edge is rough if you wanted to practice applying acrylic/false nails these wouldn't be the fingers to do it with. However if you wanted to just practice doing manicures or simple nail art since the nails on these finger have length, it would be good for that. They are sturdy enough to work on, but again the finger/nail is rather small. I guess they are okay. The angle of the finger was nice for drawing; I was able to do some pretty cute designs on them. Though the clean up was a little bothersome since there is a gap between the nail outline and the cuticle and the edges are kind of jagged and the seam for the plastic is in the middle of the nail. If you are one of those people who decide on buying a product by price vs. quality. These weren't a bad buy for the price. Eh."
2.0,"I expected it to be longer and a lower v on the neck, as the photo suggests. It is much smaller, and the length is not what is suggested."
2.0,"This ""dress"" turned into a tshirt after being washed."
2.0,"If you're into wearing giant t-shirts out, this is for you."
2.0,"I wear a between a medium-large. I ordered an xl and Im shocked at how small this dress is. Im used to ordering a size up on online orders, an xl should fit like a US 10-12 this fits like a US 6-8 at an XL in the chest area. Im not even that large chested. I wear a 36 C and I could not fit this over my chest. Such a bummer because this dress is honestly beautiful. Totally sheer but with a slip and a bralette this could be a total vibe. Fits everywhere but the chest. But plan to order at least 2 sizes up and you still might need to send it back"
2.0,"It is cut box like, will just wear around the house, not as pictured"
2.0,Runs  small and the V neck is low
2.0,"Pro: My daughter seems to like these and she’s picky when it comes to textures so they must be comfy.<br />Con: She’s only worn one pair so far, and I noticed there was already a significant hole in the crotch area the 2nd time she wore them."
2.0,My son loves the shirt. Unfortunately the shark decal has started to peel off after only to washes.
2.0,"Quality, not so much. Sweater looks like it is tearing at the top of the slit. It runs huge."
2.0,"Cheaply made ,way small"
2.0,Doesn't fit small head well.
2.0,"The size wasn't right. If buying this product, please buy one size up."
2.0,"The crown was too little, and, the scepter broke almost immediately. Dang. My grandson like it though. Didn’t last long…😕"
2.0,This hat has a very strange shape. You'd need a head like a watermelon for it to fit. It was nice quality but far too deep for it to sit right.
2.0,"Some are very pretty and I love them, some I can not use due to the stamps being backwards on the charms... check the charms before using them."
2.0,"Great customer service, but cheap material."
2.0,"Loved it, but too large and no XXS.  If it fit, I’d give it 5.  It’s a diagonal pattern that’s very slimming."
2.0,See through and terrible quality. Returned
2.0,Small. Fabric is thin and is not the greatest of quality but the shirt was inexpensive. I won't wear it.
2.0,Too small! Had to give to my 13 year old daughter because they were so tiny. Very disappointed
2.0,I really wanted to wear these when I received them but unfortunately both of the earrings arrived damaged. The piercing ends were broken and the cuffs were bent due to very poor packaging. So disappointed.
2.0,Broke after first 30 min
2.0,"For the price not so great the material is horrible see-through and I have tried to buy several dresses from different companies on Amazon and sadly Ross, target, Walmart, Costco has better quality and is way cheaper"
2.0,Sizing was a bit off but the design is good. Could potentially give a better fit with higher quality fabric. Returned but Amazon has not refunded me.
2.0,The watch works.  It's cute.  But the surface of the flower is super scratched up like it's been worn or banging up against something.  The watch face has no damage though.  I'll use it.  Returning it wouldn't be worth the effort.
2.0,Wasnt even the same color as one pictured. The seller also makes returning items difficult in a blatant attempt to discourage returns. First and a last for me.
2.0,"Based on other reviewers, I ordered 2 sizes up thinking it would be okay to have it a little loose.  It fit perfectly, however just barely covered my arse.  What the h@ll is this?  I cannot say I'm tall, I'm 5'5&#34;. I'm quite realistic about my size and don't pretend to fit in something I know I won't.  So I'm baffled by this...whatever it is.  So very very disappointed in this.  returning."
2.0,"The product fit fine; however, there was a small hole that resulted in a run in the fabric when I tried the leggings on. They had to be thrown away."
2.0,Did not like the quality material.
2.0,I really wanted to like this but it would only look good on a two years old child. The coin is the size of a two penny and if you are a grown man with a large neck it will never fit on you.<br />I haven't returned it because I love Stephen King's Dark Tower and I just can't give it away (it's my precioussssssss). But if I could go back I would never buy it again.
2.0,This shirt looks really cute on the model online.  But it looks completely different than what you actually receive.  It's much shorter in the front than it is in the back and it's VERY sheer.  The overall fit was as I expected.  I'm returning this item.
2.0,"These boots are really cute and the style I was searching for. I'd read on the Keen website that they run small and to order a 1/2 size up. I did so. I'm a 6.5 across the board with all my shoes pretty much no matter the brand, and I own like 5 other pairs of keens which are nice and roomy even without being ""wide width""( which I'm am in almost every other brand) but even going up to a 7, I was hard pressed to get my foot into the boot with thin socks. They are stiff and pretty narrow considering all my other Keens. I have no idea who designed this boot, but they need to try try again. Unless you have very long narrow feet, these were awful for the 20 seconds they were on. I'm sad."
2.0,Really cute design but the fit was WAY too big. Had to send it back.
2.0,"Not my taste, were flatter than they appear in the photo"
2.0,Almost impossible to put the stem into the wood when it's in your ear.  You will need assistance
2.0,"Not as cute as on the model.  It was see through. I ordered the white and blue outfit. The front was coming apart,  unseamed"
2.0,"I got these UPS and sent them back the same day. They are huge!!! I bought them in my size and I swear it was crossed over to a men size, so double or triple the size needed. I loved the way they looked. But of coarse I'm not going to play the juggle game of finding what size I really need."
2.0,"The images displayed shows sort of a metallic finish to the rings. However, they are a dull cheap quality and the details on the red ring looks like fish scales."
2.0,"The photo says it all. Beautiful piece, just the way I wanted it to be. The little pearls were off when I first opened the package. I will try to fix it myself, but I doubt I can save the pearls if I lose them while wearing it ."
2.0,I purchased this item for my boyfriend as a gift. A friend of ours had recommended it! The wallet is a very nice wallet my only criticism would be there are not enough card slots. He had to remove things he uses and decide which cards were most important to have. Other than that FANTASTIC buy!<br /><br />Update:<br />Was a wonderful wallet for a short period of time after 3 months the wallet inserts broke. My boyfriend had to just place the cards in the wallet and hope nothing would fall out each time he opened it. The clip then broke a couple of weeks later. This is not a durrable wallet. If you are looking for a long time use wallet this is not for you!
2.0,This dress took forever to arrive.  And once it did I was disappointed to find that it is just ok.  The top makes me look huge in the busy - which isn’t a problem BUT it also excentuates my belly area making me look pregnant.  Not a favorite dress by any means.
2.0,Ok for a baby that doesn’t walk. Fits weird pushes the foot all the way to the front.
2.0,Started out ok but by the end of the day the backs of my heels were in so much pain from the hard plastic rubbing against them. I'll try to put some kind of padding on the inside of the heel to make them wearable.
2.0,Material was not as pictured and feels low quality. Sizing chart needs to be made more accurate.
2.0,The shorts fit perfect but it did not come with the belt like it shows on the picture and there was no hope for the button so therefore I give this two stars at least they fit that's one good thing I needed a size 2 and I ordered the extra large.. and it fit perfectly..
2.0,These bands easily get stained and I can’t remove it even if I clean it.
2.0,First one arrived with a dead battery- still waiting for ups to pick- up.
2.0,"The Hanes boxer briefs I've purchased before I liked, theses don't fit as well and I'm not happy with these."
2.0,I love the material to the shorts but the waist is small and got a larger size and it’s still tight and I’m typically the first size I ordered… but if I go larger the length will be too long. Unfortunately it’s not for me but the material is great.
2.0,Pulls threads too easily.
2.0,"It is advertised as having sequins, there are no sequins on the dress,  and and it has an almost foam feel to the dress.  Very cheap feeling,  and not at all what was advertised,  and does not look at all like the picture.  When it arrived,  I wasn't even sure it was the same dress.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"In the picture, the sweatshirt shows as a 'fitted' fit.  However, when the item arrived, it was very boxy and mis-shapen.  I would have sent it back because I think that it looks very sloppy.  My daughter, however, loved it because it said McCall on it - and wanted to keep it.  Since it was a christmas gift - I let her - but I wouldn't recommend this sloppy fitting product."
2.0,Sized too small. The pants fit perfect bit the top is too small
2.0,It was too big for me (size S) so Im probably going to return
2.0,"Color is what I expected<br />Didn't like the material .<br />I expected Grace Karin to be delivered, I thought that's what I ordered ."
2.0,I like to say the metal  turned black. I was very excited for this item because I got it in memory of my daughter who died when she was months and two days old in my arms at Boston childern hospital but when the necklace pendants turned black I was very unhappy  thank you for asking me about this item. Things happened for a reason sincerely yours  Karen
2.0,"It was fine, but not as great as I thought it would be from the picture. Additionally, the belt would not stay fastened. I ended up having to tie it to get it to stay on!"
2.0,Size wasn't as described. I'm a body piercer and these you can't fit on most people for a Monroe piercing etc. I ended up using them when I pierced my daughter ears 2nd holes up. Looks nice there.
2.0,While the socks are advertised as loose fitting the problem is the foot part doesn't stay in place and keeps twisting around the foot.
2.0,I ordered heathered black..... Not Black with sparkles.
2.0,I ordered size 9-11 for a child turning 8. She is slightly tall but pretty slim. I expected a medium or large shirt but received a small shirt. There was no size chart or anything helpful in the description. Now I have to return that shirt and re-order in a larger size and hope I guessed right.  The shirt itself seems ok. It’s that silky lightweight exercise shirt material - the sweat wicking kind. For $8.88 with free prime shipping and free returns I am willing to try again but it was for a birthday gift and now the replacement is set to arrive the day after the party. Luckily it’s not the only gift.
2.0,Too small and sort of cheaply made
2.0,"I was either sent the wrong size or the size chart is inaccurate. I normally wear an XL and the measurements on the size chart were mine, but the sleeves were too tight and even without a bra on the shirt and jacket wouldn’t fit across my chest."
2.0,"I was supposed to receive 50, only got 34.5. One of them was broken. Disappointed was hoping for all 50, going to return. Gave 2 stars because they are cute but that’s it. Didn’t get all of what I paid for."
2.0,"Quality and color is great... However, looks nothing like the picture advertised. The dress goes all the way down to my ankles... And there is no sexy dipped v-neck line. What is this? Returning.<br /><br />I'm a size 14 in regular clothing and ordered an XL. It fit nicely."
2.0,"Works great for a WITCH dress which is the only thing I could get away with wearing it for. Otherwise, it's not attractive, and by flowy they mean it flares out and makes you look fat when your not. *face-palm*"
2.0,Pants were big but shirt was too small.
2.0,Dislike the wide bottoms.  The photo shows a much more tailored bottom fit.
2.0,"Their clip is a little diffucult to attach, end clips are better"
2.0,I ordered a small and it was still too big!
2.0,Looks good but there are certain areas where it looks like it's rusting or paint is peeling off.
2.0,"I took this on and off so many times trying to get it to work that the adhesive was already starting to dull. I got it in one spot that wasn't TERRIBLE but wasn't great, every other way I put it on just made my boobs look weird. Definitely didn't add much of anything so I immediately put it back in the packaging and returned it."
2.0,The size was perfect except for one of the shirts was a size 8 (way to small) and I have no time to return before the holiday. So I guess I got a 2 piece set instead of 3.
2.0,More of a Halloween costume than a warm hat.
2.0,definitely not for a wedding.
2.0,Look...I’m a 34DD this does not hold up the girls. The fit is odd and material is thin. I likely will not wear this. Low quality.
2.0,"Way to small, not sized correctly. I ordered a 38C & it was so small it could fit a 32B . I liked the idea of it but just wasn't the right size . Still was great quality & shipped fast. Just keep in mind the sizes !"
2.0,My son who is in fourth grade use this for about three months and the screws came out of the handle did not hold up well. The  zipper of the backpack is misaligned does not zip well .
2.0,The bad is really stiff and the strap fell out twice. I'm glad saw it fall or I might have lost my watch. I would not recommend this strap
2.0,Cute but fit a little odd
2.0,Product is lightweight but feels very cheap. I wear a size 33 waist and ordered a 34 and I cannot even button them they are tiny!
2.0,Not happy. It broke on me.
2.0,Did not fit according to scale size
2.0,Very thin straps and leather
2.0,The description says “women” button down. It should have said petite woman.<br />I did order an XL but it is too small.<br />I do like the feel of it.
2.0,It’s pretty but broke easily within less than a week of wearing it. Very disappointing as it is pretty.
2.0,Could of been tighter in the waist
2.0,Decent cardigan. I found a big hole in the sleeve only the second time I wore it. Sleeves are way too short and I have kinda short arms. But I keep wearing it because I just wanted something to wear over a nice tank for work
2.0,Did not like the look of the material once 8 had it on. Was super cute in pictures and in the package.
2.0,"2 sizes to small. Purchased 3xl fits like an xl, disappointed because suit is very cute"
2.0,"The bra fits weird, it is loose on top and has lots of upperside boob but has a very tight band. I’m 5”6’ and 130lbs so I got a medium even though i can be a small sometimes, but the bra makes it feel difficult to breath because it’s not very stretchy like a normal sports bra. It’s not awful but I wish I would have spent my money on a different sports bra!"
2.0,Of lesser quality than most clothes
2.0,"The lining of hood is smaller than outside, which couldn’t cover head. Coat is too shot for wearing in cold days."
2.0,I was very disappointed as the prong in the back (the threader) is way to long...<br /> does not look good!!
2.0,"Look and feel like an idiot in this, terrible build and it's basically paper it's so thin, would not recommend"
2.0,Fit is smaller than normal. Will be asking for a refund.
2.0,"It looked good but the medium was really big for me. Also, they packed it in a small box and it was wrinkled."
2.0,I have like four of those but as soon as I ordered the white one it was too small for some reason so I had to return it
2.0,The shirt was way too tight and pants way too long and big. Not as cute as the model wearing it. The material also feels very uncomfortable especially<br />if you have sensitive skin. Considered keeping the top but the pants made me look like a sad marshmallow woman.
2.0,Didn't like how the lettering was done kinda cheap. Put in the Goodwill bag.
2.0,I ordered 2.0 but ended up needing 2.5 strength. The lenses seemed smaller than pictured & bent slightly inward at an angle which distorted the view. They weren't very flattering on so I returned them.
2.0,I’m 5’8 135lb and was very uncomfortable -tight in a large. I’m not sure an extra large would feel much better.
2.0,They ripped in the crotch as soon as I put them on. Nice materiel but horrible quality.
2.0,They fit like a 2 year old child socks on grown feet.
2.0,"Oh my, this took quad-boob to a whole new level. I'm a 36D, and they were legit being cut in half by this."
2.0,"I bought this dress at $54.99 before tax. Pay for express shipping $39.99 to have it arrived on time for a prom. The fit is too loose, and the materials are cheap quality. The mesh layers outside are very stiff, feel like mosquitoes net. The seller agreed for my return, but I have to ship the dress back to China which cost between +$80 - +$90 for international shipping. Now I’m stuck with it. I regret to buy this dress.<br />I’ve found beautiful quality prom dresses from Macy’s and David’s Bridal. Of course they’re more expensive but I can try on different sizes to find my correct fit, high quality materials, free return and available in-store and online which worth the money I spent. You get what you pay for. I wish I thought about Macy’s and David’s Bridal from the start."
2.0,"Bought this hat for my 1 1/2 year old daughter. I ordered the size 1-3 years,  Hat came and was way to big. Fit a grown up with normal to small size head. Hat was good quality though, flower was on the larger size. If was the right size would have kept very cute look."
2.0,"Totally disappointed. This top looks cute in the ad pics, but what they don't reveal is the back is a solid white panel which completely spoils the entire striped look"
2.0,"these slippers are total crap, they are falling apart out of the box. craftsmanship on these took a backseat to marketing and look. VERY POORLY MADE"
2.0,All the finish fell off in the matter of days
2.0,Read reviews and had high hopes but fabric is that shiny polyester type and not soft or comfy so returning .
2.0,"too large , not true size"
2.0,"This is the account thing with getting items from Asia, you never know if the size it right. I used their chart and it's off. I should have used 5xl usual of the 3 it recommend."
2.0,Not flexible enough
2.0,This bag was wayy smaller than i thought it would be.<br />it is a cute little bag but i however like to at least put more than just a small wallet and change inside!<br /><br />so only buy if you do not really carry that much stuff . do not buy if you do usually carry alot of stuff or you<br />will be dissapointed
2.0,"The glasses arrived on time, but one of the lenses was cracked - not due to shipping either. The package was completely fine, so they were placed inside their (included) case, then inside the packaging with the cracks. Also, the nose pad wires seemed mangled. I tried them on anyway and they were super tight. It's def not one-size-fits-all, so unless you have a really small head these babies will squeeze your mellon nicely (hence some of the other reviews about leaving marks on their head after a few mins).<br /><br />Overall - cheaply made - spend more money on a better product is my advice!"
2.0,"I was excited to get a Coach purse like my dear late mother used to carry. She carried the same Coach for a decade. It was very utilitarian and obviously well-made and sturdy. After carrying Walmart and J.C. Penney purses for awhile, I thought I'd give this a try and get something a little more whimsical than dear Mother would have. I think this IS a well-made purse and would probably last a very long time, but I just don't love it. At all. And, even if this is a Coach Outlet rather than a Coach purse, for this kind of money, I need to love it. I don't. It's meh. It's going back. I bought a tie-dye Hobo Darling bag instead. Whimsical and I love it."
2.0,The earrings are very small
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress, but in the end I just didn't find it attractive or comfortable. Firstly, the material is a very scratchy polyester mix. Secondly, this ran VERY large. I am a curvy 5'6"" at 155 lbs, and I normally take a size medium or large. This was waaay too roomy on me, and bagged in all the wrong places. I would have been better off in a small. Secondly, the large band did not sit up under my breasts, but kept creeping upwards requiring me to constantly tug the band into place. Maybe, maybe if I had gotten the small, I would have appreciated the form fitting style, but even then the material was so uncomfortable, I was glad to take it off as soon as possible after putting the dress on. The pictures of others in this dress actually looked good, but its a no go for me."
2.0,"Ordered up, to a size large and still at least 1 or 2 sizes too small. Very soft, even after it was washed. Will not work as it’s way too small."
2.0,So thin and delicate I’m sure it will not hold up long. Forget about wearing with other bracelets. So thin it ends up under them.
2.0,This things is so tiny!!! Couldnt even get it over my arms. Definatley sending back
2.0,"Loved the wallet for the first month, for some reason it has now killed all my cards. Hotel keys don’t stand a chance as soon as I get one if it touches my wallet it’s dead."
2.0,I feel very disappointed. I am using it since a couple of weeks ago and the eye in the center is gone...disappear. I order it to an address in USA (my sister in law) but I am living in Lima (Perú). I work as astrologer and you can imagine how my image is affected.<br /><br />How can we solve this problem?...how my reputation will be fixed?<br /><br />Hope to hear from you as soon as possible. Thanks.<br /><br />P.D. Tried to send pic..failed..give me an email to send it..
2.0,The anklets were nice but the toe rings didn't fit my girlfriend and she has average sized feet.
2.0,"Just too small, not a 2X in the US for sure, if it were really a 2X then maybe I would like but hard to say as I am so disappointed about the size issue."
2.0,Broke within 2 weeks 😓
2.0,Although the shoes looked great they didn't last long at all! Within one week one of the shoes lights began to only work intermittently and then after four weeks one of the shoes began peeling.
2.0,"Ok suit, under skirt is like boy shorts-not comfortable for me and the ruffles on the front are on the back too, makes me feel like I have wings"
2.0,"I bought this bathrobe based on the cost and the reviews, it doesn't dry at all and leave brown cottons on your body. I needed an other shower to clean.<br />I'm going to return it."
2.0,The jacket is ok for the price.<br />Tag says hand wash only no tumble dry...that is inconvenient.
2.0,It says 2x plus sized but it was more juniors plus sized than womens plus size
2.0,"This top isn't as long as I expected. Didn't realize there was a seam running diagonal down the front into the knot either. It isn't horribly noticeable but definitely a little odd, lol. Overall I don't mind wearing it but I won't be purchasing anymore from this brand."
2.0,"I took this dress out of the box today, undid the zipper fine, but now whether holding it or wearing it, the zipper won’t go up more than an inch or so. :/ super disappointed because otherwise I like it quite a bit."
2.0,This dress is much much shorter than it looked in the photos.
2.0,"This neck gaiter has a seam versus seamless in others I have purchased. Also the filter pocket needs to be placed lower for better fit, it is also about 2 inches shorter than others I have bought.<br /><br />Ok item but a bit more searching may have better results."
2.0,"This is a cute tank top, but it runs a little small. I ordered a large ( which is my general size) and it just barely fits. It's too tight to wear in public , but I will wear it working out at home. The issue I have with this tanktop is that I washed it in cold water with  generally alike  colors, but it still stained my other clothes."
2.0,"The bathing suit was too small for me, but the if I was 2 sizes smaller it would have looked great!"
2.0,"The arms were extremely tight, otherwise the sizing was okay. But, the legs were quite long and it just didn't fit me well. It was also a pretty uncomfortable fabric, not breathable at all."
2.0,Very nice sock and they stayed on.  Unfortunately the first time I wore the black pair a hole developed above my big toe.  I take a size 7 shoe so my foot shouldn’t have happened.
2.0,The dress is cute but the dark blue/white stripes fabric is about as thin as tissue paper and the stitching is sketchy. I will be surprised if the dress survives more than a few wearings.
2.0,Tire the first time he wore it. Had to restitch it. Very flimsy material. Would not buy again.
2.0,Not a fan. but quality is good especially if you like a bigger bust
2.0,Poor quality. Way too large for my small wrists.
2.0,Super huge on my little girl. The top coulda worked but the bottoms seemed to be 3 sizes too big! Even with a swim diaper! Very cheap material and see-through.
2.0,fits really awkwardly all over the place. The neck was a bit high and tight. for a size large i thought the length was okay but the bottom of the  hoodie was a bit tight while the midsection was too big. im 5'5 and 200 lbs.
2.0,The dress was two sizes to small.
2.0,"The thin strips that go on sndal strips do no stick, move and do not serve their purpose at all. All the rest os ok."
2.0,"Way too low cut for me. I don’t mind cleavage, but this was too too."
2.0,Wanted to love these but they were too short for me. Like the high waist and the fit was fine but felt too much of a breeze - if you know what i mean!
2.0,These gloves are one size fits all so way too big for my hands. They are also itchy.
2.0,The earrings were smaller than I anticipated and don't seem to pick up much color when I wear them.  I find they don't go with nearly as much of my wardrobe as I had hoped.  I was disappointed as clip style dangle earrings that don't weigh too much are extremely hard to find.
2.0,"I actually have no idea how I ended up with this.  I ordered the blue cape with the arm warmers.  Somehow hoping that will arrive.  This cape is a pretty color, but not thick or warm.  It did not come with the arm warmers as pictured.  I live in New England and thereby, &#34;Thick and warm&#34; mean a lot thicker and warmer than this."
2.0,The fabric is nice and feels very comfortable. The sleeves are longer than the picture and I'm not a big fan of the ruffle on the bottom of the dress. The picture makes it look more flattering and the dress is a little to short for me too.
2.0,"I would say I have average mens hands, and the fingers are slightly too large which gives me some excess material at the tips of my fingers making it near impossible to use a touchscreen. This isn't a big deal, I can just pull each finger down individually until it is snug against my fingers.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the quality of the gloves. While they are nice and warm, the tips of the fingers are kind of stitched together to a point, making it very difficult to use the touchscreen on your phone. They aren't &#34;rounded&#34; like a good pair of gloves normally would be.<br /><br />Overall, they are an okay product, but I would not buy again or recommend to someone else. I am currently shopping for other gloves around."
2.0,The price was great but the item was worth the price.  It was very thin and cheap.  I had bought for a baptism but I'd be embarassed to use it.
2.0,Your sizes aren't like they say they are😕
2.0,"It's Blue -- very, very, very BLUE!"
2.0,"Update: unfortunately didn’t work for long.<br />I bought this chopper with a food grade glass bowl to chop up frozen food for my fish! I have slabs of beefheart mix for my DIscus fish, so I just cut off a chunk from the slab, toss it in the processor, and push the large button on top for a few seconds to mince the food enough for them to eat; it chops it frozen, no need to thaw. I wash the bowl in the dishwasher. This is WAY better than trying to chop up the frozen food with a sharp knife, and the price and size were perfect!"
2.0,The watch doesn't keep time.  I doesn't look like the picture. The part of the ban that is touching your wrist was wearing off after about a week. But is does look awesome.
2.0,The dress looks nothing like the picture. it is a flimsy piece of material and not at all anything I would wear outside of my home.
2.0,Bought these for my wife - she loves them.  recommend this product
2.0,"This blouse runs very big! I am normally an XL in blouses. Read several reviews before ordering and several said ‘size up’. Do not size up! I am broader in the shoulders and could have easily fit in a medium.<br />I don’t want to bother with another disappointment so this one is going back.<br />Material is thick, not thin.<br />Embroidery was decent.<br />I totally get that overseas designers/ manufacturers picture and size Americans as baby elephants… but come on!!! Please base your sizing off American sizing. There would definitely be less returns."
2.0,The shirt was way too small and ended up fitting my 6 year old so I just gave it to her. I was pretty disappointed that the shorts fit and the shirt didn't. I wouldn't recommend this and honestly I'd like a refund. This was not worth $16.
2.0,"Couldn't wear these, not very comfortable.."
2.0,"The elastic broke the second time I wore it, so it blows away now if I wear it riding. Now I have a crappy sweat rag with a brim, great."
2.0,Les doy un 6 de 10 cabe recalcar que no los uso no por feos si no porque están demasiado pesados. ☹️
2.0,"This dress runs WAY, WAY smaller than expected. I am not sure what xxl means in the plant where it was made but certainly not any xxl that I have been accustom to - very disappointed."
2.0,rather SMALL!
2.0,"Super comfortable, but faded significantly after first washing. Black and white dress is now a grey and white dress."
2.0,"I loved the look of these shorts online so I tried a size 10 and 12.  Both were too small in the waist while they fit in the hips and rear.  Just a strange fit, overall, probably since they are imported and not in standard U.S. sizing.  I'm 5'7"" 132 lbs. and usually wear a size 6 jean.  Returned both."
2.0,Sizing...these are not a good fit for women whose feet are under size 9 or even 10. The heel is up above my ankle and I’m a size 8.
2.0,it didnt fit like a pencil dress it was made like a a line dress.
2.0,"The size is too small for my face and my husband both.  It does stretch, however it hurts my ears after wearing it for just 10 minutes because it is so tight."
2.0,Cheap. Broke within days of wear.
2.0,"This bracelet is listed at 7+”. However, that is when the clap is open. It will not fit a wrist over 6”. Plus the clasp is pretty weak. The description says  for “girls AND women” but it would have to be a VERY small woman."
2.0,These are cute pants but way too short and I am only 5’4.
2.0,"Too large. Im 5'3 fit and 110lbs. too large on my back of the knees and inner thighs. I had to return it because i feel that after some use, it will be stretched out. Otherwise GREAT material for its price! Material is a little shiny. not sheer. Too bad it didn't fit me, wish they had an XS. But otherwise GREAT PRODUCT!"
2.0,"my buttcheeks hung out, other than that it was super cute. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because the first time I wore it, the should strap broke and the lace on it was coming apart."
2.0,It was way to small. I’m usually a woman’s medium but ordered a large so it was a little baggy. I tried the sweatshirt on and it felt like a kids size. Very cute design and color but not a good fit
2.0,These flippies wear out very quickly.  The foot pad went flat after a few wears and got a hole in the bottom below the big toe.  The part that crosses the top of the foot stretches out to the point that they will fall off when walking.  They were only worn in the house as house shoes so they didn't get a lot of wear before they started to break down.  I will look for a different brand next time I purchase.
2.0,These lasted maybe 2 weeks before ripping :( cute tho.
2.0,It is  a nice bra but it is very tight and small.
2.0,The strap clip broke a week after I got it..
2.0,"These pearls have the cheapest look ever. Definitely for costume and not wearing to dress up an outfit. I can't even tell you what I did with mine. I immediately went to the local Kohls and purchased some that looked so much better and because they were on sale, I paid may $5.00 more. I'll never get jewelry from here again."
2.0,"I was very excited to purchase these online due to the great reviews it got. Great workout pants for a decent price? I was all in. However, they are very thin (you can see your knees through them). The Jade was a beautiful bright color and the material is unbelievably soft. Unfortunately can't wear them to workout in again but will wear them around the house.<br /><br />I am 5'9&#34; and the 22&#34; is a tad long. Ordered a size Large and am 156 lbs. Probably should have gone for the Medium."
2.0,Disappointed was looking for fleece lined this is not
2.0,La talla es muy pequeña y no le quedo a mi niño
2.0,"I ignored the reviews that stated this product was to thick and  that it was difficult to push the button through the holes.  They were right.  It's well made, but difficult to use.  So much so, that it is just sitting in a drawer in my kitchen."
2.0,"The measurements given in description are incorrect. I'd say if you're a size 4/6 and smaller  this dress would work. And make sure you have bone skinny arms. It is beautiful though. Nice fabric and great style...hence, the 2 stars."
2.0,too small your warnings about size are not even close I upsized and still will only be able to wear it with something underneath
2.0,too small i send it back
2.0,"The shoe is extremely stiff and uncomfortable, the sizing is very thin and the toecap hurts. Hurts to wear and play in"
2.0,"I so wanted this dress to work!! It is so pretty very nicely made and would be perfect for so many things in the summer, I bought it to wear to a wedding.  But alas it wasn't meant to be :( as many other people have said this dress is not for anyone with any kind of chest.  I'm a 34DD and I order a large hoping that it would give me some additional coverage...but it did not.  It was busting open and even with wearing a cami underneath it just wasn't going to fit or lay right.  So sadly I had to return this but it really is a beautiful dress"
2.0,"The main description, or heading for this product should be changed as it is NOT leather. It was my mistake for thinking it would be! When I received it, I double checked the page here on Amazon, and sure enough,  the little specs chart says it is made of PU. :(  Again, my fault,  but the heading is deceptive. Be sure to read every little thing on the page! - The stars are what seem to be plastic beads, and  they flip, roll, turn, and all fall to the underside of the bracelet by the clasp.  What good are the stars when they fall to the underside of my wrist where they cannot be seen? I ordered this specifically for the star design,  but it is poorly executed.  If I keep it,  I may try to glue the stars in place or something. The fit is a bit sloppy for me with this wrap bracelet as I have small wrists.  I may have to return this,  as it is just not the best purchase. - The good thing is that it has a strong magnetic clasp."
2.0,The lace was already torn off the first pair I tried. They're cute and fit fine but are very poor quality.
2.0,"Cute dress, even though the sleeves are fairly small and tight on the arms. The material also tends to wrinkle up right away."
2.0,I had a pair of these that i absolutely loved but i lost them so i decided to buy another pair and get a size bigger..i paid almost 20 dollars wore them for 2 days and one of the bars completely broke off the earring!!! not impressed!! seems like these ones were cheaply made..
2.0,I was disappointed in these earrings and returned them.  Some  may love them but to me they just didn’t look like the picture.
2.0,Broke 2 days after receiving it. My daughter was so upset
2.0,Got runners after the first use
2.0,Came with arms and legs broke off but grandaughter really wanted it so we duck taped it . It’s working out ok but the tape not holding as firm as I like. Grandkids love it
2.0,it’s comfortable that’s why not for me.<br />maybe good for already have a  good body shape people’s<br />this one not the tight hold body. really cozy feeling.<br />if you have a chunky belly like a me.(after baby birth) can showing to people about the belly :(
2.0,I ended up returning this immediately because it's just too small to be comfortable.  I am generally a size 8.5-9 and these didn't make it to the end of my heel.  Unfortunate but they had to go back.
2.0,"You're gonna want to size up one from your usual size. The chamois (pad) is not that great, borderline useless. I'd save your money and get a different short for cycling"
2.0,"Im glad he like it,i dont need to return it but completely delivered wrong item,but for the product its okay."
2.0,Quality was poor case broke and it was not inexpensive!
2.0,Terrible jacket.  Sleeves are short and the tie just makes the jacket look strange.
2.0,"Nice material but a very strange cut. Did not come off looking like the model.  I’m shorter, 5’2”, do maybe that’s it. Just bummed it didn’t work out."
2.0,Looks really cute. But my band broke four days into the purchase. Had to try to glue it
2.0,"The cloth is good material but, the inside of the mask is loose so when i breath the cloth covers my nose and mouth. The nose clip is high and doesn't really work."
2.0,I ordered this dress for my wedding. I was very displeased. The sash was missing and it looks nothing like the picture. I don’t have time to return it as this was a last minute purchase because the first dress did not fit. Very disheartening!
2.0,"Very nice and light my husband loved, unfortunately the first time her wore it, it was broken within 2hrs."
2.0,Beautiful and  well made but way too small.  Not realistic sizes for most Americans.
2.0,"The necklace is cute but the centerstone is not centered. Pretty enough, but the offset is driving me crazy"
2.0,"Much too big to ever wear, but if you have a larger nose, it might seem normal."
2.0,This cap is really cute but runs really small. I don't consider myself as having a large head and have never had a problem with caps fitting before. This truly is like a youth size.
2.0,"Nice design but it was hard to see the time, especially in dark. The hand colors were red for the hour and white for the minutes. But since white stands out, it appears like the hour. Too bad..."
2.0,"Not great quality, priced accordingly. Clingy..."
2.0,Nothing like the picture. Neck part of sweater looks like a regular sweater v-neck. Pull string small like a shoelaces and not big and puffy like the picture. Material is thin and scratchy not soft and fluffy like picture.
2.0,The sizes are nuts
2.0,"I have an older version of this jacket which fits a little loose, just perfect for layers.  I ordered this jacket in the same size and it is WAY to small.  Extremely disappointed since I have been looking for this brand in stores for over a year.  The item looks great and arrived on time but will have to be returned."
2.0,Not for small kids. Big
2.0,Within a few days the metal piece that adjusts the straps fell off. We couldn't find the piece and now they are useless. We were disappointed.
2.0,Much smaller than anticipated.  Returned the item.
2.0,The dress was to small & to short.  The color was beautiful
2.0,"Looks much nicer in the picture . Poor quality , shorter than expected and much smaller than expected."
2.0,"I did not buy this item, but caution to potential buyers: the symbol on the back of the pendent, the unfinished pyramid, is not a masonic symbol. If you do not believe me, do some searching on google or any other search engine."
2.0,The seems are not well stiched the elastic not well attached.<br />I was disappointed ☹️
2.0,"I am not convinced that this necklace is actually 14kgold plated. If it is, it looks low quality. Even straight out of the box, it looks more of a bronze color than gold (see pictures side by side with a 14k gold plated necklace I owned before)"
2.0,"I really like the style and feel of these glasses but, the lenses are not clear. Not sure if it's distortion or what."
2.0,I’ve talked to several woman who have the same complaint. Hope somehow they could make them smaller
2.0,To big...Fit was boxy.
2.0,"Not as pictured, material sux"
2.0,"I thought it came w 2, one per foot. I thought it actually had a titanium arch, not woven in so u can't feel it or even tell it's there or feel it's working. I was going to send it back, UNUSED but, I'm being charged HALF of what it cost to return it!?? Seriously?? Cheaper to keep it & sell on line!!"
2.0,"Doesn't really look like the picture, and the quality isn't the best. save your money"
2.0,"Rolls down your arm no matter how many times you lift it up, fix it or stuff it in your armpit<br />I’m back to wearing a long sleaved shirt under my work shirt to hide my tattoos in the dead of summer because this is useless<br />2 stars for fast delivery and I liked the texture of the material"
2.0,I ordered the dark green and got a teal color. I would just keep it but the color doesn't match anything I own. Soft though.
2.0,"This set is great. Holds everything my wife needs for work. The smaller handles look a bit cheap but the longer handle looks and feels stronger. Wife loves it so I am pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />So its been 5 months since my wife has been using this bag. The body looks good. However, the long removable strap  cannot handle too much weight. All she holds in there is wallet, phone, keys glasses case and small umbrella. Today it just broke off and her bag fell. Very embarrassing! Very upsetting."
2.0,"I have a pair of these pants in XL and wanted a size L because while the pants are everything that I loved I have lost 10 pounds and they are getting a little loose. I was so happy to find them on Amazon because they no longer sell them in local stores. But, they sent me a totally different pair of pants. These are mid rise and not high rise like advertised and shown. I really hate it when companies bait and switch like this, I am keeping them because they are nice quality pants but will probably gift them to my sister."
2.0,I believe my headline says it all.
2.0,Must have been designed for a pinhead.
2.0,Didn't fit good!!
2.0,"Cheap cheap cheap!!! They do NOT hold up, even a little! I mean they look cute and all, that’s the only reason they got 2 stars, but they also break with the slightest bit of stretch. I’m a pretty ✨thicc✨ woman and these just couldn’t cut it."
2.0,This is definitely not long. Its the length of a normal T-shirt so it isn't great for leggings. Super disappointed. I would've given it 4 stars if it were as described.
2.0,"The top is short so only but if you want your midriff showing. Also, it is not cotton."
2.0,I don't think those socks are 100% cotton. They are not comfortable to wear.
2.0,Price was right as far as quality feathers kept coming off but what do u want for the price shipping was fast and only wanted it for Halloween
2.0,look great but are fragile.  Not easy to see in low light.  But if you want to feel like your on mars they work great!!<br /><br />Saffron from Mars!
2.0,"Product looks cool, that’s the best part.  It smells a bit weird but that’s easy to get over.  The lights did not work.  It was clearly returned before delivered to us.  The wires inside were completely exposed and the bulb in the mind stone had burned through the plastic.  My kid liked it enough so we pulled the wires out & let him use it anyway.  This product really had potential.  Hope it was just ours that had the problem."
2.0,the tips are sharp they hurt
2.0,"5'10"" / 150lbs / 36c / ordered a medium<br /><br />Disappointed because the design of this top is cute but the fit is way off. It was loose in the chest but a bit tight around the neck and the elastic back is huge and makes the whole thing look awkward and cheap. Fabric choice isn't great and it's much more dull in person."
2.0,"The jacket looks nice from afar, but the buttons seem to be a cheaper plastic and very loose on the jacket"
2.0,This is not the most ideal fit for sleeping in. It is to long and it clings to the breast area and the sleeves are to long for short people. It is like putting on a maxie dress to go to sleep in. I will not be wearing this much.  I would not recommend this for short person.
2.0,"I wish they didn't have a elastic on the waist, other than that I reorder a larger size, cause I did like them!"
2.0,"Dress is a bit brighter red than in the picture, but it’s still pretty. Bottom half fits great and makes your behind look good! Top half fits very awkward and uncomfortable. The straps only hug around tops of your arms so it would be scary to wear in public - your entire back is visible and it comes down pretty low, so be aware of that. It could work maybe with a shawl maybe."
2.0,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but I couldn’t get these on. I have a 28” waist and 41” hips, and I first tried the S-M based on others’ reviews. Nope, couldn’t get them up. I ordered a L-XL, and still couldn’t get them up all the way past my hips. I wear an 8-10 or M in most things, so I was surprised I couldn’t wear these. L-XL is supposed to fit up to size 24, but I don’t see how since they didn’t even fit me at size 10. I liked the material and they were soft, so it’s too bad."
2.0,"Couldn't quite tell if this was silver or not.. seemed really light for how much metal was there. Also, the edges are jagged and not rounded off, and some links did not seem to mesh together properly. Very low quality in my opinion. Had to return because I have a higher standard for things I wear all day long every day for decades. Would recommend necklaces by dreamland jewelry. I've been wearing theirs almost every day for over 10 years and loved it, just wanted to get a bigger size. Will be replacing these with one from dreamland."
2.0,"I was excited to try this and ordered an extra large per the measurement chart. The seaming was fine and I really loved the color. It runs very small. The bust, arms and hips were snug. It also seemed really short. I’m only 5’4” and it barely covered the booty. If you’re looking for a flowier fit, definitely go up a size or two. It was also really staticky out of the bag which made the initial try in even more challenging."
2.0,"Cute design. I really wanted to like this shirt and wear it as a favorite item, but it does not breathe. I wore it on a walk on day and I thought I was going to die. It was like being in an easy bake oven. Gonna have to return. No need in keeping it if I am going to be uncomfortable."
2.0,This is so see-through. I bought it to wear over a bathing suit and it still feels trashy to have my bathing suit so visible
2.0,This is very pretty from afar but once I opened the bag I hated the feel of the fabric and the top of the dress was too small. I don’t know if it wasn’t seen right but it fit everywhere but through the bust and the part of the dress where the sleeves were sewn on. Weird fit for me.
2.0,"Don't buy, too poor of a quality, not worth your money. Sizes are off- I bought a size large but it fits like a small or xsmall. (I'm 4'9 108 lb) $17 price tag on a 5$ quality fabric and work."
2.0,it washed off too soon. i just got this last week but it has washed off already.. very bad
2.0,They are nice but they hurt. I could not keep them on my nose nor ear long
2.0,"I like the idea of silver and gold but the picture in the listing looks nothing like the actual band. If you want to look like a bratz doll, go for it but if you were looking for a classier look, look further. I will cut off the elastic and use the adaptors to DIY with a a elastic I have at home."
2.0,I liked the bracelet initially. But in less than a month the clasp area fell apart. I’m returning and won’t order another.
2.0,The fit was fine but the zipper was very irritating.  The zipper was not covered enough to prevent irritation.
2.0,I was excited to do my nails until I opened the powders. The solid colors are fine. The powder is really fine. The sparkle ones are not. I have to crush it up before I can use it. And I don't think I will be able to make it as fine as it should be. Disappointing.
2.0,"They seemed well made and I was excited to get them as the idea seemed simple enough.  They bunch up, roll up and were very uncomfortable.  They even got above the waistband of my jeans and were rubbing on me."
2.0,"The material was nice. But it was way too big. It came days later than expected so even if it did for, I wouldn't have been able to wear it to my event."
2.0,Meh. Got a small but a bit shapeless/too big still. Looks a bit cheap as well and felt like I was wearing a tablecloth. Probably better for a taller person.
2.0,This product looks nice in the photos but it is super cheap in person.
2.0,just get the real thing
2.0,Seems cute…but missing the bottoms
2.0,"Support in all the wrong areas, and the sizing is way off."
2.0,"Loved the style, but 2 out of the 3 bracelets had the color chipped off of several beads.<br />Return was super easy."
2.0,"Up until today, I would have given this 5 stars. When I went to zip it today, the zipper pull assembly came completely off the zipper track and there’s no way to reattach it. I haven’t even had it for a month and I was zipping a bag that was not even half full - no strain on the zipper. I loved the size and style of the bag so I am VERY disappointed."
2.0,This product is not as advertised. I bought it because it was labeled fleece. It is not fleece the fabric has very little give. Well made but not as advertised.
2.0,I was a little disappointed that the writing/message on the necklace is cut off on the edge. You can see the whole quote.
2.0,Not the best quality and the color is a little lighter than the picture.
2.0,These glasses are cheap Made in China stuff. The brand reads &#34;VELENTINO&#34;. Also I have a round face and the frame is not as big as I expected.
2.0,"The shirt itself is super cute. Length was perfect and looked like a normal large shirt.  I washed it and hung to dry. Once dried, I put it on and it like two sizes too small. It was like trying on a large in kids, not adult."
2.0,good shorts but run really small
2.0,SEND ME MY CHARMS ONLY  A  J  S  B  L  5 seperate  ones of course....Tired of fighting with you and Youthway Copper .Get it together......PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
2.0,"Returned, too large, not as expected in description."
2.0,I'm 5'10 and the dress came at my knee. I was looking for a true midi.
2.0,"Actually not a terrible hat. A little low on the sides, but overall decent. The manufacturing is cheap and one of holes on the front was never sewn in correctly (the threads are already showing), so I'm sure that'll be where the thing falls apart. But, for the price, that's to be expected. I'd maybe rate the hat at 3 stars, 4 stars if it arrived fully assembled.<br /><br />However, I'm put off by this &#34;sales campaign.&#34; This manufacturer is paying customers to leave 5 star reviews. Here goes my free hat."
2.0,"Stretchy as expected, but fits too loose. Doesn't stay up over your nose. On top of it, instead of 12 filters, there was only 10 filters. I'll probably return the item."
2.0,"Runs a little smaller than expected. The padding is free floating and bunches while putting on. The neckline and armholes don't have any stretch. I wanted these for nursing bras, but because the neckline doesn't stretch and the padding floats and bunches when moving the bra, they do not work for that purpose. But they are fairly comfortable and seemingly well made."
2.0,"way too small, nice bra if it was true to size."
2.0,"Sizing and length are good, and they are comfortable, but cut of these pants isn’t flattering, and the fabric is clingy and thin. I’ll keep them to wear with tunics,  but b/c of the odd draping in the front, I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing them with a tee or shorter top."
2.0,"One extra star because I like the WXXM sleek gray/black design and the logo. Also, there is quality in the making. Other than that -horrible.<br />I don’t know about wearing these during outdoor winter sporting -they’re probably good for cold sweating, but I thought I was getting a nice pair of thick, warm wool socks for the winter. These are not wool socks just because there’s 8% somewhere in them. Actually, when I put them on, they made my feet feel colder. ? Wore these outside, layered over two other pairs of regular socks, and felt the cold go right through them. The material is scratchy and snags on my nails and everything else.<br /><br />Other problem is the fit. The foot part is huge (I wear women’s 10) and the calve part is tight - I have super skinny 11” calves. The top band was so tight below my knee I thought my circulation would be cut off. Where the top hits on my leg is weird. It’s right in the middle of my knee, depending on how I adjust it. On the knee though is better than below it because it’s so tight. I don’t see how anyone with calves could possibly wear these comfortably.<br />They are also ridiculously difficult to put on and remove, and I’ve worn some pretty hardcore “real” compression socks. It makes no sense. Nothing about these socks do.<br /><br />I wear strong compression stockings pretty regular and find these like weird, loose compressions that are super tight in all the wrong places. If your feet can fit these your calves are probably too large. I wouldn’t risk it.<br />I don’t know what I’m going to do with these nonsensical socks....<br />Do not recommend. You can find far better for under $15."
2.0,One band won't stay clipped on
2.0,The way the neckline is sewn makes this sweater lay funny on your neck and also feels slightly funny.
2.0,stones make this really itchy and uncomfortable
2.0,"very sheer, and only for small breasted women. and doesn't come close to hanging off the shoulder unless a child is wearing it."
2.0,"Fit a bit loose and water Keeps flushing, I got cold pretty soon"
2.0,The fit was disappointing and the velcro on the neck irritated my neck. It was uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"I bought this for my girlfriend. She loves the design but the cat is so thin that it is bending. Also, the chain broke and now it needs to be replaced."
2.0,"Not meant for people with curves. Unfortunately I had to return it because the waist belt seams in back dug into my lower back/top of my butt. When I added my gear it was excruciating no matter how I adjusted it unless in put it under my hips and butt but then it was slip off and all the weight was on my shoulders. Not a great design for people with hips, butts or love handles and I'm 5'2"" and 120lbs so I don't have much chub.<br /><br />Company was amazing at communication and the return was super easy! I'm bummed it didn't work out for me!"
2.0,"Looks fine and fits my watch,  but its super annoying. I have a small wrist and the straps that hold the excess band down move around the band and the excess band pops out several times a day. I'm constantly straightening it back up. I've never had a watch band to do this.  It's VERY stiff, not sure if that contributes to the problem or not.<br />Unless you like your watches very,  very tight on your wrist, I'd find another option."
2.0,"Ordered and received 4x size...not even close, I don't think it would fit on a large  !!"
2.0,Pilled quickly. Hair and lint magnet.
2.0,The hook that goes into the ear is too large & very rough. Doesn’t go into my ear at all
2.0,"I ordered a large according to the measurements and the bottoms were too tight, the top was falling off and my boobs were hanging out the sides and bottoms of the boob cups.. It's like I needed a medium top with XL boob cups. (I'm not small I weigh 165 so I didn't think the top would be too big) The sizing is off, I was going to order another but I don't think they have one for me.. Waiting for my label to return it."
2.0,Some work on my glasses and some don’t. They should be more specific on what type of glasses they work in.
2.0,The zipper pulls snapped off on the large case after first use. The zipper separated on the medium size case after one use also.... total waste of money.
2.0,I expected these to stay in the boots but they pull out . Seams are really uncomfortable and so it would be better to just wear socks. Contacted seller and meh response. Very dismissive.
2.0,"Shrunk in the wash, fits not how expected. When I bought it, it fit on me but poofed out way more then expected and did not look attractive. I washed it in attempt to get the fabric to settle more and it just shrunk so now it does not fit at all unless I want to wear a crop top...that being said, it is the color and design I ordered so it gets some stars for that."
2.0,"This was cute. But runs very small. I ordered up, and still had to send it back because it was too small."
2.0,The chockers are really cute and that's about the only reason why I give it two stars. The material is cheap but you can't expect it to be high quality for the price. One of them broke before I put it on but the others seem to hold up pretty well.
2.0,These for nice BUT are extremely hard to get closed once you have them in also the amallest psir is to small to close
2.0,"Great color, material, I literally didn’t like how it looked on me. Oh yeah..GREAT PRICE!!!"
2.0,Flimsy lenses scratched and they were smashed
2.0,I bought this thinking it will fit.  Well it is a little tight in the back then the front was to big for my chest area.  I'm a size 36B but it did not fit.
2.0,Sole is very poor and uncomfortable on uneven surfaces
2.0,It was super small and the necklace part was so thin and cheap
2.0,I have another Piko top that I love. This one is flowy and is okay but arms are super tight. It is also shorter in back than front. It just doesn't fit right to me. If I went up a size it would be too large. I'll only buy this brand in shop and not online again.
2.0,"Ok, just don’t stay on"
2.0,"These earring were just what I was looking for, I was happy when they finally arrived, (understandable that this pandemic made this be delayed). I wore one to the store and as I was walking it broke off, then the other one was while I was home."
2.0,"Good material. Good value. But each pair in the five pack rode up my leg and had me adjusting throughout the day. In the end, it’s just not worth it if you have to be pulling them back down every 10-15 minutes."
2.0,could not use it because it looked like my toddler's head was being crushed. returned it.
2.0,I love this hat but there were some glaring issues. One is the White Tree of Gondor is stitched off center. The other is the cap sits on my head somewhat tilted. I've tried to straighten it out but nothing worked. Wish this was of better quality as I love the White Tree logo
2.0,The lining is too clingy and difficult to put on over a wet swimsuit.
2.0,Really cute but it broke the first time I wore it
2.0,"Weird cut, runs small, short torso"
2.0,Cute pants but not squat proof and no compression.  Sent back.  Don’t wear these on leg day!!
2.0,they loose tey shape after first wash
2.0,Does not click w Fitbit.  Cannot use!
2.0,"Straps are too short for my wrist, barely reached the second hole with very little left to put in steel hoop.  In fact could only use one of the two hoops .  Just for your information, I normally order a 8&#34; when I'm ordering a paracord wrist band, a 7' one wouldn't reach."
2.0,Really cheap fabric and sewing.
2.0,looks cheap in person.
2.0,not a lot of stretching
2.0,"When I put this on I felt like I should go paint a house. It's not the worst thing ever but it's not the best. Definitely needs a belt so you don't look like a painter, And not good for people with long torsos as it will slightly give you cameltoe Which is never fun for anyone ."
2.0,"This would be a great Mask, because its so adjustable and comfortable for people with beards. but too difficult to put the filter in narrow opening and then there are no guides to keep the filter in place , so it slides around like pocket change and there goes your protection while keep taking it off to adjust the filter."
2.0,The buckle has already broke after 6 weeks.<br />Not good quality at all.
2.0,It was a little too tight for me. I just wasn't a fan on how it looked on me. It sat really funny. Maybe get at least one size up.
2.0,Returned not as expected
2.0,These pants are semi see-through. Did not pass the gym test. Cute color though. I got the pink. Not bad for the price.
2.0,I wear a size 5 ring and when I received this one it was too small. I could not get on my finger. I am wearing another size 5 ring that fits perfectly.
2.0,I would love to give this 5 stars but the string band spelt like an old dirty sweaty towel after washing hands so often.  Also the ties kept on coming apart until finally lost the beads.  Bought this for my daughter 7 and myself.  But both are broken/stinky after 3 weeks.
2.0,The more I wore it the worse it looked .
2.0,feels very light weight and cheap
2.0,"The band is nice and seems to be of good quality, but it has a raised connector inside of the band. This cause some discomfort but most annoying thing is it unlatches OFTEN!! I've only had it a full 24hrs and I went back to my old broken watch band because it stays latched."
2.0,"They were just too big for me. Cute, though!"
2.0,"I wanted a sweatshirt, but this is an odd stretchy material. I can't recommend it."
2.0,"When using a previous order to re order a PAIR of the 365 sleeper earrings, the description was changed and you now only receive 1 earring. Very deceiving, not sure if company is at fault or Amazon programing. Price is also then double what it used to be when you only receive 1 earring. Not going buy again if this is what I will get. Product itself is great, no complaints with quality. Just the postings are getting more deceptive."
2.0,"The B is a great size, but the chain is so small it’s like a choker and I hate that."
2.0,"Go down a size. Also for you short girls, this will be very long on you. I am 5'3&#34; and it is long, hitting at an award height on my leg."
2.0,Not worth it. Tarnished faster than forever 21 jewlery.
2.0,The quality seems to be good. My issue is that I wear a size 8 and when they arrived it wouldn't fit my pinky. I order size 9 and those fit but cut off circulation. I just placed my third order (size 10) hopefully that works.
2.0,Size matters! This product is small meaning the shank is short - very short; but the good news is it’s beautiful just TOO small for me to use.
2.0,"Awful fit. I am a plus size, but still with a waistline/hourglass shape and this dress hits all the wrong spots. I love a good empire waist shirt or dress, but this one flares out and was hideous on my shape. Immediately returned it."
2.0,Not the quality I expected.  Looks better online.
2.0,Was sent two left earrings.
2.0,"It was really large and the material was really thin and uncomfortable. It felt like the thin, stiff lining you sometimes have under fancy dresses."
2.0,"Sadly, these had to be returned. They were very pretty, but heavy and hung down oddly because of the placement of the post relative to how heavy they were."
2.0,I liked the idea of the skirt being a little longer in the back but it’s too much longer and feels heavy like a drape hanging on you.  Not comfortable at all.
2.0,It ripped as soon as put my leg in the leggings. Super tight material that does not hold all the threading together.
2.0,"Nice style, but the size is way too small - shift the sized down by two (2X should be L, XL should be medium, etc.)"
2.0,"I want to love these, but all 3 pairs I've had stretch out at the bottoms and become saggy. Folding dosent even help and they just look messy to where I don't want to wear them."
2.0,Way too small to wear.
2.0,Wore for less than a week before it broke
2.0,Returned it. Fabric was still and uncomfortable. I just wanted to wear it under a long sleeved shirt -- too heavy and stiff for that.
2.0,Hated the material super thin and cheap and way to small gave it away. I almost threw it away
2.0,"The material felt nice, it seemed to be sown well enough. But unfortunately the sizing was way off. I normally wear a small and this one fit me like a potato sack. It looked so boxy and loose. I unfortunately had to return it."
2.0,I understand it says one size fits most but oh my. This sweater has some stretch but not meant for anyone bigger than a medium. Ended up giving it to a friend who wears small and barely loose on her.
2.0,These were a good value but not as stylish as I thought. The pic is somewhat deceiving. The actual shoes have these very visible pores on the sides. The Goodyear model is much much cuter.
2.0,Not for large busted women
2.0,Really cute but starting to snag only after a few washes.  I always wash delicate and hang dry and noticing sone small tears in the matetial
2.0,Only wore these a couple of times before they looked tarnished and the gold finish faded.
2.0,This ring is kind of one size which didn't fit any of my fingers. It is very thin but seems to be made well. I'm sad it doesn't fit and will see if it fits my sisters fingers (any of them!) she's a nurse so quite fit ting if it fits. Just sad it doesn't fit me
2.0,Too small for child’s head
2.0,Material texture and color not as expected or described
2.0,"""Large"" size is barely a ""Medium"". Quality seems OK."
2.0,My daughter loved it so much but the latch from the heart to the chain broke very quickly and she was so sad.
2.0,You get what you paided for. It is cute but kinda cheap looking and the black has no pocket which is why I wanted it. The dress in the main photo is not the same dress cause it looks like a cotton mix kind of dress and the actual dress is all polyester. The fit was good and I got the large which fit snug in the arms and I can move in it. I was going to return it but I think I can still wear it. I hate being fooled by these companies since they have a dress in the picture and you get something else. I would have paid a little more money for better quality cause I wanted freaking dress with a pocket! So 2 stars cause I kept it.
2.0,I was really excited for this shirt. It’s thinner than expected. You can see right through it.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these shoes.  They are super cute and very light.  However, I should have taken the advice of those who left previous reviews on the fit.  I'm an 8 and I ordered a size 8 since they don't offer these in 1/2 sizes.  They're fine for walking around the block to pick something up or maybe just running some short errand but when wearing them all day long walking around a city (which is what I did during vacation) my feet and knees were hurting. I tried a few times during my trip to wear them all day long and each time I did, I regretted it.  I wished they were offered in an 8.5.  That would have made a big difference."
2.0,Not right style. Broken when delivered.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this set until I actually saw it, I was embarrassed to gift it, so I didnt.  There were bubbles in the gold plating; it looks cheaper than the actual cost, and it didn't cost too much.  The design is nice but the quality is poor to fair.  If it didn't have the bubbles, it would be at least fair."
2.0,The bras were not true to size and they rub really bad so they were not comfortable at all but they are really  pretty
2.0,Too small. Arm area was also quite tight..
2.0,They're ok at 40mph but hit the highway and you're knees won't be the only thing in the breeze......
2.0,Very smelly upon opening package. Major disappointment when I felt the slick plastic instead of leather. They are going back where they came from.
2.0,"Item is true to size however, to flimsy for a blazer."
2.0,Sized way to small and had scratchy material. Bottom is very near a thong.
2.0,I ordered size 3x. The tanks tops I received looked like they &#34;might&#34; fit a 12 year old girl. So disappointed!!! I am returning them asap.
2.0,"This item was a gift but could not be given the under side was too rough the prongs were sticking out and should have been lined with felt cloth or something. Otherwise the necklace looks great, thinking of returning it."
2.0,"This looks like a women's army hat. Too small, after you try it on, due to the small size, the army hat shape is gone as it tries to fit your head, hence it looks like a regular cap, plus the strap on the backside is just too short"
2.0,"They fit & worked Great! However, on 1st wash (hand wash in sink w/1/2 soap sheet) let them rinse for few hours in standing sink water. When I pulled up to rink & Pat dry - 1 sleeve sock had fallen apart at toe area. Small cuff that was around toe - fell apart & unraveled material if pulled. Luckily I know how to sew & just need to find matching color for thread!  OR do I just send back ??"
2.0,It's good for the price. I gave only two stars because it came with no earring back or push backs. So I have to find some that match it which is just added pain. Also there is a stain on one of the earrings which I'm hoping no one will notice.
2.0,"Red spot on the white section,  poor material"
2.0,"I bought the blue nightgown with white polka dots several months ago. I really liked it so I bought another - the navy with red stripes. I bought it in the exact same size, but it fits NOTHING like the other. In fact, after I washed and put it on (and I laundered it the same way I launder the other one that I have) I thought surely I must have ordered the wrong size. But nope - the tag says it's the same size as the other one I got. The sleeves only come 3/4 way down my arm when EXTENDED (i.e., not buttoned up), it is MUCH shorter than the other one I purchased, etc. Perhaps the tag is wrong? This is SO much smaller than the other one all around. Whether it's that or just really inconsistent sizing across the different colors, I am really disappointed that the fit is so off. Unfortunately I have already washed the item so I'm stuck with it."
2.0,"I thought they were great. Very comfortable, but I wore the charcoal ones once and they got a run in the ass. Not to happy about quality, did nothing that would justify getting a run in them."
2.0,It's asymmetrical
2.0,Too frumpy
2.0,Looks weird on your face. Print on both sides and it’s like odd to have a neck mouth. Kind of a waste of $$$. Wouldn’t truly recommend.
2.0,"After chunking down nearly 30.00 for this mask, due to reviews and similarity to an N95, it arrives and looks like something I could have purchased at Krogers. There is no respirator embedded, the logo is not printed as noted on the box, but most importantly THERE is NO RESPIRATOR. Period. I contacted Amazon and they indicated as this is a 3rd party seller, I will not receive support without their response. 48 hours no - no response from this seller. I do not recommend buying this item if you are travelling, or flying internationally. It is not as advertised."
2.0,A 3x i more like a large. Runs very small
2.0,"Very nice, but not authentic, i was expecting something better for the price,let me tell you theyre a nice copy of rayban probably you cant notice that theyre fake, first time very disapointed about an item that a bought in amazon."
2.0,Item is nice on the photo but it need to come with instructions. Very difficult to put on.
2.0,These are really thin material and very cheap quality feeling. I don’t think they would last very long before falling apart. Gonna return them.
2.0,At least 3 sizes smaller than I ordered...No size or fabric content tags on item...not even sure was size it was suppose to be.  Returning it. Bra was an A cup when the size was suppose to be XXL!
2.0,Was very disappointed to open my package and inspect my item only to find a sewing mistake right in the front where everyone could see it. Flimsy material. Shoddy workmanship. Bought this dress as a mother-of-the-bride dress for my daughter's beach side wedding ceremony. Never wore it.  Too cheap looking. I cannot recommend.
2.0,The first time I put it on one of the elastic eye holes for button came out of the seam of the shirt.
2.0,Fabric very flimsy and had no body so did not look as pictured.
2.0,"For the price, it is an OK windbreaker. But it is not a rain jacket. It is not waterproof. And during a rain shower, water leaked through the fabric and I got all wet."
2.0,Brings the boobs together nicely but no lift
2.0,"Did not arrive when stated. Kinda cheap, and fits tight (more like a choker) I'm only keeping  because it would cost me more to return."
2.0,These are not hypoallergenic.
2.0,"I love the looks of this band.  I have only worn it for 2-3 days.  It is already beginning to lose the color off the band under my wrist.  As far as durability, it seems like it won’t last very long before it breaks at the latching point.  Quite flimsy."
2.0,It fit nice on the bottom part of my body but the top it’s hard to keep onto shoulders and I had small breast size so when I tried to wear it have zipping like shown on model and the zipper would continue to unzipping all the way down.
2.0,"The burgundy color is pretty. Fabric is itchy and scratchy. The dress was not flattering on me who is curvy compared to the picture model. Unfortunately, I can only return if I ship it back to China. NOT Free Return as stated."
2.0,Didn’t change colors
2.0,"We were very excited to find a Hawaiian shirt within our budget but this is definitely an excellent example of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;! The material is so thin you can see right through it is places, and there were several small holes. While it looks great from a distance, I doubt it will last long. Not worth the money!"
2.0,made for skinny people
2.0,"Broke too easily, lens continues to pop out."
2.0,They’re alright but not what I expected will wear around the house
2.0,It's very small and has a very low RPM spindle.  It does an OK job but nothing special.  Directions in English would be nice too so you can understand the attachements.
2.0,Super cute but some of the stitching wasn’t sewn correctly!
2.0,"The product is OK, but I was expecting a softer leather and another tone of gold. The gold color looks really fake and the strap is a little stiff."
2.0,I used the sizing chart for this order but it was huge! I should have sent it back but didn't have time since I needed to wear the next day.
2.0,"It’s pretty cheaply made. Walmart has better quality fabric this this. (Not bashing Walmart I love Walmart, just was expecting something a little better)"
2.0,Very disappointed in this top poorly made and cheap fabric
2.0,"My husband got me this “hoodie” because it looks like one of our huskies, Drogo.<br />He bought me the men’s large.<br />Well first off, it’s very thin! The large men’s fits more like a large child, it’s fits small, the arms are tight and when I put my hand in the pocket, it ripped.<br />I’m not happy with this shirt at all.<br />It’s as thin as a t-shirt, like a fall/spring shirt, not made for cold weather at all."
2.0,"Unfortunately, these were a no for me. So many great reviews, I had to give them a try. Im curvy w/ a smaller waist & these flattened my butt and gave me a camel toe. Ugh! No thanks."
2.0,"too thin, it seems like it will rip off as soon as I wear it"
2.0,"my daughter loves these, but they shrank a lot after a few washes."
2.0,very rough on the bottom of your feet when you walk and do not stay up.
2.0,"If it weren't 5 sizes too big, I'd have loved this dress.  Returning.  Careful of sizing here, potential buyers!"
2.0,"Could not adjust as I desired, was very difficult to adjust."
2.0,"When I pulled it out of the bag, I loved the color. The material was decent and it does have some weight to it.<br />But the overall “style” was not what I was expecting. Theres a weird collar situation happening. The collar is not sewn down so it kindof flaps around. The collar itself makes it look like a bathrobe. Plus the fact that the pockets stick out like a bathrobe, instead of being sewn on the inside like most jackets and cardigans. The stitching on the right side of the lapel/collar is also bunched up instead of smooth like the other side. Theres loose threads everywhere.<br />Its sad because I want to love it but the poor quality of this just feels very bath robe ish to me. Im usually the picky one in my family, and my mom usually loves how everything looks on me and never has a bad thing to say about anything. I put it on and she said “ewe no! That looks like a robe!” and thats when I knew that I had to return this. If my mom of all people thinks it looks bad…then it must be."
2.0,The picture is much smaller on the actual shirt. It was a birthday gift but not giving it because it looks cheap.
2.0,"The hoodie, or shirt I should say, looks Nothing like the picture. Its a very thin shirt like hoodie, which does not resemble the picture at all, and the color of the hoodie in the picture is not even navy blue."
2.0,"These bras are not that great to large do not provide enough support,I wish I had sent them back."
2.0,lasted maybe 6 months. cracked on the side. won't buy again.
2.0,The material feels cheap and low quality. The construction of the dress is messy. It was not at all flattering when I put it on. I don't think it mattered that the size was incorrect. I was not interested in trying on a different size.
2.0,The shorts were adorable<br />The shirt was to big and the button fell off a few minutes after trying on so that was a bummer.
2.0,Not as I expected.  Want to return it
2.0,I ordered the adult size the costume was very tight on my 13 year old daughter and whenever she moved she couldn’t see because of a liner around the face. I would not recommend.
2.0,"Bought this necklace with the matching earrings.  The colors of the beads are dull and the clasp and<br />extender are cheap, cheap, cheap.  O.K. for a young tween or child but a big disappointment for an<br />adult.  No length or width dimensions were posted on the product and the beads look smaller in person.<br />Don't waste your money!"
2.0,Little disappointing/ not as nice as I had hoped<br />Had to create a new Xmas party outfit:(
2.0,Feels like very cheap quality. Works best for women with extreme features. Must have BOTH big hips and chest
2.0,"I gave an overall of 2 stars because this infinity scarf is too short.  I don't want a scarf that is too close to my neck.  If you get cold easily, you would probably like it.  It didn't lay where I wanted it to because the length was not long enough, so I returned them."
2.0,"[edited since conversation with seller and purchase of 26"" inseam compression pants which were also defective] The piece I received arrived with an unraveling front seam as my photographs show. I am returning the pants. Besides the quality control problems the pants seemed to fit well and they were comfortable. I ordered the 22” inseam in the hopes that I could avoid the excess length that I typically experience with leggings (i'm short) but while the length was above of my ankle without bunching as I had hoped, the leg openings are not cut small enough to fit my legs where I wanted them to rest causing the pants to have a loose look at the bottom. In terms of compression - these pants are much looser than I was expecting. Perhaps an XXS size would be adequately compressive but unfortunately they don’t offer a size smaller than XS. For reference I have 27” waist, 36” hips, ~24-25” inseam.<br /><br />The 26"" inseam compression pants, in comparison, were much more compressive than the 22"" inseam pants although they also arrived defective with a hole in the crotch seam. The 26"" appear to be a different design than the 22"" because the 26""'s waist element is incredibly small and inelastic. This makes it a struggle to get the waist over your hips without it feeling like you're going to pop stitches. Once I got the waist past my hips I found that the hips were too loose. This makes me wonder how someone whose hips are supposed to fit these pants properly would ever get past the waist without destroying the waist. The length of the 26"" was just slightly long for me but much like the hips, the ankle holes were loose. Returned.<br /><br />In terms of customer service - initially - Bubblelime appeared more interested in me helping them solve their quality control problems than they were interested in helping me with my defective/unsatisfactory purchases. Perhaps something was was lost in their rapid-fire text-message-like responses. After I pointed this out to them (and after my initial review was published) their tone seemed to change (not their writing style). They did seem to try to find a way to refund my purchase without my having to return the items, which is something I recall other sellers being able to do. But in the end they wanted me to contact Amazon customer service which I thought would be as big a hassle as returning the items and so return the items I did. I would like to increase my review from two to two and a half stars because of the effort they seemed to put in to remedy the defective purchases I made. But since they didn't find a way to make my experience better (or they wouldn't do the legwork) I can't quite justify rounding 2.5 stars to 3."
2.0,"One thing that is not noted in the description anywhere is the material of this hat. When I received it, it is wool or something. It's incredibly hot! I had originally purchased this for my baby to wear in Disney World, but when I received it I realized the material shown in the picture is not what I received and that he would be entirely too hot wearing it. I will be returning for this reason."
2.0,A little see-through
2.0,It doesn't reach my feet as expected
2.0,"I purchased two different prints for this specific items and one arrived with no issues to the garment, but this particular one arrive with two holes on the pant leg :-(  .  The fit however, on both pants are terrific!! For me that is crucial because I have found it very difficult to find  pajama pants that have a good length (being 5 foot 2 inches tall). Pajama sets are also difficult so I wind up just buying it separately. Not sure why the other pj pants I bought were fine and this one had holes. I did however read that another customer had the same issue, but I took a chance. Hoping these reviews can get to the attention of the distributor and can be fixed."
2.0,"The color is love, a muted pink shade.  The blouse fits fairly well except the sleeves rug short and the waist is large.  The size charts is off."
2.0,"When I first this wallet I never reviewed it.  That turned out to be a good thing.  The inside liner just broke after just 2 1/2 years.  It should have lasted longer, at least two more years.  So I would not buy it."
2.0,"I loved this. It was perfect. Then I washed it and it shrank so bad. I couldn’t wear it, so I returned it."
2.0,They will only fit if you have chicken legs.
2.0,"Looks like s good product, but the fit is WAY off."
2.0,The top is really nice but the V-cut is not centered correctly and made a bit larger than expected.
2.0,"This was a case of bait and switch. Last year I ordered a 7-piece set of COSMOS headbands and they have been great. Substantial. Stay put, Really great quality. Figuring I would get pretty much the same quality, I recently ordered a 12-piece assortment of COSMOS headbands of various colors. They are incredibly thin and flimsy and disappointing. Which tells me that the name &#34;COSMOS&#34; comes with no quality or construction guarantees. Buyer beware. Ugh."
2.0,"Came quickly, but poor quality - flimsy. Looks nothing like the picture... The cowl neckline and the bottom disappoint."
2.0,Unfortunately the skirt size I purchased was too tight (M- and I usually wear medium). Couldn’t sit down or walk without the buttons popping
2.0,"I bought these for a second time just to have some spares; unfortunately, as i went to open the silver hoop, the inner bar that clicks in popped out and was lost forever :/"
2.0,"I ordered this specifically for the slit leg design. The slit is located completely in the back.  No way for any skin exposure to happen.  The ruching of the fabric on the elastic waistband on the back is weird, creating a platform look... not sexy"
2.0,My chain broke the second time I wore it for no apparent reason - hope I can return it for an exchange or refund.
2.0,"The gray color is terrible, the fit was awful and I was super disappointed. Don't buy this!"
2.0,"I like the dress, order size L but it comes small fitting"
2.0,"Runs very very small! I'm a size woman's 20, I ordered 4XL, still small."
2.0,"I just returned this dress for a few reasons: 1. despite other reviewers saying that the dress is soft, I found it to be that itchy polyester feel. I DO have sensitive skin, so if you don't maybe the fabric will be just fine for you.  2.  Fabric is see-through, which i find disappointing bc I prefer to go braless.  3. There's these weird, seemingly random, non-functional but annoying seams on both sides of the chest.  They were not pictured in the photos from the manufacturer. That all being said, I like the cut of the dress, the color, and the pockets...Fits true to size.  I usually wear a S in dresses like these and this dress in S fit just right."
2.0,It doesn’t have numbers on the dial so was challenging for my 10 year old granddaughter to read adequately. Returned it
2.0,"The LED lights lasted no more than a month, the transparent protective strip around the shoe was poorly constructed and peeled away. We were forced to crazy glue it and the only reason I rated it with two stars instead of one is because it brought a great deal of joy to my son and he does enjoy wearing them."
2.0,"The ring and wedding set is beautiful, but a stone fell out of the engagement ring, making the set unattractive.  I actually paired the wedding ring with another engagement ring, so I kept the set.  So buyer beware."
2.0,"It’s a simple casual dress just NOT as described. Not stretchy, not very long, not loose fitting. I’m 5’8” tried this on without shoes and it was 6” off the ground. It’s cut straight down not loose at all."
2.0,"Good material & colors , but  too  long, hard to make cute."
2.0,"The pillow was comfortable, but was too small go to around the neck of anyone except for my 2 year old daughter. The hood also is fairly small and doesn't allow you to pull it over your eyes/face for privacy or darkness"
2.0,"I have owned two pairs of the aviator. They look awesome on. The first pair were purchased at Costco. I had to take them back two times when a lens fell out.  Then one day I  hung them on my shirt front while entering a grocery store. Upon exiting the store I  went to put them on but 1 lens was missing. I returned to the store but never found the lens.  Sometime later, I purchased another pair from Amazon. I have had to cope with a lens falling out more than three times.  There has to be a reason but who knows. I just keep reinstating the lens and tighten the little screw.  I am starting to lose patience."
2.0,"The skirt looks cute, although it does stick out as the material is quite stiff. The worst part is the crotch area is way too short and tight, unfortunately making this skirt very uncomfortable."
2.0,luck cheap
2.0,These pants were not fleece lined as advertised! Just a single thin layer of windbreaker type material. Hope I won’t freeze to death on my camping trip lol. They are very cheaply made with very sticky zippers that don’t want to open or close. They are quite long also. Suitable if you just want some cheap water-resistant pants but do not order these if you want any insulation or protection against the elements.
2.0,Bulker than picture and has very fake gold coloring
2.0,They unravel
2.0,To celebrate Juneteenth month
2.0,"I bought this as a gift, and overall it looks nice, but the face is a PRINTED WOODEN DESIGN. Not actual wood. I was really disappointed to see that. I don't know how it's held up, I'm just not thrilled with the face."
2.0,"My initial order came in the mail and was missing a component that connects the upper shoulder-strap to the lower, so the seller resent me another which was fine. My huge issue with this bag is the fact the material that meets the shoulder strap broke only after a month of use the and I don't carry much; I mainly use it as a gym bag.<br /><br />It's also small, after putting my flip-flops in the shoe compartment there's barely enough space for clothes and a towel. I wouldn't recommend this bag for short-term use, let alone long-term. I'm sure you may  find a better quality item on Amazon."
2.0,"So, this item looks great on the web site.  Supposedly has a retail price of $70 something or more.  When I got it, the box was very nice.  I was excited.  It looked more like polished copper than gold.  I was disappointed.  Nice gift for a young girl."
2.0,"Cheap quality. For the same price you can get better quality at Marshall's, To mass etc."
2.0,They are definitely on the tiny side.
2.0,"This looks a bit cheap, and mass manufactured. Its an everyday wear sport pin. No points for originality or quality.  The picture was far more impressive than the pin. The pin is a decent price, but if you want looks and price, Pewtermill Celtic Knotwork Cross Kilt Pin w/ Swarovoski Crystal is well priced, beautifully designed and worth the postage and extra couple week's wait, truly.  Not a bad pin, but a disappointing one. It is light, and much more artistic than 50 percent of the commercial pins under 50 bucks.  A nice pin for one on a budget, or for daily use. It is attractive, but no OH factor."
2.0,"It's too baggy and unflattering, especially with the higher waist and too-stretchy material. I will be returning for a smaller size, and will be determining if it's worth it then."
2.0,Didn't fit will need to return
2.0,"The lenses work just as promised, however the frames are VERY cheaply made.  They are not spring hinged. I got two pair and the two months after they arrived the first pair have broken at the hinge."
2.0,Runs small will have to give them away soon.
2.0,"The product arrived on time and in good condition. This bracelet is very cheap looking. It wasn’t worth the trouble to return it, so I kept it. I wouldn’t recommend this product."
2.0,The area that is supposed to be while or off white looks very pink.
2.0,Second time buying.  First ones where perfect. Size stretch and thickness all good. Then I purchased 2 more. They are terrible.  Way bigger the mask wont even stay on my face the ear loops are1and a half inchs bigger. The material is thin. I paid a little extra cause i thought it was good quality guess I was wrong. And they don't come in different sizes.
2.0,"Not the same sweater pictured on line.  Busy with the holiday, missed my window to send it back.  My fault but still upset."
2.0,Not really what I was expecting.
2.0,"Good product. Purchased once b4. This time they sent me the wrong color, and I have to pay for their screw up?"
2.0,"I was really disappointed when I pulled the dress out of its packaging. The idea and design really appealed to me, but the quality of construction is really poor. Chiffon fabrics are difficult to work with: I get it. BUT the amount of messed up stitching on the outside of the kaftan is insane: little pile ups and knots of thread all up and down the edges of the dress: neckline, hem, and sides. There were also multiple snags in the fabric. Returning it."
2.0,Seperated from sole second time I wore them.
2.0,"Looks like decent material, but the color is all wrong. The belt itself is more of a burnt orange color and the leather loops and stitching under the post is a grey-brown color. They look very mismatched (orange/brown and gray/brown just don't work together). I was looking for real brown and returned the belt."
2.0,"I bought these because they were cheaper than the Calloway Scorecard Readers that I had left at some restaurant.  And that's what I got -- cheap construction, temples that bent when you extend them and a constant need to adjust their position my face.  So now I have Calloways again"
2.0,If you are looking for the animal print items to match then you  should not buy this set. The hat does not match any of the other items.  The earrings dont match any of the other items and they are paper thin.  The bracelet is ok too bad it doesn't match any of the items.<br />I would not recommend this set due to the mismatched animal prints.<br />I gave it a 2 because the necklace looks good. IT JUST DOESNT MATCH ANY OF THE ITEMS IN THE SET.
2.0,"Super super cute, not true to size at all. Ordered 2 sizes bigger as the reviews have stated. I ordered an 2xl and it ended up my friend Who is a medium. I am normally an L. Really disappointed because it is super cute. At least my bestie loves it!"
2.0,"Fit great, very stretchy, yet became unsewn in the back while wearing!!!!!"
2.0,A bit disappointed. Super cute but damaged :(
2.0,"I received them but look prettier online, and they were too big, had to give them out kept one for myself."
2.0,colors not as shown on the internet.  cannot use but cost more to send back than just to trash
2.0,These don’t stay up. The colors don’t look good. The weaving leaves strings inside that catch on my toes.
2.0,I did not care for the material on this sweater.  I returned it immediately!  It did not look like the material in the picture to me.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Looks like and made of plastic. Wasnt happy with my purchase. Disappointing because it looks so cute in the picture....pass.
2.0,Very comfortable.....just the sizing is off. I ordered a 3Xl and it fits like an extra large.
2.0,"Design looks great; but the clips that attach it to your glasses literally broke right as I tightened it down the first time: I’m going to see if I can find some extra bands online . Just disappointed, I was looking forward to wearing this/ ended up ordering a different set from someone else"
2.0,Still no size chart. After reading reviews I ordered size medium expecting a size 5-6. A kids size 10-12 came instead.
2.0,"i returned this dress, the pattern was not as expected"
2.0,As expected for the price. Didn’t fit young teen boy tho. Definitely adult sized glasses.
2.0,Ran slightly small and ripped after first wash.
2.0,"WARNING NOT for women with larger breasts. I ordered a large from looking at the reviews but when I tried the top on, it was WAY too small! It was so small that I don’t even think an XL would fit. I’m 5’8” 150lbs. I already knew the bottoms probably would not fit which I was okay with, but I’m very disappointed with the top. The design is cute but I’m definitely sending this bathing suit back."
2.0,fabric is soft but too tight and it shows all body's Problems
2.0,It doesn't have a real buckle. It just has posts that stick into holes in the belt. As soon as those holes become slightly larger from use the buckle will no longer stay fastened.
2.0,It will clean your hat if you have a dishwasher or a top loading washer. If your bill is curved then good luck keeping your hat inside this thing. Don't wash in hot water. It will ruin your hat.
2.0,The bow tie came unstiched with only one hour of wear. Pretty disappointed. Suspenders were fine.
2.0,"Update:<br /><br />I'm not happy because the buckle looks different from their photos. It's aggressively distressed, when the photos show a smooth, glossy look.<br /><br />To be clear for new buyers. you may like the buckle if you like what is in my photos. If you are expecting it to look like their photos, it won't.<br /><br />Personally, I'm amazed at the reviews on here. Strange how many of them are so very happy about a so-so belt."
2.0,The logo and trim look gold....its orange. It's a great hoodie but just letting yall know the trim and logo are not gold on the actual product.
2.0,These do not stay in place and not comfortable
2.0,"For some reason, it’s picky. I didn’t expect that since it’s just a cotton/poly blend. I’ll be sending it back. :-("
2.0,"My first wear the pocket seam split open and I haven't worn it since. It seems cheaply made. The length is to the knee as seen in the picture which was an oversight on my part, it is just too long. Does not lay right when wearing. Pretty , Item as described, that is why 2 stars. It's a shame because this would of been a nice casual beach/vacation piece."
2.0,"Came from China. Wore well, didn't slip from my polyester work shirt. Actually did a good job. Went to adjust one of the clips to another spot on the shirt today and when I opened the clasp it violently sprung apart... can get it back together, but it just comes back apart. Poorly made, bad QC."
2.0,"2 stars cause it's cute. Not more because I almost lost my keys a few times,  and the last time one of the balls came out and the key chain is now trash."
2.0,Ordered a small the tee is more like a mens xl or xxl. It’s huge. The graphic is so cute. Really bummed on the sizing.
2.0,"watch was cute and my son is a huge Super Mario fan, but after just ONE DAY  of wear the paint was melting off and staining his skin."
2.0,Received in time. My kid likes it.
2.0,Water can get inside
2.0,Nice wallet for<br />2<br />Credit card2
2.0,"I checked the size chart and ordered accordingly, but the pants came extremely small. They’re child size. The quality looks good though."
2.0,I wasn't that impressed with this print... it just isn't what i was expecting. Not necessarily as pictured... the material is not as flowy.
2.0,"The fabric is ok, not as soft as I expected. The only problem is the neck line. Somehow, the one I got as a gift, the neckline was not a V-neck at all. It was the opposite.  The neckline is so high that is super uncomfortable.  I won't be able to wear the top, just the pants."
2.0,They look nice but only wore them one day and they were extremely uncomfortable.  The heel was already wearing down.
2.0,"The ring itself is beautiful. However I have sensitive skin and I can only wear certain metals. It gave me a bad allergic reaction. Also, it's a very big ring. It looks like costume jewelry rather than an everyday piece of jewelry."
2.0,The mood stone is poorly attached so the colors are not changing completely
2.0,I gave this as a gift for Christmas.  It has already fallen apart!  The chain broke almost instantly we replaced the chain for only a stone to fall out a few days later.  It was very pretty but did not last.
2.0,I can't really recommend this jacket.  It is super thin and doesn't really do a good job of blocking wind or rain.  I also think this may be a women's jacket given the location of the zipper.  There are better alternatives out there.
2.0,"Of course it has the same style (sort of) as pictured but the color of the one pictured is much darker than the one you receive. Fits just like my other crewnecks but not a fan of how light it is compared to the one pictured. Go to the store and find one that looks better than this one, waste of 20 dollars."
2.0,"If this would have been stretchy, soft and comfortable I probably would have kept.  I usually wear XL.  This was far too small.  If there would have been a XXL available, I would've gotten that, and probably been happy with it"
2.0,"color is dull, not like picture"
2.0,"So hard to buy jewelry online, these weren't the worst earrings but just not for me. I returned."
2.0,"They scratched up within a few weeks of wear, even using a sunglass holder.  Too bad!"
2.0,"Disappointed. Purchased for a trip to the Grand Canyon in March, wanted a lightweight, vegan jacket that could pack well but also keep me warm. Did not keep me warm despite layering underneath. Jacket description says that jacket packs into pocket. It does not for me, only fits about two thirds of the way in. Jacket fabric pulls easily and overall jacket does not breathe well. I have now been wearing this when biking in in 35-40 degree weather, arrive at destination sopping wet. Can't win either way with this jacket. Total waste of money."
2.0,I'm petite.  the width is fine.  Not all petites are skinny as all get out.  Many of us are under 5 feet and under 130 lbs.  I took your product to the cleaners to be altered. As usual.  The product wears very comfortable.  Broke my knee over 3 months ago... great product when wearing a knee brace. HA! HA! recommend.
2.0,Literally broke in like 3 weeks don't buy
2.0,The heel of the stockings kept slipping down under my heel and crept to my toes. Thickness is perfect but the design of the top part needs work.
2.0,"The skirt is as vivid as the pictures and the fit is okay, maybe a bit big. I really wanted to love it. However, as soon as I put my hands in the pockets the seams split. It'd cost me over a third of the price of the skirt to return it, so I will probably keep it. Definitely won't be buying from this seller again though."
2.0,Looks a bit cheap... Finishing is poor and the lens gets me headache because of the reflect.
2.0,"Zipper is bright gold color, looks cheap, and doesn't zip easily."
2.0,"I liked the shirt, however, here’s a picture of the “orange” shirt which I ordered. I will be sending it back and re-ordering an actual orange shirt.<br /> Other than the wrong color, the shirt seems comfortable and fits well."
2.0,Just BAD!!
2.0,"The ""drawstring"" on this sweater is not an actual functional drawstring, which is a disappointment.  Beyond that, it's an oversize, boxy fit that pars well with most pants, particularly leggings.  I am a size 12 and the Large is  a bit too large; I'd consider sizing down."
2.0,Not as cute in person as in the photo.
2.0,Too big and not stylish at all.  There are better reader sunglasses!  I just picked up a pair at CVS for $15 that are really cute.
2.0,"Really disappointed in this headband. I ordered it for my six-year-old, who is wearing a Pocahontas  costume for Halloween. The headband is so small it doesn't even fit my three-year-old."
2.0,"I loved these boots -- LOVED them. I had to buy a second pair I loved them so much -- and then, SO SADLY, they fell apart in LESS THAN A YEAR! Beware! They are AMAZING....for a few months. :("
2.0,Fit well but I don't like the shinny fabric.
2.0,Pretty sure this isn't sterling silver. I bought for my girlfriend and she breaks out from jewelry if it isn't silver or gold. And this necklace gave her a rash so some false advertisement if I say so.
2.0,"These are not made for men.  Small women, maybe.  But not men.  They are also very flimsy.  The neck-warmer is nice, though."
2.0,"Super cute and exactly what I was looking for. But the fabric is extremely itchy! I took the chance, removed the tag and washed it. Unfortunately, it remained itchy. It’s to a point that I can not keep the article on. I do not have sensitive skin and surprised by the reaction."
2.0,"If you are buying this hat to protect your head from the sun, you shoukd know that the back of the hat is plastic mesh. Not only defeating the purpose, but also uncomfortable if you have a bald head."
2.0,"These skirts were cute. However, they may show a little too much. They were a little too thin."
2.0,Nice enough but too large for me
2.0,"This necklace is quite light and flimsy.  It looks and feels cheap.  I wouldn’t have minded purchasing it for a lower price, but don’t think it’s worth the almost ten dollar price.  It feels more like something you’d find at a dollar store."
2.0,Product is amazing except it's too big:(
2.0,"I love the way they feel-But I don't like the fact that they shed-all the time you If you walk on a rug r throw rugs. Fuzz gets on the Rugs, I have to vacuum the fuzz up. It sticks to rugs. It really doesn't matter how good they feel-it's not worth it"
2.0,"The drawstrings are in a weird place and doesn't look flattering. The material is nice, and it's very stretchy."
2.0,The material is not very nice like as shown in the picrure. The dress look very cheap made and not measure right.  Do not recommended.
2.0,Product only fits wire framed glasses.
2.0,Not as pictured.  Thin t-shirt material that flares out at the side on the bottom.
2.0,They don't glow in the dark as advertised and they are very very thin silicon.
2.0,"I was hoping this wig will fit, but it is just too small, and I have a small head!"
2.0,Love the idea of these googles but they just don’t stay tight. They repeatedly loosen or stretch during swim lessons until they are pulling on her ears. Cute. Nice material. Looks and feels well crafted. Not the life and hair saver I thought they would be.
2.0,"I bought this necklace for my glasses. I have arthritis and even if I didn’t, the slide is very difficult to move up and down. For $40.00, I expected much better. I’m seriously considering returning. It is nice looking though."
2.0,I like the fit of the skirt. The material is thin but not bad. But there are four discolored areas of the skirt as if the skirt were made from cut down jeans. These discolored areas are not shown in the picture. I wonder if others had the same experience or if this was a dud.
2.0,The blue dress is see thru and shorter than advertised.
2.0,No fur or sheepskin unless you urn the fingers inside out. there you will find less than 1/2 inch thin patch of &#34;something&#34;. I was disappointed.
2.0,It’s looks different from the picture.
2.0,"Sizing is NOT accurate on these, these are 2-3 sizes too small, despite getting accurate measurements of my daughter's foot."
2.0,Cute but glitter everywhere. Returned.
2.0,"It is okay so far. I like the silhouette of the sweater when it is on. I purchased in black so the cable definition doesn’t stand out as much as in a lighter color would. That being said, the cables still look very flat which gives it a cheaper look. I don’t know if they will puff up any when washed.<br /><br />I just received it and will update if my opinion changes."
2.0,Still to small and thin
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:2b0c2dedd3de2a454a7da455ea9f36a3]] This VALAV Women's Sweater is an oversized Mock Turtleneck. I love the color of the sweater, but I do not like the way the mock Turtleneck fits at all. It’s too wide for an average size neck and it hits in a weird spot on my neck (see my video for a detailed demonstration). Most mock Turtleneck sweaters are fitted so there is no space between your skin and the sweater, but this leaves a large gap and just fits totally awkward. This is true to fit, but I would not recommend this to others."
2.0,Would be cute for a cheapo bracelet but one of the strings broke as soon as I put it on.
2.0,Appears to run on the small size. Poor fabric quality.
2.0,"Ok, so I LOVE how this watch looks. I wanted a digital watch that was professional enough for work. Ive had this for barely 24 hours and the light button already stopped working. I've been super careful about keeping it away from water so am pretty disappointed that it's already breaking. 😕"
2.0,For a woman who doesn't have a big face this is entirely too big. Even with the strap keeping it tight I cannot get it to stay on for the life of me. I am a server and need a mask more than anything. It seems like good quality. If you have a small face I would reccomend not buying these.
2.0,"With thick in the title, I expected these to be on the thicker side, but they are actually rather thin. The slip down frequently as well and I don't like them as much as my other leggings from this brand."
2.0,My son is currently size 6.5 and I bought the 7/8 so he would be able to have some wiggle room to grow into - they are tight. His toe is right up against the fabric.<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of the heel.  The heel of the slippers covers half his heel and then there's the flap of the slippers that covers the rest of the heel. I feel like it isn't going to stay on correctly.<br /><br />Not sure if I will return or exchange.  But he really likes the bright colors and I like the thickness of the soles
2.0,It’s small citrine..
2.0,"I was skeptic about purchasing this swimsuit at first because there were no reviews but I bought it anyway and here's what I think: the material feels and looks great, just like the picture. However, I ordered a large because my behind is fairly big and it looks more like a small. It might as well as been a thong. The top fit great so if I were to go up in size then the top would no longer fit me. It's sad because I really liked the print."
2.0,returned it not very cute in person
2.0,Way to big can’t wear
2.0,This is see through and very thin… not a quality hoodie. Poor value
2.0,"The Bag is well thought out, but not durable.  For a brand that promotes the integrity of their zippers for security, the internal zipper failed after little use.  I contacted Travelon in accordance with their warranty process, but they would not stand behind the zipper defect.  They said it was out of warranty and as such the manufacturing defect was not warrantable.  Travelon gave me the great opportunity to purchase a replacement item on their site, and IF I ASKED they would give me an undisclosed discount on the purchase, BUT I HAD TO ASK.  How ridiculous is this type of warranty support?  I decided to purchase another brand that hopefully will be more durable and be made by a company that stands behind their products."
2.0,The color was vibrant.  It appeared to have fit as expected but I never placed it on my head. The smell was awful even after being washed twice I could not tolerate the odor and dare not place it on my person..  I tossed it into the trash.
2.0,The material is too thin and flimsy. I was disappointed with the way it draped.
2.0,I purchased 2 pair for my 4yr old twin boys to use in my backyard. My yard has Mulch and they were going from the pool to the trampoline. The entire sole came away from one shoe on 1st day. A 2nd shoe also started coming apart. I sat almost 20mins popping it back into place. Just so it would start falling apart again on the 2nd wear. Save your time spend the extra $10 on the real thing.
2.0,"Is was cheeper, a lot and could uses any more, the color changed!"
2.0,Material isn't great. I recommend the sidefeel version of this dress over this one.
2.0,"I had to send these earrings back for a refund. They were more generous than I thought they would be. For me they are too long and a little too wide. I have a long neck, still they were too long."
2.0,it’s just a very weird feel for a shirt uncomfortable to me but cute
2.0,"It was broken when it arrived, returned."
2.0,This would have been the perfect everyday purse if only it was a medium or large bag!!! Lot's of compartments and details. If only it was bigger. I would definitely purchase if it was found in a bigger size!
2.0,Have owned for nearly a year and use daily. I have to take out my ID multiple times a day.<br />Pros:<br />-leather is nice and durable<br />-firs in front pocket easily<br />-ID card pocket on outside is nice<br /><br />Cons<br />- money clip is pretty worthless if you’re carrying for than 3 singles<br />- the three pockets together make it nearly impossible to get anything in the middle pocket<br /><br />Will probably try something else when this wears out
2.0,by the time this arrives the baby will be diffetent size...hurry up
2.0,You need to be very thin to wear this belt.  But at the price I paid I guess it should be expected.
2.0,"The dress is just cut weird. You can barely see in my photo the extra black fabric. As many reviews have stated, the top piece of fabric is just too long. It looks super odd. I really wanted to like this dress, but it was returned."
2.0,Fit was terrible. Wrong in all the right places.
2.0,If your short like It worth it it better long legs fit me really big and I look even Short and I’m only 5 foot
2.0,"It is supposed to be sterling silver but it isn't, it is only plated and after only two months of wear the plating is coming off. I am allergic to any metal that is not real so I cannot wear the ring anymore."
2.0,"I'm 5'3 and 110 lbs. I am small but curvy.  This fit me throughout the body (it could be more snug since it stretches) but the entire sleeve and knee through ankle is very loose and unflattering on me. The sleeve is also sewn twisted at the armhole so you can see the folds at the front and back armhole. I'm satisfied with it for the price but I will have to take it to the tailor to adjust the sleeve and the leg opening. Overall it runs big and I would most likely be an extra small but they don't have that size. I plan to wear it zipped all the way up to the neck edge but it is very tight and feels chokey when zipped all the way up. It definitely doesn't fit like it is shown in the picture.  Even if it did, I think it would still be big."
2.0,Very low quality. Not made for outdoors.
2.0,"Fits a little loose at the toes and one side was a little looser than the other but I kept them because they were cute.  After having them less than a month, the soles are separating from the wedge part of the shoe."
2.0,The hat is of low quality and strands are coming out.
2.0,I LOVED the charms but the bracelet wasn’t strong like my Pandora bangle so I moved the charms to my real Pandora. Very cute but bracelet didn’t hold up:(
2.0,"The color and material is smooth, which my daughter likes.  It was way too small and we gave them to a much younger girl."
2.0,"As soon I opened the package, I could see that the letters (which aren’t even pictured) were starting to peel off. Not worth the money!"
2.0,Looks nice but had scratches on it. I was very disappointed!
2.0,Comfortable but stitching around waistband is coming undone after 2 wearing.
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture...hair falls to the ground...should have returned it.
2.0,I am so disappointed in the DISNEY LINE the pants faded terribly the first time washed in Cold water. The sticker on the shirt came off the first time in the wash in Cold water. And Hung up to dry. Its a shame when you can’t count on the companies you Used to be able to count on for Quality merchandise. For as much as I paid for this outfit I expected a lot more. And it had an official Disney Tag on the outfit.
2.0,Nice shape and nice looking but the lenses are way too dark.<br />I don't mind dark ones but these are so dark I can only use them in the bright sunlight. I<br />I like to wear my sunglasses anytime I'm outside or even inside in the summer as long as the suns out even if it's just partially out but I can't do that with these cause their so dark.
2.0,"Cool shirt first time u wear it, then u wash it and the logo comes off. Like they bought a shirt and a sticker and then sold u the “product” sigh…. It sucks big time. Trash can. Waste of $"
2.0,These would not stay on our glasses.
2.0,Some of them broken.. they are cute but extremelly cheap quality
2.0,"The picture of these earrings looked lovely, and the reviews seemed pretty good, so I went ahead and ordered them to wear to a wedding.  The earring back is a lever style and is placed in such an odd location that it is highly prominent even when wearing the jewelry, and detracts from the look.  If the back was different, I *might* consider keeping them, but it just wasn't as sophisticated of a look as I had hoped based on the picture; I sort of felt like a kid playing dress up in that plastic play jewelry from the kid's toy aisle...."
2.0,"They look like the picture in person but the inside of the boot seemed to begin to kind of disintegrate after  just minutes of wearing. I thought it was weird they came in the box folded up, I have never bought a pair of cowboy boys that were like that. They also had no cushion but you get what you pay for. I returned them and got my money back."
2.0,"I bought this bow tie for my son’s first birthday pictures. First of all, the straps are too long to fit around his neck. It looked ridiculous so I ended up having to loosely tie it and tuck the straps. The Velcro is not sewen on far enough back, IMO. Secondly, the straps were sewen on backwards so the anchor pattern was on the inside of the bow tie. I ended up trying to twist it through the back, which fixed the problem enough for pictures. Thirdly, the Velcro started coming away from the straps after the first time he wore it. It’s strong Velcro, and ended up pulling the stitches out on both sides. Not very good quality, but served its purpose in the end."
2.0,broke super quickly
2.0,Hate the material. Would not have bought if I found it in a store.
2.0,"If you are a thicker girl, it will bring out EVERYTHING. Head my warning."
2.0,These were the most uncomfortable shoes; they felt like cardboard.
2.0,"I'm returning this item. It was very unattractive on me and the only sign I had curves is when the ""shorts"" went up my bum. I don't recommend purchasing unless you have a flat butt and huge breasts to counteract the top's boxy nature."
2.0,Had these on for two hours and the feather came apart.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Wasn't for my body type.
2.0,Good looking watch with a lot of features. Digital time is good but the analog operation not accurate. But I wasn't expecting a Rolex for $20.xx
2.0,"I got the gray, and should have read the reviews....the gray is so dark it’s almost black.  The lettering is barely visible and very disappointing!"
2.0,Eeh just left me thinking...I should have spent more on a better glove.
2.0,"The graphics are absolutely amazing, unfortunately, the quality of the material is poor. It might be fine for beginners or people who don't train much, but for those of us who train 3+ days per week, the material simply does not hold up."
2.0,"I like it, but it was broken when i got it, had to have it repaired."
2.0,Ugly dress.....
2.0,These do not offer  very much compressio. t I gave to a man who uses to help keep knee area warm.
2.0,idk what these legging are made out of but when i put them on they made my legs itch like crazy. i tried everything to make them stop itching it lasted for like an hour it was horrible i could not stop itching them.
2.0,"I bought this 3pack, came with one shirt in a fancy bag. Shirts nice and fit good but not if I paid for three so I got a refund from Amazon. Be careful"
2.0,"Cheap material super thin, strings hanging out every where"
2.0,One earing was more secure and there were defects such as scratches and gouges in the product
2.0,The description says one 2 pack but I only got one brick.
2.0,Split in two after 1.5 months of it being in my watch.
2.0,"Cute, but clasp is very large and clunky"
2.0,Not at all what I thought it was.  I somehow thought I was buying a PrAna product as this product appeared in my search.  These shorts are no where near the quality and comfort of the PrAna shorts that I have worn for years.  These shorts will likely go in the Goodwill box without ever being worn
2.0,"Beautiful piece and concept, but it arrived with a defect on the back surface of the resin...."
2.0,"Not sweater material, runs super small"
2.0,The button came off and sadly can’t find it I was hopping to wear it soon I feel like I waisted money on a dress that the button popped right off now need to find but the dress fits nice but need to find a way to sew the button back on the dress
2.0,Watch Runs very fast.  Gains over five minutes a day
2.0,"My son wears a medium jacket, I ordered a large to make sure he had some room.  It fits very snug, we are sending back for an x-large."
2.0,Product fit great and definitely cute. However the fabric is awful. It feels like 70's polyester and I ended up with a rash on my skin after wearing it. It is going in the giveaway pile.
2.0,So small even ordered 2 sizes bigger daughter had to wear as a tunic
2.0,Was cute but then was ruined after one cycle through the wash machine. Sad.
2.0,Way to small and not comfy to wear at all. Returned.
2.0,"Runs a bit large, did not fit. Size down 1/2 size."
2.0,This mask is HUGE!! Bought for my daughter and it’s big on me even!!! Not kids size. Very annoyed and disappointed as my daughter hoped to have this for the first day of school
2.0,These are not compression tops! They are stretch tops. Great colors but I need compression on a surgical site. The search continues…
2.0,This was the only pair I ordered that I was not overly fond of.  Picture looked better than original.
2.0,Broke like my second week having it
2.0,"They are very cute, but run too big. I like a big of room but this is too loose.  If they fit better i would scored higher."
2.0,Kind of cheap looking.  I think the spur would scratch the lining of my handbag.  I would not order again.
2.0,Look nice but came with one missing
2.0,Print was cute but fit was very strange. Both sides have lots of extra fabric under my arms. (See photo.)
2.0,Was a bit too small
2.0,Headlights  Batteries Charger
2.0,"So I gave this 2 stars because the “bracelet” is HUGE, like huge and fit up to my bicep. I ended up taking off the charms and using them in my Zelda wig as decorations. The charms are super cute though."
2.0,"The headlamp works fine, field of light is a little narrow relative to other headlamps I've owned, but the three band headgear (around and over the head) keeps it quite still. The red LED clip lights are basically useless. Both that I have switch themselves off with any amount of jostling, which means I am constantly fighting with them during runs to keep them going. It took a few runs to figure out it was the lights and not me that was the problem, so my return window closed or I would have sent everything back. Would not recommend."
2.0,Not worth it. Mine came with yellow and black spots where they shouldn't be. Disappointed.
2.0,Nice but very cheaply made. Very light fabric and a little over priced for the quality.
2.0,Not what I thought it would be for $32.00.
2.0,I have worn it on 2 different fingers and both fingers have turned green.
2.0,"The watch band was easily put onto my watch, however getting it onto my wrist....IMPOSSIBLE!~  if you live alone, do not buy, I had to have my adult daughter put it on my wrist, it is impossible to place on yourself.  Then after a few days the darn thing broke.  The clasp.  It was really pretty, a total PIA and then broke.  I'm disappointed because I liked how it looked."
2.0,I do not recommend these to people who have very sensitive ears.
2.0,Unsure that the gauge size is correct. Seems MUCH thicker than described.
2.0,Looked a lot smaller in the picture. It was way too big. 😏
2.0,"I absolutely loved this sweater however not even a month after wearing it holes started popping up every where. I patched up a few but it was too hard to keep up. I am seriously disappointed, I am in love with this sweater but had to throw mine away"
2.0,too tiny an opening
2.0,"The ring is prettyand the fit is fine. However, it is too gaudy for me. I would have liked it if the stones were smaller."
2.0,"The sock is nice and thin; comfortable, but the elastic around ankle is tight for me and seems to be cutting off circulation, and leaves a mark."
2.0,They don’t look much like the picture. Laces are elastic and are way too long for the shoe.
2.0,"Tshirt is very fitted and stretchy material, not a loose oversized tee as depicted.  Not happy with my purchase which I ordered for a concert in two days."
2.0,"The top is very cute and flowy but the bottom just doesn’t make sense. Your top is very well covered but the bottoms barely covered, just seems a bit mismatched style wise."
2.0,"I suppose I went out on a limb with this order. The open back is just a little too fashion forward for our utilitarian needs. I was looking for swimsuit that would protect my preteen from the intense sweltering sun that beats down of her shoulders during surf camp. I do not think my daughter (approx 5’ 108 lbs) will ultimately grab for this suit when summer comes and it’s time to catch some waves.  Actually, my wife even tried it on because it really was not at all a good fit for my daughter (thinking maybe it’s just too big)…well, it looked atrocious on my wife! The arms would have been excellent and she loved everything about the suit until she put it on and it may her feel self conscious and exposed. I honestly think the cut is just really odd…i do not think there are many people with a shape that would be complimented by this swimsuit."
2.0,Hard to remove. fell apart after in week.
2.0,"This is a pretty slick looking watch. The leather is pretty durable in feel. The double languages for the days of the week takes a bit to get used to for those with similar watches.<br />The biggest issue I have is in the timekeeping of this watch. It may seem odd, but the watch I received doesn't keep accurate time! Mine lost about 5 minutes everyday before I returned it. This might just be a small defect, but just something to note when looking at this timekeeper."
2.0,It was a pretty color and fabric but it was too small.
2.0,came complety flattened
2.0,"This hat was a long tube of a hat, not the least bit slouchy as pictured. I cut it off to make a shorter toboggan that fit much better. It was well made and I like the color."
2.0,"Maybe you need to order a size up? The drape of this is very stiff and the silhouette just looks chunky, not flowing."
2.0,I bought three different dresses from this brand had to return all! Dresses look frumpy and unattractive when receiving tried in they were not flattering . Won’t be buying here again. It may work for you but not for me.
2.0,"Nice in theory, poor in execution.  I was made in China dooped.  I looked at this product for a really long time and finally bought it.  The top part didn't lay down and kept flapping up.  Then the rest just made me look like a box.  I returned it right away."
2.0,Tenía otra idea a lo q fue nada que ver con la foto es un hilito de anillo en la foto es mas ancho
2.0,"Way too basic!! Needs more slots, spot for license. I didn't like the leather feel. There are nicer, better wallets on Amazon for less money. I returned it and got a different one for my son."
2.0,It started chipping within a month. The black paint comes off if you wear it often.
2.0,Ultimately the zipper was too short and made it difficult to get on and off which would've been impossible when wet and the cut was unflattering to my body plus I really prefer the ones with shorts so I returned it and shelled out a few more bucks for a better product
2.0,"Nice color, but hard to clip and stay on wirst ,had to return it."
2.0,I really loved this ring until it started to tarnish after a couple weeks :(
2.0,"This is for a very short person. I would say a child but the top would be really inappropriate for a kid. The material is very cheap and oddly plastic. Does not look like picture, even the color is a weird bright blue."
2.0,I was really sad when these showed up with the earring posts bent and unwearable. I had ordered these after ordering the beautiful red coral ones because the coral earrings were perfect. Well made and pretty. Too bad these ones weren't.
2.0,"I've been wearing these for a while (maybe a couple months?) and they're turning green. Surgical steel doesn't turn green.  They are also too big to wear in my tragus really. Unless your ears are huge, don't wear them there."
2.0,I was so excited to get this shirt only to find that It is not very fitted. It is very wide almost like a mans shirt would fit.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I’m returning this set. The top is stiff with very little stretch. I appreciate structured clothing, but when I’m sleeping I don’t like to feel restricted. Also I don’t know how this top would accommodate a growing belly. The pants are a completely different story. The feel of the fabric alone was a huge turn off. Not breathable very cheap feeling. The pants looked like a completely different size than the top. Top looked small for a large more like a medium and the bottoms looked like an extra large. The quality is not worth the price tag. You’re better off looking at Walmart or Target. I did find some great pj’s on Amazon from the brand WiWi. Pre-pregnancy 170 lbs, 8 months in I’m 192 lbs I’m 5’9”"
2.0,the item is not as shown in the picture. the necklaces are almost all the same length
2.0,Cheap cloth material
2.0,This sweater was a really nice color and material but was ill fitting. I ordered the extra small as I usually wear a size 0 or similar. It's really large on top and fitted towards the waist. Not flattering at all. I'm returning it and am pretty bummed because it would have been a great deal for that price.
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for. Didn't pay much for these and it definitely shows in the delivered product.
2.0,"I was excited about this because it was cute and would be safer out in the streets on Halloween. Fit well and looked great, but within a few blocks of trick or treating, the lights on the left side went dark. Halfway through the night, the rest went dark. Very sad and a waste of money. Two stars only because it was great for the short time it worked."
2.0,The ring joint for one of it was bent and didn't use it at all
2.0,"I love the look of this poncho, it’s true to the picture, but I can’t get past how itchy the fabric is. Took a long time to arrive, so I didn’t bother sending back. Plus I thought washing it might soften it up...didn’t work unfortunately. Too bad, I really like it otherwise."
2.0,"I was attracted to these gloves because they are biodegradable. I bought the small size (the smallest size available) and they are very big, like a medium-large compared to other brands I've used."
2.0,"I didn’t have high expectations for this bodysuit, but I went ahead and purchased it anyways. Sadly I was right, but I guess you do get what you payed for. First of all the body suit was too short for my body so it didn’t even snap. I would get a bigger size but then the rest of it would have been a bit too loose. Second, the material is very, very, thick and cheap. I’m giving it two stars because it’s not completely unwearable but it wasn’t worth the money for me."
2.0,"Pants seem nice enough but didn't get a chance to try them out since the first time I put them on the zipper broke.  Its a tiny, little nylon zipper that don't belong on an article of clothing that's made for outdoor activities. If not for the zipper I think the pants would be great."
2.0,Too cheaply made for the price I paid!
2.0,"Didn't fit correctly; was baggy in some places and tight in others. Material was also not great, kind of itchy. I bought this to lounge in, not necessarily wear out. Reminds me of a $1 tshirt from a flea market. It's being returned."
2.0,"(1) fit is too short in the crotch (not enough room in the back), and (2) does not dry overnight"
2.0,Too hard and stiff returned.
2.0,The hole isn’t far enough along the sleeve. It hurts when you wear it because it’s tight in the crook of the thumb and pointer finger. Sleeve needs to be longer. And I’m 4’11 and I had a problem.
2.0,"The shirt fit well and I received lots of compliments;however, it was made poorly.  The left underarm stitching came undone within 3 hours of wear; it's fixable but I'm disappointed because I am not a fan of paying for something, only to end up doing work."
2.0,It was support to be for a 3 month baby but it is for 1 year old baby.
2.0,T-shirt was huge and logo was low quality- looked pixelated and was scratchy and hard. Returning and you have to pay a return shipping fee.
2.0,"Maybe it's just my body shape as I wear a medium and not a small like the model, but it looked nothing like how it does on the picture and was not flattering at all."
2.0,Don't order from this company. Too small and cheap.
2.0,"I don't think this is actually gold. Maybe they're silver.  2 stars because they still look nice, but I wouldn't buy again, especially not at gold prices."
2.0,I like the softness however the pants image was a fit tight workout pants not a boot cut.
2.0,Shrank two sizes after washing in cold water and spun dry at low heat. Straight to Goodwill.
2.0,There’s a dime sized black stain inside the hat.
2.0,the gloves came on time but I don't like the appearance it looks like they were spray paint or painted on.
2.0,It looks/fits nothing like pictured. Very wide like a shrunk T-shirt. The material is thin an rough (cheap)
2.0,"It fit fine, but the lace and edging is itchy and the material dies not breathe at all. Very uncomfortable."
2.0,"Fit extremely small, kept rolling up on itself. I couldn't wear it for more than 20 minutes at a time."
2.0,Not the coloring I was expecting.  Necklace was right length.  I was hoping this was more a off white color.  Will give this as a gift.
2.0,"If you have the option for a custom measurement..opt for the zipper. The lacing is a bummer! Also, if you are under 5""4, you will need to get the length altered. It runs fairly long. Great value and well made."
2.0,"I ordered the embroidered maxi black in size Large. According to their (the seller's) size chart the chest meassurement was 44.88&#34; To be on the safe side I ordered the large even though my bra size is 38B. But when I tried the garment on there was a 6&#34; gap between the two front panels where it would not come together. The sleeves were also very long and very tight at the arm hole. It's a  pretty piece but the sizing is a big problem. Also, the embroidered panel does not fill the whole area; there is a 6-8&#34; empty space at the top where it joins with the darker fabric."
2.0,I'm on the short side so that played a part in the dress being to big.
2.0,"I have to say that this is a really nice dress. I bought it for my daughter’s birthday and she looked fantastic. The problem is that we hand washed it just once and when we put it in the dryer it lost all the flowers and it got stained somehow, maybe from the cheap glue. This is a $6 - $7 item that is way overpriced. I paid over $20 for a disposable dress."
2.0,"I'm going to return them. I ordered the size I wear in everything and even on my right foot (the slightly bigger one), I was swimming in them."
2.0,Size is off . Too short compared to other med tanks tops
2.0,"Not high waisted, not even close. The pattern was cute and I like that they're lined. But these are a size too small (I wear an 8 and bought the M for 8-10), cut into my thighs, and definitely didn't function as high waisted. They dug into my hips, creating a very unflattering silhouette that made me look way wider than I am. I've got a shorter torso and an hourglass figure and I didn't find that these did justice to my shape."
2.0,Not sewn well
2.0,The color is ok but the fabric is cheap
2.0,It says these are pants but they’re too short. They are like capris! I’m not sure which ones they are?
2.0,"Not a bad looking top. But I did not get the size I asked for. Not worth sending back for the price, but I can't use it."
2.0,I love the look of this bracelet! However it randomly fell off which led to me finally losing my Fitbit! I’m wondering if The seller of this bracelet will do anything? I would like to order another one but I am very hesitant now.
2.0,"I ordered a shirt in November and liked the way it fit, so I ordered three more in March. The new shirts were longer than the old, despite having the exact same customization options (eg. Length : Medium, Fit : Classic).<br /><br />I contacted support, and they helped me re-order the proper fit. The support agent even checked that the item in my cart was correct. However, when I received those they were also too long.<br /><br />So, welcome to the future, you can get custom-fit t-shirts. But when you try to order more you get a different size.<br /><br />UPDATE: June 2022<br />I want so much to love this product. The quality of the material is great. It now seems like they've ironed out the wrinkles I ran into in the past so I can re-order the same size again.<br /><br />The problem I'm running into now is that there's no way to make an adjustment to a shirt I like. I have a shirt that fits well. I'd like to add an inch to it and order some longer ones. But since I've been wearing it for awhile, the tool does not let me select it in the list of shirts I can adjust. You can only adjust recent orders. The only solution seems to be to a) reorder the shirt, and then b) send it back and request and adjustment. It should be easier to make adjustment to an order that I know I like."
2.0,"This was so pretty, really bummed that it didnt fit"
2.0,"Heavy and with poor quality color , after a few days it doesn't seem as a gold tone."
2.0,"I ordered an XL. The shirt and sleeves were too short while the waist was loose. The material is cheap, and the way the seams taper up and out made me look like an inverted triangle. Returned."
2.0,"These are decent glasses and get the job done for my tired old eyes, but they aren't spring hinge - the main reason (besides seeing) I got these.  But they were cheap so I'll keep them"
2.0,"liked the ring, but it broke in half had to order another one. If this one breaks I will not order another."
2.0,ordered an xxl and fits like a medium
2.0,The product is a little too stretchy but generally fits well.
2.0,Not what I expected. Quality seems very poor and the rose color has rubbed off half the ring.....
2.0,"I love the brand, but this cotton set was not what you normally get with Carole Hochman. Not as soft and comfy as most other of their products."
2.0,I really liked the glasses but the nose pieces fell off rendering the glasses useless!
2.0,The top tank top looks nothing like what is in the pictures. It has some sort of design sequence on it. You couldn't wear a regular bra with it. I wanted the style in the pictures not this. I ordered a large. I'm 5'5&#34; 150 pounds and wear a 36C. It's loose on me. Other than the description not being true and correct it is a decent dress otherwise. The fabric doesn't feel cheap. The waist area is weird though. It definitely needs that belt for it to take away from the loose looking appearance in the waist area. I'm actually surprised it's loose. I'll try to post pictures when I have a free minute.
2.0,They were delivered just a month ago and both are already coming apart. This one is worse than the other. We're trying to find some kind of cobblers glue or something to get them back together so my daughter can keep wearing them but I want everyone else to be aware of how quickly this will happen.
2.0,No help at night.  Would not buy again
2.0,"This runs incredibly big. More on the men's size than the women's size. I am an average size woman 5ft 6in and 160 pounds and this tie is way too big for me and can't adjust small enough. It has a tab to adjust it but fully shrunk in, it is still WAY to big. I had to fold it over on itself and sew it to make it fit me so unless you have a huge men's sized neck, find another product or be prepared to dismantle it and make the alterations yourself. The tie itself is of good quality and well put together but just was not designed for a woman's neck."
2.0,I ordered this to use for college. I used it during my summer semester and by the time the semester was over it fell apart.
2.0,Poor fit. Very thin material.
2.0,Smaller than look in picture
2.0,"Hard to breaath when filter inserted, but ineffective without filter."
2.0,Runs small .... But mad cute !
2.0,"Fit well except for upper arms, I don’t have the skinniest of upper arms but I had to roll down the sleeve for it to be comfortable which defeated the purpose of covering my arm up to my shirt sleeve. And now I’m stuck because the return window just closed."
2.0,It's very pretty. But too heavy to wear.
2.0,"Nice hat but too small for a man, kid's hat maybe?"
2.0,"Cute dress, but fabric was thin, fit runs small"
2.0,I bought them for my daughter and she wore them one time and the velcro straps broke<br />Very disappointed with the quality
2.0,TOOOO small and cheap material BUT they were cheap so can't complain about that...but order at least 2-3 sizes bigger than what you really are!
2.0,It's a pretty blue but it is flimsy and doesn't stretch tight. I wondered why it was so inexpensive .
2.0,Squeaky when you walk and ran quite small - at least a half size. I'm a true 7.5 but the sandal wasn't.  They also gave off a very strong plastic-y smell.
2.0,The stem broke off the earring two weeks after recieving them. Love the look just not very good quality.
2.0,Way to large!  Maybe for men?
2.0,"Bottoms fit perfectly well. Correct size, great stretch & comfort. Shirt fits TWO TIMES TOO SMALL. I am a size large-woman’s 12. I ordered a large. The shirt was so tight that it fits my daughter who is a petite size 8 women just right. SO disappointed. If ordering, I recommend sizing up at least one. If larger chested-size up TWO."
2.0,"This resembled pajamas more than a sun dress. Cute pattern, thin fabric. Maybe paired with the right jewelry, belt, and shoes? On its own doesn’t quite make the fashion cut, but would be comfortable for lounging around the house on a hot summer day."
2.0,Shipping took forever and when I got it some parts of it look rusted. You get what you paid for I guess.
2.0,My BF is usually a size 5X. We bought an 6<br />It was small it hardly buttoned.
2.0,"material is rough and clinches, static-filled no matter what i do."
2.0,Different product is pictured. My daughter loves this brand. We had to order theses from different seller.
2.0,This is a cute handbag but for some reason the loop that closes around the button kept coming off of the button which left the handbag open.
2.0,"I loved these sunglasses when I first purchased them and thought my days of toggling between readers and sunglasses were over. However, I discovered that one of the lens pops out easily and frequently. This changed my opinion quickly. I paid a little more, hoping that the quality be better, apparently not."
2.0,Way to big i needed a small i got a med
2.0,I thought this product would have been thicker and fit to size it's an extra large but it fit as if it's a youth extra large I'm about to give it to my younger niece
2.0,"Material is rough feeling, and because of the material it requires hand washing line dry. As well ironing. Not a<br />Fan of any of these"
2.0,"Very cute but the material feels cheap. I like the style enough I was going to keep it anyway but when I put it on to go out the cheapness of the material made me not want to wear it, even uncomfortable, so unfortunately i felt it wasn’t worth keeping & I’m returning it."
2.0,i didn't like how it fit and i went by your size chart and the neck was way to big. All of shirt was to big all over
2.0,"I usually wear L/XL and ordered XXL to ensure it would fit according to measurements. Could not get it on. Good material, etc. just too small."
2.0,"These are beautiful earrings. However the quality is horrible. I was really looking forward to wearing these. I purchased them and I didn't get a chance to wear them. They were in the box for a few weeks before I opened them ""to wear them"". On the FIRST attempt to wear them I removed them from the box (removing the backing off the stem of the earring), the post broke from the earring. I was so disappointed 😞. Though I read similar reviews before making the purchase I still wanted to give them a try (thinking maybe those purchases were just a bad batch). Lesson learned. I don't like writing sour reviews but this product needs improvement in quality."
2.0,It was below par. Try something else. I know I will.
2.0,"As beautiful as this watch was when I received it and how well made it felt, the chronograph began to malfunction after just one hour on the wrist. After another hour, the watch began to lose 10 minutes every hour. Had to return it."
2.0,"I had to straighten and rebend them because they stuck out. I suppose that is to be expected because everyone's nose is different. But i doubt very many people have a thick enough nostril to use it the way it is.<br />The stainless steel is darker and less shiny than I was hoping for. I guess I've never had a bezel set nose stud before, I didn't realise how much of the dark steel would show when I'm wearing it.<br />Those things are annoying, but my biggest issue is that the stones fall out after a day or two. I take out the stud while I'm getting ready for bed so I can exfoliate my face. In the morning, I put it back in after I put on my makeup. So it's not getting snagged on blankets or anything.<br />I guess I'm still looking for the perfect nose stud."
2.0,"Bought for my 6 year old and the glasses don’t even fit my 3 year old’s face. The bow tie is a pain to clip onto a shirt. The Hat is okay, but over all not worth the money."
2.0,I am a size 12. The lace fans out a lot at the waist so I looked even bigger than I am. I liked the idea but the lace shouldn't be gathered. Not flattering.
2.0,It's an okay sweater. Not as thick as you would think based on the braided styling. Fit was too small so I gave it to a friend.
2.0,Different product... !!
2.0,pop easliy
2.0,"This is what the dress looks like. Did fit true to measurements (thankfully we measured b/c she wears a 4 dress but measurements said to buy a 6). Does not show off her hourglass shape though and can not see all the shear fabric in the original pictures. she is 5'6"" and it is  good length. Definately not as elegant as ad makes it look."
2.0,Good fit and comfortable but the off-gassing from the rubber is terrible. Have to leave them outside. It’s been a month.
2.0,This was not natural color it is painted it  comes right off very disappointed  apart from colors were shown as deeper darker crystal not painted quartz
2.0,The wallet is made with great material and seems to be durable so far. Fits all of my cards and I can organize everything you just nicely. Unfortunately I've only been using it for 2 days and the zipper is already starting to form waves and giving me problems.  They should have used a higher quality zipper and then it would have been the perfect wallet.
2.0,Way too loose and baggy. Has this weird fringe on the arm holes and the neck.<br />Neck was super loose and looked horrible. Material was fine but it what I wanted.
2.0,"Very small, I'm a size 0 to 2 ???"
2.0,"The fabric is great, lightweight and perfect for warm weather.  However, this runs about 2-3 sizes too small."
2.0,Bought this for my wife but she didn't like it. It doesn't look as beautiful as in the photos so I'm sad about it
2.0,"I couldn't wear this without a complete slip underneath because the material is so thin. The picture shows the tunic hanging beautifully, but the sizing is way too small. There's not as much fullness below the breastline as it shows. Very disappointing."
2.0,I thought it had the screw back and had ordered it for my 5 yr old. It has a regular back and the push backs looked discolored.
2.0,looks good in the picture but pieces had fallen off in the package.
2.0,"I've bought several of these dresses, in the same size, and this one is WAAAAAYYYYY too small. I didn't bother to try it on when I got it (stupid me) because I have bought so many. I went to wear it today, and could barely get it over my head. I also missed the return window, so I am stuck like Chuck with a dress that is too small, and can't return it. Just be cautious, people!"
2.0,"Not very comfy, scratchy seams inside & stiff material"
2.0,Colors are much brighter (more harsh vs pastel) than they appear - not as soft/silky as it looks in pic
2.0,They hoops are way smaller than I anticipated....I don't think I have large ear lobes either....
2.0,"Customer service was good, the thought process behind the buckle system is genius, but the buckle consistently comes loose.  Not sure if it's the quality of this line but you may want to spend a little more and look elsewhere."
2.0,Beautiful but very very sheer you can see underwear when wearing
2.0,"I bought this dress in the black stars and the dark green. The more I looked at these dresses, the worse they got. Fit is as the chart says, but the arm lengths were pretty short and I have short arms. . Issue is with the quality. As soon as I took them out of the bag, I noticed the stars were peeling off and almost every seam has loose threads. The green dress has one finished hem on the sleeve and the other is raw edge. Also, the seam along the bust in front had been hand sewn by what looks like a toddler. Like someone purchased this dress, stitched it up so their boobs wouldn’t hang out and then decided to return it like that. These were very poorly made and disappointing."
2.0,"I can alter and cut the fabric to make it fit better. Some might like the big gaping fabric in front, not me."
2.0,I ordered a large and it was way too big for me. I usually buy large and it fits me properly.
2.0,I had the band for the less than a week and the paint is already chipping off
2.0,Very bulky and heavy.  Doesnt lay flat due to weight.
2.0,"Too small, did not cover my behind and I am 5'8&#34; (not overweight)."
2.0,Unfortunately the case they came in was cracked. And kind of expected a variety
2.0,"I knew this was a low quality product when I ordered it, but for under 3 dollars I wanted to compare it to my B&L 10x Hastings Triplet. No competition. The triplet has a smaller diameter but objects are in focus throughout while the SE with it's larger diameter can only focus on a very minimal field of vision. Spend the extra money and go for quality if this is to be used for anything other than a toy."
2.0,It looks so much better in the picture. Its flimsy and thin. I love the idea but this piece is poorly made.
2.0,"I would have kept this dress, but there was a very funny smell to it when I opened the package and didn't trust that the smell would not come out after a wash so I will return it."
2.0,Buen anillos
2.0,"These socks are full of acrylic, which is the worst possible material for clothing, with the possible exception of cardboard. The product page for these socks lists only wool and nylon, and that's deceptive."
2.0,"If you had looked at the Sterling Silver version of this piece first, as I did, you would probably think this was the same size, but with the gold plating and &#34;diamond&#34; accent...  It is not-  it is essentially 1/2 the size of the silver pendant, about the size of a dime.  Product description doesn't seem to list a size for the actual pendant, so buyer beware."
2.0,"This was very tight and a ribbed cotton, didn't work for me."
2.0,Product was damaged smal tears in all of them
2.0,"Love the dress; however it was torn under each arm when I received it in the mail. Even so, I love the dress so I'm going to have it repaired. Despite reading the reviews on how cheaply it was made, I still bought it."
2.0,"I'm a 34DDD and needed something I could get on without a struggle after back surgery. This thing was a beast to get zipped over the girls, yet once I finally won the war, it was not very supportive at all and gave me a very odd shape. If I'd gone down another size, there's no way I could have zipped it, yet I still don't think it would qualify as ""high impact."" Sad because I love other sports bras by this brand. But this one was a giant swing and a miss for me."
2.0,"After carefully reading reviews for other brands, these shorts appeared to be the best choice.  Fit was great, BUT the design is defective. The padding is too far back in the crotch to provide comfort, which is why I was buying padded bike shorts!"
2.0,The dress was large in size. The top part is see through.
2.0,"Many of them did not work at all. Some of them only worked for a few minutes before going out. We are a family of 5 and had ONE fun afternoon playing with them. After that, there were only a few left to play with and those quickly ran out of battery too. All in all not a good buy."
2.0,Cute socks but no holding power. Too big and baggy.
2.0,"I'm giving it a bad review because tapers are bad for your ears. The quality of these are top notch, though. The sad reality is, tapers force your ears to stretch, and it's done so gradually you think it's not doing anything bad. But in reality it can lead to a lot of micro tears and complications in the future as you continue to stretch. I ordered these before I learned the proper way of stretching."
2.0,feels more like pj's vs clothes to wear out and they are definitely Not Leggings
2.0,The bow on the dress was much smaller than the picture
2.0,Did its job pretty well for about 4 months and then the screen started fogging up. Which meant it was completely waterproof as the back of the watch says. This eventually killed off most of the features but the hands on the dial kept trucking on till the bitter end.
2.0,The top fitted fine but the bottoms were wayyy too small
2.0,"Cute, but legs were too skinny"
2.0,"Fit as expected, but the material was stiff and uncomfortable."
2.0,Runs small.The color is off quite a bit from the picture.Had snags as soon as I removed it from the package.
2.0,"I loved the look of this suit when I got it but as other reviews stated, the girls fall out the sides. Poor design and it's too bad they don't fix that flaw because i really wanted to wear this one to the beach."
2.0,"One of the adjustable arms broke the second time I wore them. No big deal I guess? I knew I what I was buying I wad hoped they would of made it a bit longer. Lens quality was good, they fit well and would of been good enough for me. I mean as a cyclist, I hate spending top dollar on something that is just going to get beat up very quickly."
2.0,"Cute dress, large does not cover size c-d cup, 5’ 9” 150 lbs size large is too small"
2.0,I was looking for some underwear that was comfortable for all day wear but still cute. Unfortunately these are the illest fitting underwear I've ever had. There is nothing low rise about them. I'm 5'2 125 lbs and though they fit my butt the elastic is tighter than the other material and it makes me look like I have love handles. The rest of the material is actually slightly loose so going to a bigger size wouldnt work. I'm only a size 2 or 4 pants so my proportions aren't crazy. They'll be fine to sleep in or in jeans but I don't plan on wearing them in anything tight fitting or leggings.
2.0,"This would easily be a five-star reading as the belt itself is very sturdy and the velcro works very well. However, when I first ordered this product all that was sent to me was an empty envelope... I immediately filed a return dispute. My return required me to send back the item. There was no item to send back though. I contacted customer support with this company who assured me I did not need to send back the empty envelope and that they took care of the return. 30 days later I was billed again..."
2.0,Nice design  - but only a few colors worked after 1 day - But the price was right - its just not a full delivery on expectations
2.0,"Got for my fitbit versa 2 and it is not as good as the fitbit brand. Maybe for the price, but id rather have quality of im wearing it everyday."
2.0,"It fit really tight on the arms, and the torso was way to short for me. I got a medium (US), and usually that's a little big for me so that says a lot"
2.0,Fits like a t shirt
2.0,Right now it's in my purse. The clasp keeps coming off.
2.0,Bought this for my son and the first time he put it on two parts broke. The hearts on the knee came right off and the knee straps don't work.  This wasn't cheap so I expected it to be better quality but I guess not.
2.0,bought the xtra larges and they seemed short
2.0,Like most socks of this type these should basically be balled up and shoved under your foot in your shoe immediately. That is where they are going to end up within moments anyway.
2.0,more on  orange -red color and thin material.
2.0,they run  to big feet get blister in big toes every time i wear them even tried wearing thicker socks
2.0,"The dress is pretty, but it's too big. The dress doesn't have belt loops to secure the belt. I did get compliments about the dress."
2.0,"Has plenty of room inside and is really cute, but you get what you paid for in the fact that my strapped ripped after only a days use and the zipper kept splitting apart. I wouldn’t recommend if you are looking for a longer holding purse."
2.0,They are very dark tinted
2.0,"Disappointed the color started to wear off the first day. The bottom side is extremely easy to scratch and scuff the color right off.  After less than a week a lot of the color has worn off the links on the bottom, revealing a silver stainless steel color.<br /><br />It's a shame, because it fits well and included everything you need to remove links to get it to the right size.  If the finish was a little better, I'd give it five stars."
2.0,Hat is a almost a skull cap very small
2.0,"I am pretty petite so most tanks fit me larger, but this tank was really small especially in the arm holes. It was so constructing around my underarms, that I couldn't wear it. Other than that it was very thick and nice quality - so its a bummer it didn't fit!"
2.0,"I ordered the first dress (size Large) according to the size chart provided. It arrived and though the bust fit, it was ridiculously short. I recall it being short by a few inches from the description. I returned it and ordered the XL. It arrived, the length was the same and the bust was incredibly large. Unfortunately I had to return this as well. This dress is a good fit for someone shorter than I (5'4&#34;) with little to no behind."
2.0,"My Only real issue is that the threads holding the mitten parts back, broke within 2 seconds upon putting them on."
2.0,Nice scarf for people who like to just get up and go pretty
2.0,"Ordered this in a XXL so it would b nice n lose, roomier and soft. Well it’s soft like tshirt material. However this shirt is Extremely narrow or slim that the drains bulge out the sides, like if I where carrying baseballs in my pockets, the snaps also bulge open. I normally wear a size 12 so this was a waste of my hard earned $$ when I needed it the most !"
2.0,The wheels get stuck often and it does not pull as easily as I would like it to. I would not buy this again.
2.0,"I'm usually between a small and a medium as I have a large chest, so it could go either way.  I ordered the medium to err on the side of caution, which was the wrong choice!  If you are between sizes, definitely order on the smaller side.  This dress is super loose and baggy on me as a medium, but a small probably would have fit perfectly.  I'm 5'2, 125 lbs."
2.0,"No support, The top tie is very stretchy, if you are not small up top this suit will not work for you. Color is off some this is not navy, but the color  was acceptable, lighter blue ."
2.0,"I ordered these because they are &#34;Amber.&#34; What I got is actually purple tint. Purple do not work for me because it makes everything too dark with my motorcycle helmet. I needed amber. But, they are better than nothing at this point."
2.0,"I love the design of this. But my first case broke within a month... the design was fading, the magnetic strap fell off and you cannot take a picture with the flash because the case partially blocks the flash and causes the color to distort. So I returned the item and the company was quick to respond and very friendly. They replaced the case free of charge. But the new case also broke within a month with pretty much the same problems. I figured there was no point in returning it again so I just used it for a couple more months until where the case folds completely ripped. It was cute for the short time it lasted!"
2.0,"Really was excite for this shirt. Unfortunately, the fit is off. Runs very small."
2.0,"The swim dress is cute and comfortable, however, I did not receive the bottoms."
2.0,"We had a little difficulty finding the right size of these shoes for my daughter. We ordered too sizes and while one seemed too small and one seemed too large, she chose a size and we stuck with it. They are cute and I like that the bottom is a little thick to prevent pain from stepping on something sharp. All that being said, after just a few wears, the bottom of the insole started falling apart and was all over the inside of the shoe and all over my daughters feet. We buy water shoes for my daughter due to some sensory processing difficulties, so clearly the insole flaking is an issue! I would not purchase these again."
2.0,This is the second time I have ordered shirts and they came with a stain!!!! It's a pretty top except for the stain
2.0,"This watch is laughably small. I'm not talking small compared to a 50mm watch, I'm talking this-looks-like-it-belongs-on-a-build-a-bear small. Hilarious. When I opened it I just laughed and was thankful I didn't drop much money on it. I love watches and I don't think I'm that critical, but this is just silly. It's a dorky little kids watch."
2.0,"It's a cute one-time wear outfit. The pants were VERY short, and the shine washed off the first time they went to the laundry. They're very thin material amd nearly see through once washed. The top runs small, and the color from the applique bleeds with sweat, let alone washing."
2.0,I wish there were more sizes available. I measured myself and thought I would fit into the L size. Nope.
2.0,Really wish they would have emailed like the last time to let me know it was going to be 2 sizes larger then what was ordered. It was for a co-worker who had a dinner party to attend and had to spend extra to have it taken up. It was too late to reorder. When you have limited places to shop you do rely on proper communication of what a company has in Stock.<br />ON THE OTHER HAND<br />The dress was beautiful and so comfortable to wear. The material was soft and stretchy but most of all hide troubled spots and was a hit at dinner party
2.0,ran smaller then expected. and waaaay to long!
2.0,"I wish they had displayed a pic of the back of the charm.  It's unfinished on the back, so if it flips over it looks bad. Just not happy with the quality of this item."
2.0,don't recomend it
2.0,Watch band split along pin channel after less thank 1 week
2.0,"Very disappointed... Asian sizing NOT Western sizes<br />I am normally a Medium but ordered an Extra large thinking that would make up for the small sizing<br />Not even close...<br />However the company was very accommodating the return . If the company ever decides to make the costs available in realistic USA sizes, I would definitely re order!!!!"
2.0,This suit was ok. The strings were way too loose when it arrived and it took a very long time to adjust them to be right enough. When the strings were finally tight enough to hold the suit up they were also cutting into my shoulders. I wish this suit had fit comfortably because once the strings were tightened it looked very cute on.
2.0,The bracelet is very thin; so thin that you can barely read the word “sisters“ engraved on it.
2.0,"If these were just a tad smaller they'd be PERFECT, IF THE COLOR DIDN'T FADE SO FAST. I bought a similar nose ring from Spencer's. It cost 11 dollars. It's a bit more dainty but the little balls on the end are smaller. The large balls on these keep them in place and make them very comfortable! Too bad they're all gonna be silver, after 1 day of use."
2.0,The hood is too small to actually wear. The fit itself is perfect though.
2.0,"It could just be me, but it fit really odd and the material is not what I expected. The product is very well made though"
2.0,"I love the look of these.  Unfortunately, the plastic nose piece fell off both pairs that I bought.  Not able to re-attach, so they are now pretty much worthless to me.  Disappointed for sure."
2.0,"This is the sheerest material I have ever seen. Black bra, nude bra - doesn't matter you can see through both. This requires a slip to wear, and I hate wearing slips"
2.0,2 books out of 3 I received in a set have a low quality print.
2.0,Very pretty but the shoulders were way too small.  Definitely for a very petite woman.
2.0,Son muy cómodos pero son muy resbalosos<br />En el piso mojado o aceite
2.0,Worked well for 3 months but the the keys got disengaged from the product
2.0,This didn't look good on me.  I'm 5' 105 lbs.  Ordered a Small and it was very tight.  The shirt rises up.  I returned it.  It's very cute tho.  It doesn't give you much of a push up like it's advertised.
2.0,I ordered a large for my daughter and she weighs about 130 lbs and the top was about 3 sizes to small and the skirt is about small to medium fit. Quality was okay but definitely pay attention to size.
2.0,Lots of compliments.  Its very cute. I wear it as a layer over a white  Spaghetti strap dress.
2.0,The colors are nothing like what is shown online.
2.0,"Doesn’t work, the cooling packs are no different than the regular freezer packs that can be bought for muscle strains etc. and melt very fast! Don’t last as long as they stated. Doesn’t keep you cool!"
2.0,"It looks pretty cheap and is also too small for a regular head. Made for kids, or something... not worth it!"
2.0,Beware they leave black marks around the bridge of your nose!
2.0,"As a lover of purple, I thought these were right up my alley.  I didn't love them however.  I wanted to, but just didn't.  They look somewhat cheap to me."
2.0,They fell apart in 2 days very cheaply made
2.0,"My daughter loved these shoes for about 10 days. That’s how long the lights lasted. My 2 sons also got these in black, none of them lasted more than 2 weeks. When I notifIed the company, they gave me a refund."
2.0,"Decent mask, but definitely not as pictured. The mask I received only has one strap (albeit a pretty substantial one), the bottom teeth are a different shape, it’s smaller (doesn’t wrap all the way around the jawline over the ear and the coloring is completely different than the one pictured on Amazon. The one pictured on the listing is more true to the original Predator film (Tan and swamp green with black spots), but the one I received is orangish tan with brown spots. All-in-all, it’s a decent mask for the price and will suffice for what I’m going to use it for. Hint for the buyer if you receive one with only one strap… if you pull the strap over the rear of your head crown, the mask actually stays on really well."
2.0,"Elegant? Forget it. IT is cheaply made, it is okay but not elegant. Understandably, it is not price, for exact those qualities (or lack of them). Will not return it, but won't be wearing it ever."
2.0,I dont even have a B cup and my boobs wont fit. Nipple sticks out. Too self conscious bout falling out in an awkward way that I wont wear. It tore when I tried it on
2.0,Only wore one time... hurt feet and uncomfortable.
2.0,Its he size of a pea; the picture here is deceptive; not at all worth the price. The appearance is different too. Very clever of the seller not to show a picture of a woman wearing it.
2.0,My granddaughter Loved it
2.0,I liked the design the moisture wicking but the shirts were too small and short I was most uncomfortable with hiw short they are I don't think anyone is comfortable with a shirt that is going to be riding up as you move.
2.0,"After one washing in the sink, the paint started peeling.<br />I wish they offered a regular Arsenal mug, without the heat activation nonsense."
2.0,The earings look much bigger in the picture than they really are. It's very misleading.
2.0,"The product picture shows a thick, blue and white apron in crisp colors. It arrived as a thin, see through gray and blue apron."
2.0,I ordered a size large and I don't think it is even a medium. The care instructions are barely readable and don't make sense to me. The fabric is nice and looks good. I will be returning the shirt.
2.0,I was hoping for comfortable at home capri. The extra large is tight on me and normally I would wear a med or large.  These are more like slightly to short slacks than capri pants.  I am 5’8” so not a short person.  I would not buy again but will not return as I may find use for them.
2.0,Loved it but turned colors.
2.0,Ridiculously small. More like the size for a baby/toddler.
2.0,The product was too small. It was delivered as promised timely and efficiently.
2.0,Fits very small!
2.0,This had a weird fit for me. Was not comfy. Dug into me and the weird pads on the inside made the entire bra fit weird. Did not look good.
2.0,Returned. Cheap material
2.0,brought  it by mistake
2.0,"Cheap no lining no support, good for younger fit woman"
2.0,"The watch band is attractive. The rose gold is bright and shiny. Problem #1 - the band is very long and has two magnets to secure it on your risk. Getting it on is cumbersome because the first magnet grabs hold of the metal band, and it's just an odd design. Problem #2 (the main problem), the edges of the band snag EVERYTHING!! I've ruined a couple blouses because of rough edges on this band snagging threads. I would not buy this again due to the snagging."
2.0,I purchased to Blue one last year and loved it.  This year I purchased the pink one and was shocked by the poor quality.  The blue one was thick and roomy and had more material sewn into it for shaping.  This one was cheaply made and thin.<br /><br />The quality was so poor compared to the blue one I purchased last year.  The collar wasn't even double materials and it fits funny too.
2.0,The dress has thread hanging everywhere off of it. It came very wrinkled. The only reason I am keeping it is because my daughter loves it.
2.0,The foot size ran really big
2.0,"Dropped and wood snapped, decent watch but not worth the money."
2.0,Face and mouth is much too large. Kind of creepy. Didn’t wear it.
2.0,BEAUTIFUL solid ring. The only problem was that it snagged things which makes it unwearable...
2.0,Pilled after first wash
2.0,I feel that some of the stones are too large to look real. My personal opinion.  I'm sure many like the larger stones.
2.0,"Quality of the fabric and shirt are good, but the color faded after 9 months.<br /><br />I have probably washed it once a month and after 9 months it's ready for the donation pile because the black has faded to a shabby grey.<br /><br />Notice in the attached photo how the buttons are completely black, but the shirt has faded considerably."
2.0,Lack of detail of compared to the pictures.
2.0,"I won’t lie, it looks pretty cool and it’s very versatile but after only two weeks of using it (only notebooks and ocasionally a 13” laptop) the zipper main it’s broken! I’ve tried all day long to fix it but it’s impossible. Nice item but not worth it for only two weeks"
2.0,"Low quality, cute gift for a child though at this price point."
2.0,"The item made me look smooth but not smaller. I probably should have ordered a smaller size but due to the material, I don't think that would have made a difference."
2.0,"Look not like in the picture, the wire part is rough. Not pretty. I'm not satisfired. Should have returned them."
2.0,Fit as expected however the right side pocket was sown so weird that the right sized crumple up weird
2.0,"the material is kinda flimsy , shrinks to the extreme. nice & warm though."
2.0,Had to return it.  It ran small.  Otherwise it was a very nice looking belt and the material and construction seemed very good.
2.0,Super cute necklace but after about a week my neck turned green and I had to throw it away.
2.0,Myself.
2.0,The buttons are low quality plastic and the leather cord ends came undone within a couple weeks.
2.0,"This dress is actually really really cute, I love the dress! All though it was a week and a half late getting to me. When I finally did get it, in the front of the dress at the bottom of where it starts to lace up there was a tear in it. But it does fit to my normal size just right! Amazon and there customer service about the 2 issues where super awesome about making sure things where made right for me and in a fast manner!"
2.0,Great looking tie . The zipper broke the first Time I touched it .
2.0,Very boxy and unflattering.
2.0,"I was so excited to get this mask, since I had purchase  another one and that one had the straw mouth piece at the side ( who as their mouth at the side.<br />So this look perfect, well no the mouth piece keeps coming off. I had to get this strong glue and glue it.  The fabric is very cheap.  Good idea but needs some improvements.<br />I hope it works now that I glued it."
2.0,They are better than nothing
2.0,"They look great out of the package, but once washed and hung to dry the white band crinkled..."
2.0,"CUTE SLIPPERS, I HAD TO SPRAY FABREEZE ON THEM FOR SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE WEARING"
2.0,"I wear a size 71/2 shoe (average)...I have stretched the sock as far as it will go, and can't even get my toes in them...and they won't let me return them...very disappointed..."
2.0,It pulled so badly when washed. I have not used it yet but it looks 10 years old.
2.0,Bought these with toddler sunglasses for my 2 year old niece. We could not get the stems to fit into the opening. We even tried cutting it a little and it didn't work.
2.0,NOT worth what I paid.  Super cheap and cheesy.  Was expecting a lot higher quality for $25.  Ridiculous.
2.0,"Much flimsier than pictured, not my style. Form over function."
2.0,Nice shirt. Just too tight in the shoulders.
2.0,"The shirt was very nice looking, but I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear, and it was still very short and snug"
2.0,Much smaller in all ways vs. the pictures. They feel like women’s glasses.
2.0,"Very pretty dress! Lots of layers of tulle! Unfortunately, even with the lace up back, there is not a lot of coverage up front. My daughter was not able to use it. I would say the dress would work best for up to a D cup size."
2.0,This dress was made of polyester and was extremely fitted liked an under garment slip. It wasn't flattering at all so I returned it.
2.0,"This was shorter than pictured. I ended up returning it. Very pretty, though."
2.0,"Hurt my ears, stiff fabric, large fit"
2.0,I’ve been looking at this dress for a while and was pretty disappointed when received. The material is pretty cheap and so is the total look of the dress. The zipper was not sewn right and looked pulled in the back. The darts in the bust area  were kind of pointy. The material reminded me of a Halloween costume I made a while back when you just want something cheap and quick. I didn’t send it back because the shipping cost more than the dress.  Never again.
2.0,They are really nice but they do not fit my Tragus piercing!
2.0,Skimpy material and smaller than expected. Returned.
2.0,More comfortable than plastic solid bands. Stretch fine. Con: clip design allows band to slip and loosen. A little annoying.
2.0,"Wish I got a size down.... I'm an XS so I'm learning overtime that a Small in items that run small fit fine. Please note that the bottom is a thing. Mine came torn, going to ask for a replacement on the bottom"
2.0,Fuzz everywhere I can’t wear it bc I end up looking like a lint catcher- even after it was washed several times
2.0,I did not like these leggings. The fit fine but I felt like the material was to thin and reveling. Did not like the way they fit.
2.0,"The dress (size large) fits well except in the bust. I went by the &#34;size guide&#34; clickable next to the size selection tab, but I think I should've heeded the &#34;Asia sizes run smaller&#34; advice. The color is a bit grayer than expected, and the underneath fabric (front only) is a bit scratchy. Even with color and &#34;scratchy&#34; issues, I like the style well enough that I would've kept the dress if the sizing had been right."
2.0,The blue pair fit perfectly but the white and black pair were small and did nothing for butt lift.
2.0,"I’ve always worn a cup size C or D. I ordered a D and it was still too small. It sticks well the first time you put it on, but if you try to readjust a couple times it won’t stay on completely. It does a nice job of pulling the girls together to close the “gap” but doesn’t give a push up effect like it advertises. I was really hopeful for these bras, but I plan on returning them."
2.0,Why add more plastic into the world to produce these guys.  Bought as fun props at a party.  Just realize your buying disposable plastic glasses
2.0,I liked the look of bracelet but lost it the first time I wore it.  It weighs very little  so I didn't notice. I understand it is modestly priced but some redesign on the clasp is warranted
2.0,"Cute purse, but the shorter handles fell off within the first 15minutes of using it for the first time. Very cheaply made!"
2.0,"I have a small head and it did not look right on me.  The fit was definitely too small for me, but it will fit a toddlers head, that's for sure.  I did like the quality of the fabric and the color."
2.0,They describe these as good for sports I guess they could be  .I found them to bulky with this weird hairy material that is what is next to your ears<br /> I was looking for something sleeker  for winter hiking and running . I will probably throw these away they were cheap and that's what I got cheap ear warmers
2.0,"The actual colors are different, the purple is just regular amethyst, with all the associated defects like pale color and weird dark spots, but the 'scaling' on those looked okay. The blue ones were the biggest letdown, they're more of a teal in real life, not the cyan blue in the picture. Also one of the two didn't really have the pattern on it. Overall they seem like okay plugs, but not what I expected, so I'll be returning them."
2.0,Didn't work for me. Product was too stiff to easily be accessible for switching out glasses. But there will be another use I'm sure for it.
2.0,Wasnt satisfied at all .....
2.0,"I liked the concept, but for me, it was very clumsy to get it to put it on a piece of baggage. Probably would work well for something small, but for a large bag, it initially took me a half hour to get it right. Then the problem is getting it tight. I could not find a method other than clip it, see if it is tight, unclip it, try again. There are two clips so you do this twice. The purpose of all this is to prevent a semi-rigid, large suitcase from ripping its zipper due to over-packing (take my wife). All of this though becomes useless, as the folks who open your bag to remove the bombs that aren't in there didn't know half of what I knew about putting these things on a bag. They figured out how to loosen them up (which I don't understand), but did not put them back on the way they found them. So even if you're more technically inclined than I am, it might be pointless to use these straps."
2.0,I'm a large. Ordered xxl still to small. Wife is wearing now
2.0,"First, there's no belt loops. It was represented as having them.<br />Second, the material is super, super thin.<br />Third, fake pockets on the sides of the legs.<br />Fourth, no elastic or ties to cinch up the leg openings.<br />Fifth, the gray is not gray, it's black.<br />Not what I was expecting and I think it's wrong to misrepresent these as being a rugged type of shorts. These are loungewear for a chilly night around the pool."
2.0,"These boots seem to be designed for someone with a wider foot/leg.<br />The shoe part of the boot fits loose as does the ankle so it gives an unflattering look when walking because it somewhat smooches in. Like deflating plastic.<br />The soles are made with a sub par material and seem cheaply manufactured.<br />The boots are fairly lightweight which I suppose in some ways can be a good thing, but in terms of durability, it’s questionable.<br />The stitching/design is decent and I like it however due to the seemingly sloppy look the boots give on my body, I’d likely only wear under a long dress where the extra wide style can be masked."
2.0,If I can figure out how to open the clasp I will change my rating because it is pretty!
2.0,Like PJ material
2.0,"There’s nothing ""wrong"" with them but they’re unimpressive. Looks very cheap and huge on wrist. Also had a very unpleasant smell when I first unboxed them."
2.0,This is a cheap rayon material.  Fits loose
2.0,Runs small all areas.
2.0,"I came very close to returning these, since I ordered them thinking they were 100% cotton, but saw this on the back of the package when it arrived:<br /><br />100% COTTON<br />75% COTTON<br />25% POLYESTER<br /><br />Here is the expanation for that:<br />Five pairs per package are 100% cotton, but for some unknown reason, they add an unwanted polyester blend pair (the grey ones.) I still got five pairs of wearable cotton panties per package for a fair price, so it's not all bad. But if the front of the package says ""COTTON"", ALL of the panties should be cotton."
2.0,"Not real happy...cracked at corner after couple weeks, didn't drop. Then today noticed another crack just down from orginal one...so a m I nth later 2 cracks in it, Not holding up very well in my opinion"
2.0,Fit weird wider than long. Not pink or rose more baby aspirin orange. Retuned
2.0,They run small.  My daughter is a size 6 toddler shoe and these just fit her feet.  I would recommend a size bigger.
2.0,Nice gloves just way too small.<br /><br />Constructed well and appealing to the eye.<br /><br />Would recommend ordering ordering at least one size up.
2.0,Wasn’t white but off white.
2.0,"It's a really beautiful dress, comfortable and i like the fabric. Could have easily been one of my favorites but unfortunately I've had it since not even 2 months (wore it maybe 5 times) and it is already pulling to the point where it looks like it has to go :("
2.0,It's just a black sack made of loose spandex that clings tightly to everything no matter how big or small the dress is.  It's bottom heavy and will drag the top down and down.  There's nothing really elegant about the dress.  It would make good under costuming tho.
2.0,They were like hip huggers<br />Returned them for a full refund
2.0,They were OK I wasn't a fan I like my others better
2.0,"Cute design but way too small especially torso length. Perhaps a smaller busted, shorter person would look good, but the torso length seemed cut more for a middle schooler than an adult woman."
2.0,Great if you want a one use wetsuit. My second time wearing it the seam ripped right down my butt crack.
2.0,They don't fit my ears
2.0,You get what you pay for. One set broke before I could even try it on.
2.0,both times the beard was missing. You tell a 5 year old SORRY... So I went out and paid $ 10.00 for one..
2.0,Fit runs very small. Make sure to size up when you order. I normally wear an x small or small in most items and the small did not fit at all.
2.0,"Not same dress in listing. I purchased Glamorstar's Women's Backless Sleeveless Straps Dress to wear as a sun/cocktail dress on my upcoming vacation to Cancun. When I opened the package, I was impressed with the thickness of the material, better quality than I expected.  The colors of the floral print were vibrant and bold, but not the same colors as in the listing nor the same floral print.  The purple is definitely lighter in the picture on the listing.  The floral print varies greatly from the listing as well.  The hem is nothing like the picture, the dress I received has a hem that is straight across, whereas the hem on the listing is curved, like the edge of flower petals.  See the pictures I post with this listing for comparison.  Disappointed that the listing does not accurately represent the product received.  I bought a small, I am dress size 2 to 4 and it fit my figure.  The skirt of this dress would definitely be considered a mini skirt.  Comes to mid thigh when standing straight.  This length I don't mind but with any movement  the hem rides up easily.  If you sit, bend, or walk with normal strides this thing will be above your waist in no time.  If you plan on dancing in this dress, be prepared for all your business to be showing because the dress will not stay down...my husband suggest wearing some cute undies :)  This dress is good for women with no intention on moving around much.  I received this dress at a discount in return for my fair and unbiased review.  I am under no obligation to leave a positive review or anything other than my own opinion.  The dress is cute, but just not for me, and not what was pictured."
2.0,Nice dress but doesnt really look like what the picture shows. It stretches so its bigger than expected.
2.0,The snap broke off the slipper the third time I put these on my two month.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Beautiful necklace but no opening for the pearl.
2.0,"Not as pictured. Colors are less vibrant and the white is very dingy looking. Different pattern. Gave it 2 stars though cause it does fit well. I wear a size 16 normally, 38DD, and an XL was a good size."
2.0,"I bought these because they were cute, but the quality was really bad. For the ones with lots of patterns, there were tons of threads in the socks that were uncomfortable. Plus they were very thin. I have thrown them out, but I suggest going with a little better quality."
2.0,It's ok. The material is very thin. I don't like to wear it because I feel like I need a camisole underneath it. It's too small to put one with it.
2.0,"First off from first glace when I got these pants, the pocket liners are made from two different types of material. One is the same material you would find as the liner of a party city princess dress. The other is just a cheap liner material. The 2nd thing wrong with these pants is that fact that it was made for someone who has no butt or thighs. So ladies and gentleman if you are blessed with some nice size thighs and a butt these wont work. If you are blessed with lean thighs and a smaller butt these might work."
2.0,This is NOT a cargo pants!! Cargo pants have leg side pockets. There were no side pockets on this pants. Just useless stiches. Its useless.
2.0,We’re too small
2.0,"There are 2 metal pieces that hold the glasses together. My son wanted these in his goody bags, for his birthday party, so bad. Went ahead and got them, but... always a but! They metal pieces weren't in half of them! They were all in pieces. I wasn't expecting to pay to have them shipped to me, to have to piece them back together. Some of them didn't even have the piece in the bag. I wasn't expecting to out more money out, because I bought enough that I would have needed. They are sturdy enough, so not sure why they wouldn't come properly put together, and have all the pieces in there at that! It's not something you can run and buy to replace. Yes, for the price, it was great. Then again, no matter what the price is, I think we can all agree we would love to get what we purchased! I definitely would not recommend buying these. Maybe from a different seller. Definitely a let down, for an adult, and an 8 year old, who usually has no clue. Unfortunately, he had to go through quite a few pairs just to find one he could try on, to play with, because he'd never seen them before. Just always in pictures and tv."
2.0,The detail beads broke in the packaging upon delivery. My daughter loves the concept but cheaply made. Don’t believe it will last long 😕
2.0,"I ordered the deep v neck jumpsuit in the smallest size available, and it’s huge! I am 5’6, 115 lbs and I was swimming in this. It looked like it could be cute when I tied it tight, but there was so much extra material that it bunched up allover. Same thing happened when I tightened the arm straps, there was so much material it created a huge gap in the back - so basically if your twice my size or are willing to get it taken in, I think it would be cute. I returned it, but may have exchanged it if there was an XXS."
2.0,I have been using this case for a little over one year and in terms of functionality it is fine. However I chose this one primarily for its clean aesthetics. Within about 8 months the plastic yellowed and it is now very discolored. We already have too much throwaway plastic so I will probably continue to use this one but I would not recommend it unless you enjoy the look of very discolored plastic.
2.0,"The shorts are nice and breathable, but the issue is the seams are falling apart and ripping. I bought two pairs but different colors and they both are coming apart."
2.0,Strange fit. Item returned
2.0,What I received was a phone strap and not a necklace. It still looks like the picture and is very nice but I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't what I thought.
2.0,"Unhappy with this shirt, the first thing I noticed was the printed logo is uneven which looks bad and noticeable to anyone, for the price I paid I actually thought I was getting a much better quality item, the logo is the most important part of this shirt, I could understand if it was a little off center but obviously there was no quality control, this shirt should have cost $10 instead of the $25 I paid"
2.0,"the dress i received is sewn crooked, one sleeve is bunched, and the breast seams don’t line up. the cut-outs at the bottom are extremely fragile.<br /><br />i washed and wore it once and it’s already tearing and coming unstitched. if you need something cheap and last-minute, even forever 21 dresses usually last longer."
2.0,"I'm 5'4, 120lbs, and it was very baggy; not a slim cut as the picture would lead you to believe."
2.0,Nice dress but it is much smaller then listed.
2.0,"Kind of disappointed. I bought this for my 3 year old nephew’s birthday because he loves baby shark & hats.<br />It says TODDLER hat in the product name & description. But when I received it, it’s a normal adult sized adult. So that sucks. It’s going to be too big for him. The way the picture is printed on looks kind of cheap as well, it’s really wrinkly looking around it.<br />4/10."
2.0,"I question if this is even authentic Eddie Bauer.  I have purchased many things from the brand in the past and they have been good/great quality.  Not this.  It was thin, barely any fill, and the sleeves were very short.  The size chart is also less-than-helpful.  Returned and will not re-purchase."
2.0,"It seemed rugged at first, but the sewing on the pocket starting to rip after the first week of use."
2.0,"Definitely nothing like the picture,  very thin material and does not look flattering"
2.0,Comfortable and super soft! But definitely NOT squat proof! Not workout leggings. Great for leisure wear though!
2.0,"Didn't write a review for many months bc I didn't have good things to say. I purchased the jacket bc of all the rave reviews I read. Soo misleading and perplexes me that people are actually pleased w this item. It arrives, I put it on and put my hands in the pocket, riiiip. Just casually trying it on and it ripped. I have it on while driving, it rips on the underarm. I am 5'6&#34; 122 lbs, average build, I purchased the extra large size for shoulder room and adequate arm length, so it ripping all over is not due to it being small. The seams are extremely fragile. The hood though is great."
2.0,"Ordered a size M to begin with.  Too tight.  Returned.  Ordered a size L (which I have never worn in my life).  As I expected, they were huge.  Returned those also.  Obviously, there isn't a size between a M and a L which is too bad, because the shorts are well made and I really liked the material (thus the 2 stars).  However, at this point, I give up.  Will find some other bike shorts!"
2.0,"I never knew that there was no pocket until I received it, but i'll use for a present"
2.0,pretty but doesn't close
2.0,Did not give me enough support
2.0,"Very nice at first, then after around 2 days they broke, I also noticed a scratched area when pulled out of package."
2.0,"What came was all dark, murky colors.  I was quite disappointed.  I realized it might not look like the picture, but it was pretty disappointing that it was so dark and murky.  It was a Christmas gift so I had to keep it."
2.0,"As I previously said, cute but much too long"
2.0,"I liked the tie die pattern so ordered it but the material is not great, so I am returning it.  I was hoping for a breathable material in cotton.  The size is as expected a little baggy fit.  Maybe if I don’t mind the material it’s a good buy for u."
2.0,"This dress is cute, but word to the wise- it is very very small. I ordered a large per sizing suggestions of seller....but it needs to be about 4 sizes larger. This dress is open in the front, closed via wrap around side tie. I was just barely fully covered. Any movement and my breasts came out. It was also really short. I like short- but this dress is excessively short to the point where not only can you not bend in any way, you can't even squat or anything as an alternative because again- everything shows. Lesson- order this dress a few sizes up."
2.0,Did not fit as expected. Size M is not US M.  Can get a better price for the same shirt
2.0,Very pretty but fit is not true to size. Reminds me why I don't do online shopping =\
2.0,"NO PONGA RETORNO SIN COSTO , HAY QUE QUE PAGAR EL CORREO DE LA DEVOLUCION , QUE ES LO QUE NO COBRAR<br />EL DEVOLVERLO  MEJOR PONGA SE PUEDE DEVOLVER PERO DEBE DE PAGAR LA DEVOLUCION"
2.0,"The zippers are very sharp and will cut you, they also get stuck. I'm not sure if I got a bad one or if this is a common problem. If it wasmt for the zipper I would be very happy with the fit and style."
2.0,"Maybe I’m missing something here because I don’t understand the positive reviews. The part the pins go through is great and can be placed through the correct holes to best hang the pin. But the bail you’d put your necklace through is way, way too small for me to put on any normal necklace. Only one reviewer even mentioned it as an issue. Any tips?"
2.0,Oversized and overpriced.
2.0,"These water shoes wreak of synthetic chemicals. I've had them for a few months now, and I've been attempting to air them out before my daughter wears them, but they are still very pungent!"
2.0,I loved how the chokers looked but the ones with the clamps instantly broke after I opened the package. Not satisfied with this brand at all and I will not be ordering again
2.0,Shorty shorts... had to return
2.0,The ring looked nice but the quality is lacking. The ring was delivered to me and some of the stones were missing so I was quite disappointed. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting something that's better quality.
2.0,Too small it rolled up on me!!!! Mad I really needed this!!!
2.0,"This is HUGE on me. If you're actually a small, this is NOT going to work! I know it's supposed to be oversize, but it looks nothing like the picture on me.  Hang weird, sleeves are weird. Fabric is also not that nice."
2.0,"I would have given it 5 stars but it was missing one of the large rhinestones in front.  It was very obvious, I feel like the seller should have noticed this when packing the item for shipment.  Unfortunately I didn’t open it until I had to use it and couldn’t do anything about it at that time.  It’s a beautiful crown and the quality is nice but beware it might arrive with missing rhinestones which totally stinks!"
2.0,I have worn this ring 3 times and its already turning my finger green. I will return this. Pretty ring. Big stone.
2.0,"I thought the material would be more cotton like. It’s very thin and shows all wrinkles. Also, didn’t fit according to the sizing chart."
2.0,"Cute ornament and original concept, but you can see the white paint flaking off the face mask. Disappointed that it’s flaking off. Not packaged very well either."
2.0,The clasp was broken when I got it.  Didn't bother to return it. It's pretty but not sterling silver.  It's a cute piece of costume jewelry.
2.0,Buckles are too large for my taste.  The belt doesn't stay tight -- loosens up quite easily.
2.0,"GREAT JACKET I MEAN GREAT JACKET How ever the stitching of the logo was poor on both attempts that's right I ORDERED  IT 2 TIMES 2nd one was a little bit better but not buy much now just for fun if you were to tag on the  jacket- 4X - WORLD CHAMPS - ALSO MAYBE AN  XL would be nice , be glad to send you my money 3rd time if you can correct the stitching problem"
2.0,"The bendable nose piece is very effective but has quickly started poking through the fabric—OUCH! It’s very sharp. This is unfortunate, because the mask itself is very soft and substantial."
2.0,"Much thinner than I was expecting. It is chiffon, which is nice, very nice if you want something that adds a little something to your outfit. Does not help for warmth, but the print makes up for it."
2.0,Cheaply made good night
2.0,Stitching was crooked so I returned
2.0,The material feels like nightgown or Halloween costume material. It is the type of fabric that will snag super easy. The elastic is thin and is twisted in the casing (subpar sewing). I wanted an elegant easy to wear dress for a cruise but this dress is not made well. The straps are very long but they are not sewn far enough to the sides to give modest coverage. No matter how I tied it there was a gap that exposed my side boob. I considered some double sided tape but I would rather spend more $ on a better quality dress. Very cheap. Maybe good cover up for the beach but not a dress to wear out.
2.0,"I ordered these for my 12 year old daughter; she is about 57"" tall and 70 pounds; typically wears size 12 slim or youth large 10/12. We ordered these tank tops in size small and overall they fit. They have an adjustable ring on the strap, but there is nowhere for the excess strap to thread through when adjusting. There is a loop sewn around it, making actually adjusting the length impossible. I will probably cut them apart and rework them make them adjust properly, but it's annoying to have to do this. I'm only keeping them because this is the third product I've ordered in an attempt to find a decent camisole for a pre-teen girl."
2.0,Super sad.  So I apparently have &#34;muscular calves&#34;  and although the main part of this is knit and stretchy...the fur cuff is static.  So I will be able to wear them with ankle boots but not the higher ones. I gave one pair to my daughter and she loves them and could probably wear them on her thigh...poor me.
2.0,A bit see through.
2.0,i didnt like how it works
2.0,Great product. But it doesn’t hold up.
2.0,These were so small for a size 12 foot that they cut off circulation on the top of my foot at the opening
2.0,"I do love the look of this ring, but it has already dropped a pearl and I've only had it 1 week.  Disappointed!"
2.0,My boyfriend ordered these for me i love them but you will definitely have to alter the bottom of the pants because you wont see any leg otherwise unless you have very big legs from you calf on down
2.0,"When I first put these on I loved them. BUT within minutes on my ears, they were entangled up. I untangled them, then they became entangled again. There's no point in getting a pair of earrings like this, if they don't stay the way they should look. Sent back. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"I ended up donating this purse even though I really liked it initially.  The problem is that because the bag is so soft, the zipper often gets stuck when you are trying to close it. Furthermore, zipper is not attached to the bag all the way around, which also increases the difficulties in closing it especially with one hand.  Because the material is so soft, the purse also hangs at a slightly odd angle depending on whether or not you have a phone in the front pocket, and it just doesn’t look very nice if you do."
2.0,"Beautiful product. Unfortunately, it broke the same day."
2.0,"Great teal color, but it's so short compared to my other 2 that I have ordered from you.  My other ones are long to my knees and this one goes to the hip.  You should really put that in the description."
2.0,"Band is well built and color is solid a vibrant. Installation onto the Samsung Gear 3 Frontier is forward and easy. One small problem. This watch bad stinks...no, not in the sense of it sucks, but it stinks, as in smell. It's a cross between a chemical and the smell of burnt electronics. No matter what I do to it, I can't get rid of the smell. Now you might  be saying, well it's on your wrist, who cares if it stinks. Well here is where it's going to raise its' ugly head. While you're sleeping you're going to put your hands under your head or tuck them under your pillow, and yes, it's going to wake you up because you're going to think something is on fire or that someone has broken into your house and is trying to chloroform you and steal your soul (If you're a ginger, you don't have to worry about this because as we all know, gingers' have no soul)."
2.0,"The colors are true to the picture and the length is decent (I’m 5’7) but the shirts are shiny and slick. They don’t grip, they ride up."
2.0,little to small......
2.0,I could not use these as they are too small.  But I will offer them to another nurse.
2.0,GREAT STYLE - MUCH SMALLER THAN CHART
2.0,Good looking watch but the band is so stiff that it becomes unconformable to wear! If it had a different band this watch would get 5 Stars...
2.0,"I have these leggings in black, red and now blue. The red and black ones were great! The blue ones though were not! They were so uneven. One leg was a perfect fit and the other leg was so tight I could barely squeeze into it. I was able to put them on all the way and they felt so tight but only ONE leg. I got a size medium, which is the same size I’ve gotten on the other colors too. They were also see through which was disappointing because the other two colors were not. I’m planning on returning these and getting my money back or hopefully an exchange for a good pair."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:bfd63063cf073a103727d10f2bdaaa66]] First, let me start of with the good aspects of this watch winder. The case itself is gorgeously constructed. It's solid, has a good weight to it, the ebony wood coloring is beautiful, and the latch on the top is securely holds the front access shut. Inside, the surfaces are covered with a suede-like material with no apparent seams. My first impression upon taking the winder out of the box it shipped in was &#34;oh, wow.&#34; I was not expecting it to look quite as good as it did for the price. Additionally, there's little to no play in the motor housings, make it easy to attach and detach watches from the winder.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were some issues with the unit that I couldn't overlook. The biggest problem - and the reason I returned the winder - was that the power connector assembly on the unit had a loose connection. This meant that anytime I moved the winder, it lost power. Because the winder digitally controlled, this meant I would lose all of my settings and have to reprogram it. Hopefully this is just a sign of a defective unit, and not an overarching issue with Belocia winders.<br /><br />Next, the unit was noisy. It started off quiet, but within a matter of days, the winder developed substantial motor noise, as demonstrated in the video posted. I will note though, that without the power supply issues, the noise wasn't enough to get me to return the unit. I seep with a fan on, which provided enough white noise for me to sleep through the noises of the winder. With the fan off though, I could always hear the unit whenever it turned on.<br /><br />The LCD display and interface isn't great. It's not too difficult to figure out (though the poorly-written instructions aren't much better than trial-and-error), but you can't just walk up to the unit and immediately figure out how to set it up and operate it. Additionally, the display is almost illegible unless viewed from directly overhead. Like the winder noise, these issues would be more or less fine if I could count on the unit staying on as long as it was plugged in. The difficulty presented in reading the display only made the power issues more frustrating, as it wasn't readily apparent when the unit lost power.<br /><br />Finally, there is one issue with the design of the winder that did make me somewhat nervous as a watch owner. The watch mounts are somewhat clumsily designed. They apply substantial spring tension to the watchband to hold it in place, but getting a watch into the winder is a careful dance of holding down the spring loaded parts of the mount and sliding the watch into place. There is no latch/deploy mechanism like on Heiden winders. I'm sure I would have figured out the trick to the mounting system and this would be a negligible comment, but given the power issues, winder noise, and LCD quality, the watch mounts were simply another source of frustration with the unit.<br /><br />In the end, I am disappointed to say that I am returning the unit. I had high hopes which were only bolstered by my first impressions, but was ultimately let down by the overall quality of the watch winder."
2.0,Wouldn’t buy again. Daughter lost a stone on the first day
2.0,"A cute watch, but the strap broke on the first use"
2.0,Cool concept except my son's shoes stopped working after 3 days and recharging them 2 times. 😑
2.0,"Just had breast reduction done, this looked very similar to my surgery bra.  So tried it on felt good but no good support on shoulders or sides."
2.0,The quality is not what I expected and vendor doesn't respond to respond. Returns and refunds are challenging.
2.0,It's exactly what's in the picture but very cheaply made. I won't even wear it because it looks so cheap....
2.0,"Did not wash well, said machine wash, washed gentle on cold, inside never filled back in, now back of jacket has no filling!  Dryer with tennis balls like most instructions say, still nothing :-("
2.0,Super cute but the clasp is faulty. Does not stay securely closed. It is also hard to completely remove as it gets “hooked”
2.0,"Perfect size for id,creditcard, keys, lip gloss, powder, small lotion, little cash and such. Meant more for the 20 something crowd but could be ageless. The zipper works great but the buckle/button frame came off quickly somewhere and is unfixable. The cost to send back makes it not worth it so I am stuck with the purchase. I will find some other use for it. Possibly give to my niece."
2.0,It is a thin material. Doesn’t hold in the boob area... not much support. Had to return.
2.0,Ordered 3 sizes up and it's still too small!
2.0,so uncomfortable I only tried them on then took them off immediately..the leather is so hard.
2.0,Color is not as shown a little disappointed but I won't return it.
2.0,it was too small to properly cover nose and mouth like in picture. The metal piece for nose was a ok feature but shifted around in mask. Gave to young grandchild to wear. Wouldn't buy again or recommend for adult use due to size
2.0,There is nothing about this that makes cleaning shoes any easier. It does the same thing as what soap and water does I don’t see it going the extra mile. My shoes aren’t extra whiter or cleaner. I don’t think it is worth the price at all
2.0,I not like
2.0,"very thick band, wording came off"
2.0,After having this product for a week the front came apart after opening it to get my credit card out ripped at the seams where your ID goes.
2.0,These are not waterproof which is an obvious must have for snowboarding. The boa is great though.
2.0,"This item arrived quickly but it just didn't work the way I'd hoped it would. My husband said it actually seemed to make my snoring worse. So, the search continues."
2.0,Good size but omg the strap is so loose it’s nit normal had to buy Velcro and redo
2.0,"The jeans fit fine, and the material helps smooth things out, however all but one of the belt loops came off as soon as I was pulling these on (no, not too tight, they just weren't sewn on at all). Frustrating that I already have to fix these before wearing them."
2.0,"The bathing suit itself was very cute and I had no problems at all with the style, colors, material, etc. However, the fit was not at all as expected. I ordered a small bathing suit (I normally wear a size 4 in bottoms and a size small in tops). The top fit great, looked good on me, and was stretchy and comfortable, but I couldn't even get the bottoms up past my hips; it wasn't stretchy at all. I would definitely want to buy this bathing suit, but only if I could get a different size top and bottoms, which the seller informed me they did not do because they only sell both pieces together and in the same size."
2.0,This is made small and it was sent in XL and I ordered a 2XL
2.0,"Smashes breast, no support, its a t-shirt.Dont"
2.0,"Runs small, cheap silky material"
2.0,Thought it was for computer
2.0,"I got these for my husband because he works outside (aircraft mechanic) and gets cold in the winter time in just his work trousers. Might as well not have. They are not thicker or warmer than any other pair he owns, and they were pricey for one pair. To be fair, he did say they were very comfortable and the fabric quality is great, but they did nothing to add an extra layer of warmth, and for the money I'd never buy them again just for the comfort factor."
2.0,The skeleton ones do not glow in the dark.
2.0,Little bit tight fit and to long.  Quality OK but definitely tight around the thighs.
2.0,"The watch came much later then expected and missed my two week hiking trip.<br />The watch keeps time; the compass points North; temperature looks about right; whistle makes sound.<br />Cons:<br />Temperature is in Celsius<br />Battery doesn't appear to be replaceable<br /><br />Update:<br />Watch is not water resistant. How is a so called &#34;Survival Watch&#34; not water resistant? I went into the river, so the watch was submerged at most 2 feet; and it is filled with water..."
2.0,The quality and fabric of these pants are not worth the price tag. You can find this same pant at Old Navy or Target for $20. Very disappointed in this pant and ended up returning it.
2.0,Es muy claro<br />Se ven los pantis la tela es muy fina
2.0,"This was too small!! The material is great, nice coverage and stretches but order a size up!!"
2.0,Was very disappointed in the fit. I went by their size chart and the bra is probably 2 sizes smaller than I need. No way it is XL. Front snaps come unsnapped throughout the day. The only thing that was nice was the feel of the fabric across the back
2.0,"The shoe is fine, although slightly different than the picture. It isn’t as sturdy as it appears. The pink flower decoration around the heel and toe came off in less than 2 weeks. These should be $9.99 or less based on the quality."
2.0,I hate this sports bra.  I will not even wear it to bead as a sleep bra.  There is not enough give or space in the fabric at the front of the bra to keep you boobs inside the bra. Putting on this bra feels like putting on equipment.  This is the first time I can say that I feel like a bra oppressed me! Horrible.
2.0,"Barely held up in wash the first time I washed it.  Very thin, cheap material.  The deep charcoal color is definitely not black.  See-through.  Pockets are good."
2.0,The images were blurred and the socks rolled down leg really easily.
2.0,These are really expensive for what you get.  I have seen similar items from Walmart under $5.
2.0,I don’t know what the purpose of compressions socks really are… But I have bad veins in my legs so I thought that I would give it a try. I know that these are supposed to be tight… but I really don’t think that the purpose is to cut off all circulation to the point my foot falls asleep. I ordered these in different sizes and the boys were so tight it took two people to try to get them on and we still couldn’t even get them on their feet. I was no impressed. I will saw that the quality of the sock is good. Just way to tight.
2.0,"This skirt was pretty much what I expected it to be, but it was unflattering on me. I wore it with a shiny top to a formal event & felt like the broad side of a barn. I had to pull it way up high under my bust to keep it from being too long. Not a good buy for me."
2.0,Seems rubber breaks after a short time
2.0,The jeans are very nice but were not good for my body type. They were baggy in the lower half of the behind and the legs were baggy. Had to return them.
2.0,"Received one of two sweaters I ordered today.  The light grey is pretty , good color.  Fit is ok, I'm a 8/10 but ordered a small since several reviews suggested to size down and since my short I thought the small would be a better look.  Now for the sad news.  I know $25 isn’t terribly expensive for a sweater however I think it’s a little much for the quality.  It appears that my sweater arms have been  assembled wrong side out.  Of course it’s always a given Amazon clothes are ALWAYS hit or miss.  This one will go back. The black one gets delivered tomorrow maybe it will look better."
2.0,Too small<br />Still haven’t received a replacement. It has been months
2.0,WAY TOO PINK
2.0,TOO LARGE!!!  NON RETURNABLE!!!
2.0,I had to return it. I have no problems with oversized sweaters but this one has a super ugly and awkward fit to it. It was extremely unflattering. Lol I give it two starts because the quality of the fabric was kind of nice.
2.0,"Not sure why the description says ""stretchy cotton"". It's polyester and spandex, which is fine, only it is a pinchy and non-cooling fabric. Not comfortable."
2.0,TO BIG  THE EAR PART
2.0,"My son had lost a similar water shoe in the ocean at the beach, so I got these hoping the velcro would help, but I could not get it tight enough, plus the velcro is not that strong. I was able to take them off his feet way too easily. I ended up getting one with an elastic tie."
2.0,"This is very pretty dress, but its it's very small in the bust area. If you have large breast you have a hard time with this dress."
2.0,Product is a thin workout sweatshirt which is nice but it is sized way smaller than advertised.  I usually run a medium in almost everything but a medium in this doesn’t even come close to fitting like it should.
2.0,"Really pretty but it feels like a Halloween dress, I was hoping for a better quality."
2.0,Good fabric but too small for adults
2.0,"Size10 is hard to fit so I was excited to order these. Love the color but they are about size 11 and would not be good for vigorous wear. OK for walking and gardening, would not wear running. Perfect for size 11 or 12."
2.0,I think they are made small considering the size i orderd to what i wear. But they were very nice material and style.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this shirt, based on all the positive reviews it had. I usually get an XL in shirts but this one was too big. And while a large might have fit better overall, the arm holes were the worst part. They were way too big and left a big gap where you could see my bra on the sides. I dont see a smaller size making that better. The graphic also wasnt what I thought it would be. It was very plastic feeling and way more vibrant when I was expecting a more worn ""vintage"" look. Gonna have to return it."
2.0,"They are ok, but the didn't come with the back parts yo hold the earrings on my ears."
2.0,Hardly fitted like it’s advertised. They’re huge and make my legs look like pencils. And my legs aren’t that skinny. Disappointed. And the color doesn’t look like it was advertised
2.0,"The wallet is brown bit it's a lot darker than the picture. Also, the wallet does not open all the way flat when open to put cash in the pockets. The ID slot is very tight. I almost thought I couldn't get it inside. I'm looking for a replacement."
2.0,The glasses feel real cheap.  The comfort pieces around the nose area are crooked so the glasses look crooked when you put them on.  I thought that I would be able to bend them and make them work but that made it worst.
2.0,"No me gusto, la elástica de la cintura se dobla"
2.0,Cute pattern... great padding... however like most shorts... i have larger thighs.. and these squeezed the life out of them and made them look bigger... so if they would learn to relax the tightness at the bottom i would've loved them.
2.0,"I've bought 4 pairs of these  capris/pants in this brand before and have always loved them... these seem thin. The waist is not stretchy, it seemed like it was not an elastic or spandex fabric, it seems like a thin string... fine enough, hopefully I won't be in this size long."
2.0,I ordered the 10mm size ones but got 8mm.<br />The plugs are preatty good but unfortunately I would not be able to use them
2.0,Too small and the buckle doesn't lay flat.
2.0,"I love the screen and it what it says, but I do not like that the cover part that goes around the tire. It faded in the 1st month and now the black color does not match."
2.0,"I should've taken the advice of the others who posted about this dress.  The top portion of the dress is flim flammy.....doesn't fit well, tried adjusting the straps and it was still too loose.  My daughter is 5.4""  w/ a 34C top.  As she put it, too much side boob showed.  The material and color was perfect tho."
2.0,I’d like it but I ordered a small medium band it’s large I have to put it on the tightest hole🙁
2.0,"the dress style is pretty. i loved how light it felt but not enough to keep it because it feels cheaply made, it also feels so thin that although i bought a dark color, i feel like it is so thin to almost sheer, poor quality. i was disappointed because i was really looking forward to wearing this dress. it looks so cure online."
2.0,These were really cheap and lightweight.  Not strong enough for kids to play with.
2.0,I Am a true size 6 this fits a 16 year old
2.0,this isn't the shirt I received. my was too small and just different. ewww
2.0,Huge for a average man's wrist. Inaccurate size description but otherwise it's nice.
2.0,"This sweater is warm and soft, but it fits me like a tent. I'm 5'6&#34; and 150 lbs, and the large I got could fit two of me in it. It's looks like an Eskimo maternity sweater. Excuse me...Inuit maternity sweater. It also hangs weird in the front."
2.0,The pendant portion is lovely. The necklace came so tangled I have contemplated ripping it off and putting a different chain with the stone just so I can wear it. I gave 2 stars for the pendant since it is lovely.<br /><br />I am highly disappointed
2.0,"I cannot believe these were $60! They're completely hollow, sound like tinfoil, and weigh absolutely nothing. They look adorable from afar, but I cannot believe how cheaply constructed they are!"
2.0,just a bit overdone and the cells made it feel like a bunch of buttons were pressing down on your shoulder.
2.0,Cheap. Bend easily.
2.0,This is not a cotton sweatshirt as described. It is satin type cooling material very easy to snag and no warmth. Not as expected.
2.0,The waste is way too tight
2.0,Too small.  Order 2 sizes bigger if you want it to fit.
2.0,I ended up giving it away because it was actually a size xxxs instead of a xxxL. The material  was of good quality
2.0,"love the shoe but Can't wear the shoe because, it doesn't fit. Don't know how to get it changed."
2.0,"The bands themselves seem fine, but all the connecting pieces are really cheap plastic. Don't trust your watch with this"
2.0,"This review isn't necessarily for the boot but for the seller, the boot shown here is apparently discontinued, instead of contacting me to discuss other options on a $120pr of boots I get sent a cigar brown which is fine but with reinforced toe which doesn't stretch to fit as several other Redback/bluetongue I've purchased in the past 10yrs I've worn these boots. Needless to say I went ahead & kept the boots to see if maybe I could manage the toe & of course I blister up due to the solid reinforcement....  It sux!<br />IF YOU WANT A GREAT PAIR OF BOOTS THAT ARE EASY ESCAPE & LAST FOREVER & FORM TO YOUR FOOT BUY REDBACK NON-REINFORCED & A HALF SIZE SMALLER. Tough it out on break-in, you do not want your foot to slide or move once boot is on..<br />My secret is once you receive your new .5 smaller put them on ""you'll think too small"" submerge entire boot under water on your feet crouch down move feet around & stretch the leather.  Now the uncomfortable part, try & let them dry on your feet. This is hard cause it takes time & prunny feet suck.  Stay out of dirt, mud ect.  Once completely dry & clean of any dirt layer the boot with mink oil several times once has absorbed few applications wipe off any excess & boot is ready to wear & use & now is completely water proof up to the elastic.  I usually wear about half a day for a week until I forget there on my feet. I wear mine about 12-18hrs a day 365days & they last about 3yrs before I start considering next pair.  This does work.<br />*If you buy your regular size & not .5 smaller they tend to stretch past your size then you have a loose boot & me personally isn't a good thing or feeling.."
2.0,underneath the nose hole  no protection
2.0,Dissapointed with the pearl being flat on one side. Otherwise OK for the price. I returned it.
2.0,This product is stunning to look at yet broke with the first use. Clasp feel right off within moments of wearing. Disappointed.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, it fit me really well, but I ordered it twice and both dresses had 2 panels off the butterflies upside down when the rest were right side up. I wouldn’t have minded if they were all upside down and right side up but one panel in the back being a different direction really bothered me. Sadly I will he returned both and I’m afraid to try again."
2.0,Fits fine. The design though is NOT what u recieve. I could have made my own leggings had I known that their image was a false advertising design. I’m really not happy about it since I won’t be wearing them cause they look so NOT like what is shown.
2.0,"I was not loving this shirt, I sent it back.  It is super long, and the neckline is very low.  The quality of the shirt seemed fine, just not the fit."
2.0,"I bought these for my bed and breakfast and they are very thick, bulky, and stiff.  The fabric itself has a soft finish, but they don't drape, they almost could stand up by themselves!  I have bought other robes from this brand that were very nice, but no longer available."
2.0,Very thin fabric and too short.
2.0,"My dress came in today and it is VERY long (drags the ground long, I’m 5”3’) and VERY thin. The print is cute but the material is not at all what I expected, it’s a more silky and see through polyester. If you buy it be aware, you’ll want a full length slip (costumers before me said a tank top would do because the top is see through, but the bottom is just as sheer) and you will most likely need to take it up and hem it. Also, shipping takes a long time. It’s cute but not what I expected, I probably wouldn’t recommend the order if a friend asked my opinion."
2.0,Not awful but not as cute as the picture
2.0,Way to big. It's to much of pain to return so gave it away.
2.0,The Olymbros Single Automatic Watch Winder works well. It is quiet and keeps my Tag and Rolex running very well. It is a decent looking case. The foam pads that hold the watches are cheaply made. They started to deteriorate after two weeks of use.  I will return if Olymbros will not replace the pads
2.0,"I really do like the suit. The bottoms fit perfectly, they are cheeky bottoms though so if you don't like that then don't buy this suit. However, the top looks different than the picture... As in there's basically nothing to it. It barely cover my nipple... There's just no material. Also it was almost impossible to tighten it from the back because of the way it cross crosses it only tightens so much. It was very see through, and you could see the pads and it looked so awkward... So I had to remove them."
2.0,Too small . Nice color
2.0,"I know these are all natural but there are a lot of imperfections in these, as has been the case with all cultured pears I received from them.  I would have returned them if I could but they were purchased ahead of time as a Christmas gift and by the time they were opened, it was too late.  Disappointed in the quality...."
2.0,"Too small in some areas-too big in others, just now cut well for me."
2.0,At least it was expensive. Not at all what i thought it would be.<br />1.The lace atound the edges was just straight cut leaving lots of treads out. 2. Zipper sucks and wont move past a certain point. 3. Under skirt isnt how its discribed in photos. Its double layered and ment to frame an hour glass shape but the top lace was sewed wrong so it bubbles out. 4. Again the lace that over hangs is bluntly cut with no design in mind. 5. The bottom of the longest layer has lace on it as well which causes the top layers tl hang weird. Not flowing 6. Top bust area is size to me but this dress style wasnt ment for someone that is endowed. 7.?Shoulder straps will break im sure of it. Very thin material badly sewn together.<br /><br />Most of it seems fixable with a good seamstress but unhappy with the lack of  description.<br /><br />Delevery was also a week later then the original tracking number  anticipated. And then was delivered one day late after it was updated.
2.0,"Ripped in 3 spots ,after  a few years,cheap material"
2.0,"Everything about these is slippers is great, EXCEPT the foam liner/footbed in the bottom keeps sliding up and out of the slipper when being worn. With how active little kids are, the liner has to be sealed to the bottom of the slipper. I tried them on my son and within 10 min the liner was coming out. For this reason we have to return these."
2.0,"Not as pictured... it is an odd metal, looks like it was made in a cheap pour mold, it has sharp metal shards on the edges, and sticks when trying to open and close..."
2.0,"Pretty, but very small for size."
2.0,Broke almost as soon as I got it. It fell off my wrist and I lost it.
2.0,"This bag is quite a bit smaller then the measurements shown. The width is about 10.75” but they show 13.3”.  The handles are 8” when they say 9.4” and the bag itself is just shy of 14” when they show 14.5”.  The lining is also different then shown in the photos.  It’s not a bad bag, but I was looking for something larger for the price.  The zipper also seems flimsy and based on other reviews it doesn’t hold up well, so skeptical of that as well."
2.0,"Colors are off from pictured, fit is very loose, fabric is NOT COTTON as described....fabric is shiny and mostly polyester with only 35% cotton...most disappointed. Will keep and wear for a nightgown, which is what it looks like. Back to sewing my own clothes!"
2.0,"Like the item, but shippie sucked....8-10 days past due date"
2.0,I was hoping for better results. I just went out and bought a new bra.
2.0,"Really great design. Super convenient to put keys on and take out of your pocket. Would be 5 stars except the leather piece, which is held in place by a tiny screw, fell off within a month of daily use."
2.0,The left front stitches came off the day I received this hat.
2.0,"These stretched out pretty quickly, still wearing them but only until i buy Something different."
2.0,"Aside from the size running small, I was hoping for a better quality product. The material is thinner than I prefer and the craftsmanship is not of the highest quality either.<br />Thank you."
2.0,"The graphics on these boxers are pretty spot on, however, this pair runs SUPER small!  I got a Large, which should be a size 36--however, this appears to be much smaller.  I fear how much it will shrink after being washed!  I got this as a gag gift for my 27 year old son, but he won't be able to use them at all due to the size chart being so far off!  If you are considering buying this, I would seriously recommend ordering two sizes up.  Would have been a better gag gift if he could actually wear these...which he would have!<br /><br />*** My opinions are my own and we're not influenced by the seller in anyway.

2.0,"Great materials, well constructed, reasonably priced, sizing is close to right but the torso portion is way too tight. I ordered a size up as I always do with neoprene garments and no I am not chubby 32 waist. Just a shame so tight around the diaphragm area. Maybe the manufacturer has some stretching tips? Sure would like to keep this."
2.0,"For one, I ordered a small, I got a large. I don’t have b**bs, so it hangs way too low. 2, the bow is super cheap, and just a clothing pin looped through the back and it falls off super easily. It came with everything said and came earlier than expected, but I can barely use the outfit and I’m not happy at all."
2.0,Buyer beware get a bigger size the insulation is very thick and makes hard to use tools or grab things
2.0,They look pretty however have no protection at all. Not solid material with lots of holes. This mask is for looks only.
2.0,these were a lot smaller than expected. like A LOT smaller. there were no previous reviews to go off of and there are no size comparison photos with these earrings so they were returned directly after receiving them.
2.0,"Pretty comfortable, quick delivery.  However the stitching is average and the tongue on the right slipper was missing."
2.0,Everywhere fits fine except across the chest and a little in the shoulder. WAAY to tight. Gave it to a friend.
2.0,Pretty dress but very tight on the top and short. I’m 5’4” and it just covered my butt. I have a B cup and it was way too tight up top.
2.0,this runs 2 full sizes small
2.0,Colors faded significantly after a single wash.
2.0,Nice fabric. Too baggy around lower abd and thighs and too long.
2.0,practically doesn't stay on - and it hurts when it does.  am returning.
2.0,Fits on a much younger child. I had to return it.
2.0,"Cute in the picture. I’m sure it fits other people (tinnier, less busty) better. It fit, but not well! LOL! It is thin material and of course China made. Man, online shopping is rough!"
2.0,Returned because didnt like the fit.
2.0,"I bought a 3 pack of these 6 months ago.  They initially look great but after 2-3 months, the finish rubs off.  I have also developed a rash from wearing it.  The finish should last longer than 2-3 months and a 3 pack should obviously last longer than 6 months."
2.0,I'm a 36C with a wide back. I think the sizes run small. So size up. The bra itself felt and looked great.
2.0,Not happy with quality of shirt - returning
2.0,"i had purchased size XL previously and they were too short so I went with the XXL for my hubby , there is no difference in size."
2.0,"The hooded is cute, but not true to size. I ended up buying a different one from Illinois online store."
2.0,Glasses are not for adults.  Extremely small
2.0,Listed as mens but fit more like boys!  Tried to return but unable d/t covid so only refunded 1/2 and left with the shirt.  They were polite and returned correspondence timely.
2.0,I regularly wear a Large and bought a XXL. The shirt was tight and the neck part was a bit awkward and the cross cross was way to lose! I had to cut IT them off.
2.0,Looked cheaply made and wasn't that nice
2.0,This is not for a man! It looks like a woman’s top when I tried it on. I have them to my wife.
2.0,This skirt runs small and is also pretty short.  The part I really disliked was the distressing on the butt area.  Overall it looked cheap
2.0,"So these are a cute design, good color, and actually pretty comfortable, but one of them is made wrong and there’s no way to fix it. The strap is twisted where it goes through the metal decoration thing and not attached properly to the shoe which completely ruins them."
2.0,"The style is flattering if you have wide hips. Otherwise, looks like you are wearing this paperbag. The feel is horrible and the it sounds like you are walking around in a trash bag or clothes made out of paper."
2.0,Well my experience with this purchase was not as expected. First I order one with brown outside and tan on the inside...I received one tan on the outside and brown on the inside. The add specify that it is 25% wool 75% acrylic...the tag on the item says it is 100% acrylic.<br /><br />Other than that...it looks good and fit me fine.
2.0,I love it but the color is stripping 🥺
2.0,FADE FADE FADE
2.0,"nice, but really small - the XXXL is more like a large"
2.0,Did not fit like shown in pictures. Was way too short for my liking. Also the material was very cheap.
2.0,I was expecting more absorbency but is mediocre at best.  At least it holds the hair in place.
2.0,"Nose piece is terrible, you can't see straight underwater.  I've now learned to beware of Amazon Lightning Deals."
2.0,Arrived folded creased and missing decorate on the side. It took a long time to get here and really looks so bad I cab imagine giving it as a gift. Very disappointed.
2.0,"They are big size, beware that if you buy them you'll receive XXXL, useless."
2.0,The pants don't fit all that good. I ordered medium. The bottom part of the legs were extra tight and the waistband is loose and doesn't stay up that well. I think the material is a little thin and also the jack-o-lantern face on the butt is off center. I wanted to return them but I couldn't get the return label to give me a print option so I guess I'll donate them.  Really cute pants though.
2.0,Cheaply made but ok for the summer! Color is just like the picture.
2.0,"Loved it....at first. I noticed a seam coming undone the first and only time that I wore it. I sewed it, then later noticed a long &quot;run&quot; in the sleeve. I was at work and could not fix it until I  got home. So very disappointed."
2.0,These shirts run VERY SMALL
2.0,"The bust is tiny and the arms are SO short. Also, the pretty &#34;dusty lavender&#34; in the picture is more like garish light purple/blue in person. But a size up AND a different color. Fabric and length were nice."
2.0,The material was very poor.  The skirt went back.
2.0,"Way too small and short. The label said large but, the design wasn’t the same in the picture and it didn’t seem to be the right fit even for someone who was large and petite (I ordered regular with my measurements according to the size chart). Even the chest area was way off for the required chest measurements for a regular large. At least it came on time and the color was as pictured.<br /><br />Had to return :("
2.0,"Had to return it, too wide. I love the print though"
2.0,"These are too short!  I really like the stretchyness and comfort of the fabric, but the length is too short.  I will be returning them."
2.0,"It's all good except for the neck line. It feels like I'm being choked.  Should of returned, but since I did not.I might try cutting the neck into a v-neck"
2.0,"The size stated girls, I wanted them for a three year old. Way to big!"
2.0,This product was beautiful how ever they are way too big for a normal size head and face. I am a 30 Yr old woman and I really wanted these to fit. Unfortunately they are way too big and fall down when I move my mouth or nose at all
2.0,"The material’s great, and I love all the pockets and compartments, but the straps are so slippery they won’t stay on my shoulders. Also, after only 2 months of minimum use the zipper stitching has come undone. I also find the straps adjustment awkward.<br />The bag is truly waterproof and great in the rain, and I wish I had a rain jacket made of this stuff, but the bag is mediocre."
2.0,Great timing on shipping. But &#34;one side&#34; is really like an x-large. Hoping it will shrink.
2.0,Cute pants not good quality ripped after 2 wears.
2.0,Several of the CZs dropped out within several weeks. Would've been good otherwise.
2.0,cheap material and it gave me infection.
2.0,"This dress is beautiful, sewn great, zipper is small and very noticeable but the sizing is SO WRONG!  I’m large breasted and have learned to order larger! (Easier to take up!). However this zipper was literally on both sides of my back!  No possible way it would zip and I ordered up to an XXLarge.<br />  I’m so bummed as I need this to wear in 4 days to lead a little girls Girl Scout Tea Party!<br />Heartbroken that the sizing is not just off its wrong! .<br />Waist was big but felt great on!  (A couple inches to big but I accounted for that and was gonna see it up). )"
2.0,They do not stay on glasses
2.0,Pesima calidad
2.0,"I order a bigger size beccause I wanted to be shown under my other shirt, but in stead it was to tight on my body and kept rolling up. It's just hanging up in the closest for now. I can't even were it."
2.0,"They SUCK! But really, they fit well and are comfortable...except...for this darn plastic smell that we could smell before we even opened the box. We let them air out for over 1 month on our open-air covered back porch and it's better, but still there. You decided if they are worth the price of admission."
2.0,This is definitely not lint free. I cannot use it. Lint gets stuck between the diamonds and looks horrible.
2.0,Very flimsy. Ended up returning.
2.0,The fabric looks dull and the dress is tight.
2.0,within less than 4 days of giving it as a gift it has broken
2.0,"I received the stone in the mail very beautiful, but smaller than it appeared in the picture."
2.0,Not good for busty women. I bought the green/teal color and it’s a much more muted color that I expected. I bought a size large and Will be returning.
2.0,"Too baggy, not fitted at all. Returned."
2.0,"Saw another review that indicated the pockets were sewn shut. Thought that must have been a mistake, but apparently it is a ""feature"". Sure enough, both side pockets and both back pockets totally sewn shut. WTF!  Also the drawstring ties on the outside, which is not indicated by the photo.  Carefully cut the pockets open with a razor blade and they survived the first washing. Time will tell. They fit OK. A little longer than I expected based on the photo."
2.0,Lighter in color than in the picture.
2.0,"Not at all as pictured unless the model is a child. The color is a beautiful red and I was really looking forward to receiving it, but highly disappointed when I opened the bag and took it out. The model shows it practically meeting your knee, but the sweater looks like a child's or perhaps a demo, but no where near what is pictured. I did not even bother to try it on just returned."
2.0,"It is to small for me to wear and it's a 3x . But like it,  Will put in a frame with Sugas pictures  and hang it up"
2.0,Ok but buttons are far apart
2.0,"Ordered a bunny, got a pig. Really....my daughter was pretty upset."
2.0,"If you want the baggy style size up twice, the material isn’t the best for the price, I’m glad that I used the system try before you buy, a big no for me."
2.0,"Based on a previous customer's review, ""the chest is snug for gals that are a little larger on top.""  With that, I ordered a large (usually have to wear size 8-10 tops).  Think I could have got away with a medium for ""the girls"". As for the length...definitely a small for my 5'4"" stature.  I'm a fan of loose, airy dresses for comfort.  Good there.  Poly so not breathable but hey, if there's a good breeze or you're walking, all good.  Material is on the thinner side with a light liner. This would be a perfect dress for someone taller (show off those legs!)  Debating on returning, altering 2-3 inches, or just donating."
2.0,Loved the material. They were a little big but she will grow into them.
2.0,The fabric is a little strange; it’s itchy and way more sparkly than the picture suggests. I wear a 12/14 in dresses the XL was way too tight; I’m 5’6 and the dress comes an inch  and a half over my knee. If you’re not comfortable with deep V-neck dresses and a lot of skin showing this isn’t the dress for you.
2.0,"This well made bra is difficult for me to put on. It runs small, so I really have to pull hard to make the front hook meet. Also, that easy close hook is quite a challenge to make work. Once closed, it is a bear to open. It's a nail breaker! I do like the racer back design, and the padding is well done. If the front hook wasn't such a problem, I'd order another in the next size up."
2.0,"One trip and they're falling apart. Need to return, not durable at all."
2.0,The tongue ring was so cute when I first got it but within three days the blue of the paw fell out now it is just a silver paw. Should not have fallen apart so quickly. Will not be buying again.
2.0,The new glasses are perfect fit w/ the glare blocking. Pleased that ear pieces are the perfect length and very flexible for a well-rounded face such as mine LOL.
2.0,cute and classy
2.0,Was so excited about giving this to my daughter for Christmas. Received it was a little bigger than expected but nice. Went to put it on and chain broke immediately. Very Cheap. Wouldn't order again.
2.0,"They were beautiful, perfect weight, just right purple color but way too small.  I was very disappointed in the fit, so I returned them.  I ordered 2 other pairs feim 2 other vendors and their size charts were spot on.  This vendor should revisit its size chart."
2.0,"Really poorly made, but what do you expect for the price?"
2.0,Not enough gel or cushioning for me
2.0,"I normally wear a Medium in almost everything. I ordered a Large in this because all the reviews said it runs small and I wanted it to fit the way it looks on the model. The large is HUGE! It's an oversized dress on me. It comes to my knees, the sleeves are about three inches past my fingers. I'm 5'5&#34; btw. It's a big sack. I don't need a nightgown and I don't plan on growing six inches and a hundred pounds anytime soon so I'm returning it. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it does seem to be a good quality sweater and it was really soft. Just huge."
2.0,"They are decent for the price, but there is already a run in the pair I tried on. I'm not sure how long these will last."
2.0,"They were very very tight, like tourniquet tight."
2.0,Not as good as I expected. The colors do not look as bright as in the images. Definitely not as good as others I have gotten.
2.0,Necklace looks like it s for a youngster not an adult.Didn t look like a quality piece.
2.0,"I love it but it changes color rather quickly,wish there was a way I could have preserved the color a little bit longer"
2.0,Don't waste your money on these masks. They are not cotton and are itchy.
2.0,"its like a jacket, It is not a dress"
2.0,"I thought I would like these after reading the other reviews but I was wrong. These run very large in comparison with other scrubs. I am 5'2&#34; and I usually wear a petite XS. These have very wide legs, they're baggy, and the waist is huge. I would not buy these again."
2.0,"Bought this for traveling. Haven't used it yet but not sure it works for me. It's kind of cheaply made--the zipper section for coins is hard to access, the cross body strap is twisted up, and it's hard to see how the card slots are RFID protected. On the positive side, it definitely will hold a large pair of sun glasses and an iPhone. Jury's still out on this one."
2.0,These run small. Order a size larger. Tight rings have left marks on finger for  a week now.
2.0,"They broke in a week, setting to week. Sorry The stone are beautiful"
2.0,"I love the look, the comfort is good, however, they have literally caused my feet to feel like there is no skin on the edges. It is misery.<br />It may not do anyone else<br />That way but it’s also causing the bones in my feet to ache terribly.  I don’t like doing bad reviews but I bought multiple pairs of them and they all<br />Do the same<br />Thing.  I have: brown, black, grey, white, royal blue."
2.0,Didn't fit as expected bit was able to use a part as needed. It did it's job for the price paid.
2.0,Looks great on but broke after a couple uses
2.0,Wore it twice. The fabric was tearing at the seam.<br />Mask seems high quality but should not be falling apart after two uses.
2.0,Button holes too small-very difficult to button/unbutton-also not sewn well-wouldn’t buy again
2.0,"The color is vibrant, must wear tank under it. Neck opening is too small for off the shoulder."
2.0,"It is nice, and it will work for what I need it for, but it does not look like the one shown. I was expecting a design like pictured on the cardigan, but it is just solid sequins."
2.0,Returned. Too large! Not enough time to order a smaller size for event.
2.0,Metal snaps broke after less than a year of use.  For the price I expected better.  Oh well.
2.0,Mine broke after just two days...
2.0,"It’s a cute top, just not for me. The color is more of a pinkish hue tone, vs a beige tan color I was expecting."
2.0,"Cheap, mesh like material"
2.0,"I ordered two sizes more, still small even whit a great shape trust me, designs its good but no the sizes."
2.0,"The bottom 20% of the lens is the reading magnification I use.  So far so good.  I could not use the transition part of the lens--the part where you are supposed to read the computer screen.  If I moved my head up or down even a quarter of an inch, everything went out of focus.  Never again."
2.0,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. It came way sooner the expected and looked exactly like the picture. It fit his head perfectly. I gave it only 2 stars because even though it looked exactly like it should have, when we pulled it out of the bag it came in for him to try it on, it had the most disgusting moldy, mildew smell. I washed it in the washer and dried it hoping that would take care on it, but it still smells awful. It's like it was put in the packaging wet and stored for months and then shipped out.  Hopefully mine was just a fluke, but it will definately not be worn. Yuck!"
2.0,"The dress is so thin, it doesn’t matter what underwear I wear, you can see it. The only choice would be to wear none."
2.0,Very tight around the arms. Looked like a cheep knockoff Of the picture
2.0,"I ordered rose red.  The color should be called pink even though it is a little darker than the bubble gum pink color, but still unquestionably pink.  It is not like the photo on the website at all.  I didn't want pink - would have preferred blue if I had known the actual color.  Unfortunately I wore them for the first time today and didn't have an option to not wear them since I needed gloves for my ride."
2.0,"Outfit is very adorable, I’m looking forward to giving to my niece for Christmas.  HOWEVER, you can barely see the “wishes” part of the phrase on the shirt.  Disappointed in that.  It looks like they printed over it.  But looking at the other reviews that part is visible so maybe it’s the one I received.... also the material is very thin."
2.0,"This is a comfortable and the quality is very reasonable for the price. Sadly, they quickly acquired a foot odor, so I'll have to order something else."
2.0,Chest is super tight
2.0,Makes everything look blue. Mirrored front is very difficult to remove fingerprints from. Can’t really tell that they are polarized. Nice case.
2.0,"these t shirts are not a breathable fabric, made me sweaty almost as soon as i put them on"
2.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 150 lbs, a 34DD. I bought this suit in a Large, when it came, the bottom part fit very well, but the cups were half the size of my breasts. For a large swimsuit, the cups were very small. I loved everything else about this swimsuit and if you're big on bottom and tiny on top, this would be perfect for you. If you're like me, big on bottom and top, keep looking for another suit."
2.0,I wanted something really baggy and longer in length...so I ordered 2 sizes larger. I tried it on immediately upon receiving it and it is very small/tight fitting and very short. The arms are also way too small and tight.
2.0,Way too baggy and too short. I wouldn’t buy this again I got a small but it just wasn’t flattering like the picture
2.0,Extremely disappointed with Nike quality this time. These pants are not worth the price charged.  They’re baggy and not in a good way and they look and fit like dollar store joggers.
2.0,Exactly what I paid for. Cheap and pretty. Let's you know the time.
2.0,I sized up and it was still to small. It’s super cute. Just make sure to go up a few sizes.
2.0,"This item runs smaller then the chart will have you believe, and sizing up maybe a problem as I see most of what would be 'normal sizes' are sold out. Keep this in mind. The material is nice and thick (got the yellow color) but the size was terrible, and sadly now I am without a dress as the size I would need is out of stock :("
2.0,The style of this skirt gets ruined in the way its folded. I have the black one with the white stripes and love that one so i bought the pink too. The pink came in and its like straight on some parts and pleated in the others so its not very cute. Also the wrinkles of where it was folded never come out. Color and fabric are really cute though.
2.0,"Two stars because they are cute, but they're very cheaply made and most are bent and look crooked when I wear them =/"
2.0,All Items do not match as described. I needed the set to be matching. Due to the delivery being a week late I am now having to find a replacement item in store.
2.0,"The colors are bright and my son loved that! Only to be disappointed that the material is like spandex! It's tight even in a higher age group!<br />Seriously, when did kids clothes 🙄 go by age! Disappointed, especially when we planned to use it for school pictures!"
2.0,Very cheaply made even for 20$. Bear is cute. Coloring book is about the size of my hand. Not worth the purchase
2.0,These buckles are too big to get through Jean hoops. It takes a long time to get them through the belt loops that my 5 year old will not sit still.
2.0,I bought two different ones and they were both defective
2.0,"The material is very soft, but does not fit like the picture. Just kind of a baggy tank top."
2.0,Flimsy and off-color
2.0,Very pretty product! Great quality but doesn’t fit well. I feel like I have. Normal size arm and I can not wear it. To tight around my wrist!
2.0,Material is not all that great and the size runs small
2.0,Cute key chain but character fell off of key chain after a week.
2.0,Cute pants. Super small
2.0,"2xl fits like a large. i have large breasts so i have to go up sizes to have everything fit properly. if you’re a US large with not too much boob going on, it’s perfect. material is just polyester, the only good thing going on for it is the skirt. it’s cheap material, but there’s slight elastic in the band. everything else is just wack. it comes with everything, jacket, white button up, tag, skirt, pantyhose.. but awful quality. don’t get if you’re on the bigger size, 2xl does nothing for you."
2.0,I was expecting this to be more of a stretchy cotton material but it's that shiny slippery material so I didn't really care for it. It also was tighter than I was expecting so I ultimately will probably just donate it. Wasn't a good fit for me.
2.0,"These leggings are so soft, which is great, BUT they are in NO WAY a tummy control product. There is no extra support, or thicker elastic in the tummy area. They are high waisted, but the waist is the same as the leg part. ALSO, they say they are selling a 6 pack of three colors (black, navy blue, grey) so I assumed I’d get two of each or some combination equaling 6. THEY ONLY SENT ME THREE, WHEN THE DESCRIPTION CLEARLY STATES “SIX PACK.”<br />BUYER BEWARE:  go with the picture of the leggings, seller will not honor the description (or even address that they’re wrong)."
2.0,"Shorts, too short"
2.0,So I just receive this today and they necklace is completely tangled it was that way in the package I have tried to untangle it for the last 30 mins I am so upset . I'm afraid it's gonna break  if I  keep trying to untangle it . Im adding a photo. The photo is of what the necklace look like after 30 mins of trying to get it untangled and it's still tangled
2.0,"Now I was really excited for this product because I was going to give it to my little sister as a gift because she loves the Legend of Zelda as do I, but the picture is very deceiving. From the picture it looked as if it was a crystal with another crystal or plastic heart inside of it but it's nothing like that. More like just one solid piece so, it's just not what I was hoping for. Luckily my sister still loved it. I was just expecting something a little bit better quality that's all."
2.0,Disappointing. Amazon photo showed NO registered trademark logo (circled R) - product arrived WITH one. There are legions of Amazon reviewers/buyers that have voiced displeasure with these logos. Item is well made otherwise.<br /><br />The term &#34;remove before flight&#34; is a common international aviation phrase that is not appropriate for a registered trademark. The products appearance and value are diminished by the trademark symbol. Recommend associated vendors and manufactures remove it.<br /><br />For those vendors who offer products are NOT marked they should note this predominately in their Amazon posting so buyers can note this and select their product over  others that DO have the trademark symbol. Also vendors who ship products with the trademark symbol need to update their products to reflect that in their posted photos. Buyers rely on accurate photos to buy their items online.
2.0,"They don't fit to my face at all, and are about a breathable as a leather muzzle. They are extremely uncomfortable. I will admit though, the cork does feel pretty nice, and seem decently made. The ones I received are just way too small for my face."
2.0,"glasses gave me headache,  if you want to return you have to pay your own postage"
2.0,Bottom fit like granny panties
2.0,"I thought this sweater would be of decent quality but was wrong. The material is thin. I bought a large, I am 5'11 180 lbs and it barely fit. I'm more disappointed with the quality than the fit but fear the sweater is going to shrink after washing and won't fit at all. Don't waste your money."
2.0,"The lack of stretch was a shock.  They did not fit.  I'd held them up against my other bike shorts (I like to wear them under my flirty skirts) and saw they were the same, but when I pulled them out today to wear, they did NOT stretch and give like most.  Go up a larger size than you think. (I am not Jay; I'm his mother).<br /><br />There is no &#34;return item&#34; option in My Orders."
2.0,"Sizing was way off, and it is very cheap looking."
2.0,It fine but not a very high-quality
2.0,"I am petite and often wear XS skirts and I couldn't even get this ""Small"" over my shoulders or hips.  The waist band was  so tight, I didn't even try the impossible, the ""Small"" made for petite girls.  The fabric is like something from the 80s.  I'll donate it to Goodwill or one of my other charity stores, with the tag still on, for the Children's department."
2.0,Beautiful bracelet that I just received for valentine day. This is day two and the clasp has opened on its on three times. I am the bracelet will  be lost due to faulty clasp.  Be very careful with the clasp for its not staying closed.
2.0,They are somewhat comfortable. I'm a size 34B and they are really tight under the arms and the bottom band. I'm not fat and I'm not skinny. You would need to be in shape or be lean to fit into them properly.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 2 because it says they fit my size. It does but it's snug.
2.0,I ordered the 4 pack and I only received two.
2.0,One size fit all is a joke
2.0,Buy a size larger than you need.  They shrink up a lot!!!
2.0,"Fit was way too large, but at least he can grow into them so not a total waste.  Had to order different underwear right away so a little annoyed."
2.0,"The color is more of a puke yellow instead of the tan I was expecting. Comfortable but, runs on the big side."
2.0,It looks like the picture but it also looks like a dance costume. 😂 Not for me. The collar is weird as well.
2.0,"I had This exact item in another life, had more pockets.  Had more structure and felt just as light.  I kept this new one,  because well, there is no other on amazon.  I’m so sorry I got rid of that old dirty blue one I had before.  Merchandise seems to be getting cheaper and cheaper....and cheaper.  For the same money.  Sad.  Wow, do I regret getting rid of the old one.  It was wonderful."
2.0,The shirt fit great but noticed there’s a hole on the back of the shirt... wearing this to a Halloween party but I’m now going to have to be extra careful so the hole does not get any bigger..
2.0,Though I ordered size eleven as recommended and a size larger then shoe size I wear they were too small
2.0,Looks longer in photo. Just comes to my waist
2.0,I have a slide belt top grain leather belt it's a solid piece of leather this belt by West does not look like a solid piece of leather  there is three layers You can see them when you cut the belt to fit  I would not buy it again  I will go back to my slide belt
2.0,"Love the shoes, however after being worn 5 times, the wiring inside the shoe just pulled out when grand daughter took off her shoes.  Didn't find out until months after purchase.  I don't recommend these unless they fix the wire problem.  Very cute, but the tech side is horrible."
2.0,"Despite reading multiple reviews and sizing up, the shirt still did not fit.  It also does not look like the shirt in the photos.  The shirt in the photos looks like it is black and white and not see-through.  The shirt I received is black and off white and see through, with multiple threads hanging off almost every seam. It is also more boxy/ shorter than anticipated. I am not able to wear this shirt, but after I requested a return, the return process presented to me seemed to be overly complicated and expensive.  I ended up receiving a 20% refund."
2.0,Space is actually smaller than I thought.
2.0,"I bought these because my sage green band broke. I was excited to try them, the pictures looked good. The quality of them were not great, plus the green one had white stitching, making it look cheaper- the others had stitching close to the band color. They were not comfortable, even after adjusting it- just too tight. I ended up returning- the white thread on the green band really bugged me. Also the part that slides into the Apple Watch looked like it could easily break."
2.0,"They shrank quite a bit after the first wash, and the hem in the shorts started unraveling.  The color faded as well, and the shirt got a hole in it after wearing it twice.  Not happy."
2.0,"The dress itself is made from cheap material, but I was not suprised given the price.  What I couldn't believe was how see through the white version was.  It fit nicely and I would've kept it if it hadn't been so sheer."
2.0,Fit to loose
2.0,"Love the design (very sharp) and the quality is also good. Unfortunately, the part that connects is ridiculous. Won't stay connected and it constantly falls off your wrist. Too bad for an otherwise nice product."
2.0,it's so ugly in person.
2.0,Very low quality....the broke the first day of use...returning them...
2.0,ALERT ALERT ALERT - CHAIN BROKE AFTER WEARING ONLY TWICE
2.0,"Very thin material, the word ‘compression’ should be removed from this item. No way could this be used without a sports bra to workout or even walk."
2.0,The “anklet” looks nice however we don’t know how it fits. As you can see the clasp and the chain that would give the length needed to wear it are on the same side. Making it useless. It is too big to be a bracelet. Very disappointed. Waited quite a while for it. We gave to 2 stars because it is a nice looking anklet.
2.0,Thin.material - with tails advertised as untucked misleading<br />It is also big and baggy and my husband is  not small
2.0,Very awkward length. The neck came up too high for comfort. Not made well.
2.0,Gorgeous pattern. Seams of the dress do not seem they would hold up to wear more than a couple times though. Length was perfect for me and I am 5’7”
2.0,Couldn't breath
2.0,ehh..ok
2.0,"Very cheap looking, but doesn't cost much."
2.0,"If you want this product, choose 3 or 4 sizes bigger than what you'd normally wear. I'm not exaggerating. This is a super cute vest but runs very, very small."
2.0,"Cheap and flimsy fabric, as expected for the price, but it wasn't even put together correctly. Unwearable."
2.0,"I hate these! Way too long so the heel is up above my ankle lol, too thick."
2.0,"Very thin fabric and poorly sewn, loose threads everywhere and would not hold up with anything heavy. The lining inside is weird. Not worth even this low price."
2.0,Uncomfortable and itchy as well as scratchy . Does not fit me well. Also It has no give in it. Also does not look like the picture in person. Somewhat uncomfortable.
2.0,"The hole was very small and at the seam, but I didnt notice it til I was already wearing it"
2.0,"I bought my usual size it fits, except that it is WAY too small at the hips. I was excited to get this, now disappointed."
2.0,"I purchased the ""Black tie dye"" in XL and the ""D-brown Leopard Print"" in L and ended up returning both. I'm surprised that these are under the same product listing as they feel like two completely different products.<br /><br />The ""Black tie dye"" is not black - it has a little bit of black in it, but because it's tie dye, be aware that it appears more predominantly blue/gray. It's a soft, light fabric with a little bit of stretch to it. Because of the fabric, it feels like it runs large. If I weren't gun-shy because of how bad the other color was, I might have tried another size in this color.<br /><br />The ""D-brown Leopard Print"" is a thick, stiff fabric; it almost looks like the pattern has been sprayed on because in places where there's lint, as you brush the lint off, the area underneath has no color. The fabric feels so rough and papery, but neither color has a tag showing what the material is. That said, this color was a bit more true to size if you don't mind the feel of the fabric and the little spots."
2.0,"This hat is not a low profile hat. The quality is horrible. One side is longer than the other. I can pull it down past halfway over my left ear. The other side hits at the top of my right ear. There is a good half inch of air in between the top of my head and the crown of the hat, if I don’t pull it down over my ears. What d-bag wears a hat over their ears? Very disappointed."
2.0,"Really disappointed at the fit. I went by the size chart measurements and ordered an XL...I could have definitely gone with a L had I'd known it ran so big. I'm pretty disappointed because I'm going to North Africa and thought this would be really pretty to wear, sadly it's too shapeless and I don't have time to send it back to exchange. Shame. It looks alright, a lil brighter than I expected and made of a really club outfit kindve rayon that isn't my taste but, I guess I got what I paid for."
2.0,"I have so many pairs of black pants and wanted a pair of grey pants.  I thought these looked cute and the price was good.  When I received the pants, they were black!  What the heck?  They look like nice, good quality pants, but I had to return them because I don't need any more black."
2.0,Very cheaply made. The front is flat as a pancake and looks very odd.
2.0,You are limited to an American waist size of 35 inches. It is a miserable fit for other waist sizes and there is no set of instructions when you receive product.
2.0,"I ordered three of these, two in a Medium and one in an XL for a group cosplay. They came in on time, but all of them were a different shade of light khaki. The XL was more yellow and the Mediums were, well, khaki, but one was slightly darker than the other.. I have to make it work, but I am quite disappointed in them. The arms were also very tight on the XL, even though I properly measured. Overall, I am very upset."
2.0,They feel like they are made of plastic
2.0,Super cheap quality and look. Obvious with price it’s a fake but by look too.
2.0,"I’m 5’3, 166, 38D. I bought XL and it fit snug. I am short so the length was perfect. My biggest complaint would be after you wash it. The fabric has super wrinkles! I also bought this in purple...I tried to iron it and almost burned it. So be sure to use a low setting it anything at all. Unfortunately I’ll probably only wear these dress once, maybe twice. They are pretty and comfy but the quality is ‘mediocre ‘ at best"
2.0,Unfortunately I had to return these. The optics are great but the frame is extremely large. They remind me of the glasses you would wear after cataracts surgery.
2.0,The elastic part was too tight on my son. We purchased 2 different sizes to compare and the bigger size was too long for his feet. Maybe my son has wide heels or something but after just a few minutes of putting them on there were little red marks/indents around his ankle and heel area. We are also trying to find a pair of shoes he is comfortable wearing as he hates wearing shoes and these did not work for us. Otherwise the leather material and soles were nice and customer service was very accommodating and easy to work with.
2.0,Had these for 3 months and seldom wore since I have 2 other pairs and now they’re falling apart.
2.0,"My feet sweat a bit, these do a horrible job of collecting sweat and making it wet and unusable after time. If you tend to sweat from your feet a lot avoid this product"
2.0,"Does not look like the the picture. The print of the flowers is much larger then pictured, the cut of the item is also different. The picture shows a lose flowy material, the this item is nothing like that. Also it is very long. I am 4""11 and ordered a small, it is to long to be a top and to tight to be flowy. It fits more like a skater dress than rather than a long top. The way the print of the flowers is placed and seen makes you look very wide. It's cute as a dress I guess, but not what I wanted or expected."
2.0,"Has a great grip, however mine got torn up pretty fast. This would be a great glove if it wasnt for it’s lack of durability."
2.0,It really  doesn't stan up as well as the one pictured.  The small piece that suports it isn't strong or large enough. I'll just use it as a case.
2.0,they are a bit too big for me.  oversized really means oversized.
2.0,"Everything was wrong with this! Even the second time around, total waste of money."
2.0,I liked this a lot but one of the metals is popping right out of the back. And I just got it 5 days ago
2.0,"It was okay, runs big. Quality of material-fair"
2.0,"The earring is beautiful but I wish it came in 20g. And because it was from amazon, my piercer wouldn't taper my piercing to place this earring in."
2.0,Too small. Would suggest 2 sizes up
2.0,"When I take the watch off at bedtime by morning it quits running,guess you have to wear it to bed to keep it wond,I through it away."
2.0,Very thin material.  Not particularly warming.
2.0,"Men’s tshirt. Super long tubular sleeves, long and skinny shirt, can’t tuck it in or leave it out, super awkward"
2.0,Microscopic!!
2.0,"They are nice but too small I wish it had a measurement,"
2.0,Size is smaller than expected
2.0,I am not a fan of these 100% polyester drawstring pants that turned into floods after drying dryer. They were HUGE so I thought they would shrink a little on the dryer but they ended up just getting super short but that’s okay because I’m turning them into shorts.
2.0,Not happy with the quality of this bag.
2.0,"Runs VERY SMALL. I normally wear a medium, but I ordered a large and it fits like a small. I gave them to my 12 year old daughter."
2.0,"When I unboxed the bag, I was bewildered upon finding only one side is suede. The other side is an imitation-looking leather. The construction was shoddy as the zipper was sewn in only half way with most of the zipper hanging out the end of the purse. I will be returning. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Esta muy bonito, pero mala calidad, se rompió a la primera puesta de la costura del pañal y de los tirantes"
2.0,The quality of fabric was disappointing and the color was way off (Orange in the yellow).
2.0,"My Mom has 3 small pendants very special to her. I thought I'd get a necklace charm holder so she could wear them together. I wasn't expecting Tiffany's quality of course, but I wouldn't trust this skimpy thing to hold even one of her pendants, and they're only about 3/4 "" each. If it wasn't such a pain in the ass to return, I would. Oh Well."
2.0,"Very poor quality , rt. =exactly the same as lt. No structure 2 any part of slippers."
2.0,"I had a hard time finding the right size in these to begin with. Reviews say they run huge so I got an entire size down which fit but pressed on my toes. Then I got a half size up and the fit was perfect and this jelly is comfy. Love that it's clear with no glitter (many jellies out there are glittery). However, about a month into owning these shoes and maybe wearing them about 10 to 12 times the buckle broke. Whatever attaches the square part of the buckle that the strap goes through actually separated from the shoe and I had to tape it on the fly while out wearing the shoe. I'm actually a jelly connoisseur--I have a few pairs and I've read reviews carefully before buying on Amazon and I know with these shoes the buckle breaking is not an uncommon problem. Because of this, I have always just slipped them on without undoing the buckle. But the buckle broke without me even operating it like a functioning buckle. Just crumbled suddenly one day. Oh well. Sad because I really liked these. I bought a different pair last year that I still wear that are slightly different and I have worn those constantly all year long (live in Texas so always jelly weather) without them breaking."
2.0,I washed on gentle cycle in cold water but some of the buttons fell off in the first washing.
2.0,Too cheap looking I gave them away
2.0,Color not match
2.0,"to me, this was weird fabric - didn't care for the texture-izing.  It was not mentioned (I think) in the description.  sent it back."
2.0,"Not as described, very cheapily made."
2.0,I was skeptical just because I think it's weird to buy clothes from amazon.  But it didn't look good on me at all.  And it was more clingy than I would have wanted.  I'm returning. And it seemed like more of a maternity shirt as well.  Oh well.
2.0,"Adorable hat, but very small size… barely fit most adults"
2.0,"They feel fairly flimsy, and my feet easily slide off my feet even though my heel is right at the back of the slipper. &#34;Meh&#34;"
2.0,I was hopeful this design could work but it is so challenging to get on and off that I don't use it.<br />This picture must be staged from someone stretching it into position and not moving because one you move it shifts the underarm back part bunches.<br />Kathy R. - Okla
2.0,"This purse started out great. Tons of functionality. Pocket for my phone, for my cards, for my money. Then it stopped zipping up and despite my attempts to get it to zip correctly again. I could see this issue cropping up of I'd owned the pursed for years, but it's only been a few months. So I went back to my old purse. Such a shame."
2.0,"Left neck line is cut bigger than right side and stomach/hip area is tight.  Ordered XL per my measurements and it fit everywhere except too tight in the stomach/hip area. Tried to reorder, but was told it was unavailable for reorder so I had to get a refund.  Shirt feels nice and I would actually wear it if it fit correctly."
2.0,Ordered in gold but got silver. Was disappointed but didn't wanna go through the hassle of returning it. They're ok bracelets
2.0,"This would be an amazing pair of jeans, but they have an odd smell I can't get rid of even though I've washed them several times. I even soaked them in baking soda which gets urine smell out (I have seven kids and potty training can be nuts). They are super cute and fit me great! I'm 5'2, 130lbs and like my flared jeans long on me so I can wear wedges."
2.0,"Didn't fit my ear, and the tail end with the earring broke off when i tried to adjust it. No."
2.0,returning it but  it's  a nice dress
2.0,"The style was nice, the fit was nice, but the brown flaked off very easy. She scuffed it on the first time wearing them. She has another brand that has held up much better to scuffs. I wouldn't buy them again."
2.0,"The hat is well made has good embroidery and a nice shape, but when you put it on you realize that it is really, really, really tall.  This sucker is taller than any ball cap I've ever seen.  In fact I dug through my grandpa's old hats to compare it.  None of his old tire store or feed lot hats (you know, the ones with the foam fronts and mesh backs) were even close.  This hat from brim to top button was a full 1/2 inch taller than the closest old boy hat I could find.  When you pull it down to where it pushes your ears out, the top of your hair still doesn't touch the top of the hat.  There is no way to adjust this dimension.  You're just left with a 10 gallon ball cap...and an irresistible urge to ask evwybody to be vewry vewry quiet while you're hunting wabbits."
2.0,Giving these 2 stars is being pretty nice.  They are just not quality made.  Lights started going out around the shoe on day 2. lf you have an active little boy you will not get your moneys worth.  New shoes neededweeks 3-4 weeks of wearing them to school only.
2.0,"I am a large in most sizes and I need and XL with this company.  Also, the color of the shirt and the design is almost $20, that's really disappointing.  I can get a graphic t at old navy without bad screen printing for $8 so I'm pretty disappointed all around.  I do not recommend."
2.0,The wire keeps on coming out of it if it's a little tight but other than that it's okay
2.0,My button popped off in less than a month
2.0,I ordered a large because I have large hips however I am small busted. This dress fit terribly at the top!  It ‘s cut strangely so that most of my breast isn’t covered. I have to wear a tank top underneath which defeats the purpose of the dress
2.0,No me agrado que se rompen fácil
2.0,"Just received this dress and the fabric is beautiful, but my problem is the boob area. I am a large top. 38C. I ordered an XXL  in this dress hoping it to fit and maybe even be little loose. I can't even get this dress to cover half my bust area! Everything else fits great, but if you have some/any weight on top... I would probably look for something else."
2.0,"I’ve bought this brand multiple times in the past. These shirts however are different sizes, although all larges. They will shrink dramatically. They are also very cheap and already falling apart after two washes without being dried."
2.0,"how to change time? Cause every time I use the right side turning pin, it changes the date!"
2.0,According to the size chart provided these should have fit me well. But when I put them on they were too tight for comfort.
2.0,It’s a bit tight I’d order a size up in the fabric is so itchy I did not like this skirt At all
2.0,"Ordered a medium and is way too big, armpits hang down too low. Wide and short."
2.0,even tho I ordered it xlg this item was a little too small and normally that size is Not that tight.. a little disappointing
2.0,No thank you
2.0,"Beautiful but came in missing jewels, which just made it look cheap."
2.0,"i know my son has skinny legs, but these fit his waist alright. a little bigger than his other 4t underwear, but his legs are soo loose they constantly give him a wedgie. i would think twice before getting these, unless your child has chubby legs."
2.0,"The metal piece is really thick, if you want to wear it, you'll have to bend to shape it. I bought about a dozen belts and one of them came already molded which is much easier."
2.0,"the tank top was too open at the neck and large, the order was to arrive on Saturday and it didn't arrive until Monday!!"
2.0,Very cute and cozy but these slippers do not fit on feet when child runs around.  They slip down and bunch up under heel  and generate excess space/fabric over toes so child trips.
2.0,"I am not a fan, the material is Lenin like and there were are tons of wrinkles and I can see the fabric wrinkling in the future. It has quite a bit of stiffness to it and the sleeves were past my wrist. The smocking at the wrist was also an interesting choice."
2.0,It fits good just if you wear it all day it rolls up the shorts does. You can feel the metal it the top part and it starts to poke you. Other than that it's ok if you don't mind pulling and tugging
2.0,"The title ""Men's Bulletproof Style Leather Vest"" is misleading. Even if the bulletproof pads were not included with the order, I would expect to be able to add the Kevlar at a later date. I would NOT use the word ""bulletproof"" in the ad at all since it's not bulletproof and you can't make it bulletproof either. When using a cell phone to order (a small screen) it is difficult to see all the info about the vest and not until you reach the bottom of the ad does it say ""not bulletproof""."
2.0,"Love the earring, after putting them together. They actually came in ""pieces "" and had to put them together"
2.0,These fell down and wouldn't stay up. :(
2.0,"While the idea of this duffel backpack is great, the product is very cheaply made. I purchased these for my kids to carry their sparing gear and gui, which while bulky, are not heavy.  I am having to replace either the bags or the zippers on the bags because after not even 2 months of use, they are broken. Apply the money to a higher quality bag!"
2.0,"I bought a size smaller than what I thought I needed, and they're still baggy on me. Further warning: They're polyester, so unless you need them for cold Northern winters, these are not going to be ideal."
2.0,Looks great but was way too big
2.0,"They are not as cool as I anticipated, people can see your eyes through the sunglasses"
2.0,"Noce shirt but definitely runs small compared to american sizing. Ordered a 2xl and it fits snug on my daughter who wears a size 10 or large in most womens clothing. She is 5'-4"" and 138 pounds."
2.0,Loved the hats but only one had lights that worked. We were at a santa rampage and the broken lights were disappointing.
2.0,Sandler’s did help with foot pain However the bottom of them came apart within a few weeks off Amazon gave me a refund but would not recommend this product
2.0,"As much flare that shows in this picture, it was very snug! Order a size up."
2.0,"Great design. The shirt runs really small, and short length wise. I'm guessing I would have had to get 2 sizes bigger for it to fit properly."
2.0,Not real crazy with how this is put together. The picture made it seem like it was like a sun dress. But the back is totally open and has straps to tie. Not really a fan of that.
2.0,"Does not fit like photo, shows much much cleavage. Looks bad if pinned or taped."
2.0,It's very cute but it's small in the chest area .
2.0,"When adjusted at it's largest size, the width of this bracelet is about 2&#34; diameter (4” circumference) so this was much smaller than I expected. It says it should be adjustable up to 7.9” circumference, but that’s not the item I received. I'm pretty sad about it - it is a beautiful bracelet that seems to be good quality. Although I do have small wrists, it wouldn't even make it past my knuckles. Will be returning."
2.0,This shirt is super big it is over sized . It gives off a baggy look
2.0,I had high expectations due to the great reviews. Touchscreen doesn't work. Gloves look a little weird in person. Doesn't keep your hands warm either. Oh well...
2.0,"They are very pretty, but sizes don't go up high enough on Amazon.  Need an eight.  The 5x fit my friend perfectly.  I will have to do to a different web site to find mine."
2.0,Looked exactly like the picture but it broke within a week. Overall it isn't worth it if it is going to break that quickly turn my sisters ear green.
2.0,"It’s ok, overpriced and it shrunk quite a bit after the first wash. Would not buy again."
2.0,"I like the size of this clutch and all of the features; in fact, it has everything that I am looking for except that it feels very cheap to me and I seriously doubt that it is leather despite being advertised as leather. For less than $30, I didn't expect beautiful high-end leather, but I've had it for a couple of weeks now (only because I haven't had time to return it yet) and it still has a very strong odor of chemicals. It is also very thin and rigid and certainly not like any type of natural material that I have ever seen. The inside and all the little fittings seem equally cheap. Sorry! Based on other reviews, I really expected to like it, but I will definitely be returning it."
2.0,Don’t last bit a few times of wear
2.0,"It was just too big, I needed a smaller size and I wasn't crazy about the cut once I saw it on. I bet it looks better when it actually fits lol."
2.0,Busted when i got it. Put water in and it poured out the bottom. Quality looks better than it is. Or maybe i just got the one.
2.0,Ordered a size I usually wear and could hardly get them on - had to return.
2.0,"Picture shows seam going all the way down the mask, the mask received was just by the nose, making the mask look pointy. Returned it with no problem"
2.0,"I love this top and how it looks but the straps are VERY loose and don't line up with my bra. I have a bigger chest and can't wear strapless or go braless. If I can figure out a way to line up the straps with my bra straps, then it's a great top"
2.0,"Beautiful dress, but size runs small. I am returning both dresses and re ordering one size bigger."
2.0,"Description fooled me, I thought large would fit I am a small person 5'7&#34; and the large was too small to fit my arm I will give it away to someone?"
2.0,Just didn't like the quality and the look of only having one sleeve.  I returned it.
2.0,These fell short of what I'd hoped for in many ways.  They look much cheaper in person than in the photos; the color is lighter and less rich than pictured.  The boot fit loosely on the top/sides and there is zero support from the insole; they just felt like cheap boots.  This is a prime example of you get what you pay for.  Cheap.
2.0,"Cardigan is too oversized, expected to be more body fitting like a blazer. I ordered a size large but the bottom part seems to wide."
2.0,Beautiful necklace but it shipped broken so I have no choice but to return it.
2.0,"I underestimated the size. I wear from a small depending on the way it's made to a medium. Got a medium and it was a huge mistake! It was too big! Looked more like an XL. Gave it to my mom who wears an XL, still bulging in the front of her, plus it was very long! If you buy, make very sure if this is what you want because even the sizing chart measurements weren't accurate and I used the measurement chart guide!"
2.0,It’s pretty much like a toy set. The main umbrella was too little even for my ten year old daughter.
2.0,Below par.  Skimpy.  Almost see-through.  Too tight.
2.0,left black spots on rug from soft rubber sole. Finally had to junk them.
2.0,"I love the shirt, but it was way smaller than I expected and kinda tight. It doesn't flatter me"
2.0,this is a great set if you just want to have it one display. the headband it very stiff and the ribbon around the blade handles comes off very easy. the stickers are great quality though
2.0,Do not buy this ring unless you don't mind wearing a pinky ring. Item is a lot smaller than portrait in the picture
2.0,I thought that Kevlar was hard to cut with a knife but these cut on the back quite easily.  The Nitrile coating is good so I will get some use out of them but I was surprised that they cut so easily.
2.0,After first use one of them got hole! I wouldnt buy them again..
2.0,"I bought a large hoping they would be baggy and I could wear them until I transition to maternity clothes.  They were very small!  I’m 5’9-5’10, 142lbs and they were very short.  Light weight fabric. The black with butterflies was very cute but unfortunately I’ll be returning them due to how small they are.  Also thought they were junior pants based on the size."
2.0,I gave them away. A mens size 13 should be A size 13 even if it's wide or norrow. I buy size 13 for length.  I'm A size 12 1/2 . Your sizes Or real Small for Men.
2.0,"I purchased the 3-6 month size for my daughter who typically wears 3-6 month size clothing.  However, the straps are way too long and do not have a means of adjusting them.  I notice other infant swimsuits that do have adjustable straps -- I will be purchasing one of them to use instead."
2.0,"There's  no fit to this thing and no  style either.  It's almost like tossing  an  over-sized blanket on and hoping you don't look ridiculous (which I'm sure I do)  I'm giving it 2 stars because it's soft and  warm but other than that, I'm just not feeling it has much going for it."
2.0,Fit tight on breast area 38D
2.0,Xl fits like a medium
2.0,"They are very tiny! The arms were too uncomfortable and were squishing my head... and I have a pretty small head! Sad, they are real cute."
2.0,"It was my fault for not realizing that this was a plated item. This silver wore off in a couple of weeks. The &#34;eyes&#34; of the evil eye are NOT symmetrical... as in some of the &#34;eyes&#34; look like they're giving someone the side eye. Great for a disposable gift for the beach or something, but not worth the price. I thought it was cute, but not a lasting item."
2.0,kept falling out or sticking up off of nose. not bent correctly. Also inside bend could be seen from nose..
2.0,Cheap fabric and wrinkles in the dryer.
2.0,"These are cute. Seemed to be good quality. However, the Velcro has stopped working and they fall off my sons feet as he walks. Super disappointed. Bought these before and they at least lasted until he outgrow them."
2.0,"These pants are ok. I read the reviews and sizing chart so they fit pretty good. The color was more of a light blue and a solid color. Not quite what’s pictured, so that was a lil disappointing. I’m returning them because of the color."
2.0,I read reviews on this before I purchased it and most of the people said to buy a size up so I got a Large but it still ran kind of small. The neck line is very awkward and the arms run short. It served its purpose because I needed something fast but I would not recommend it.
2.0,"I’m not one to write complainy, negative reviews but feel like I could help someone keep from making my mistake ... first the positives:  the sweater fit right and is warm. However ...<br /><br />- it smelled horribly until I washed it<br />- very stiff, rough material until I washed it<br />- took forrrrrevvvverrrrr to get here (my mistake for not checking where it was coming from)<br /><br />But the biggest disappointment: THE COLOR ISN’T EVEN CLOSE to what is shown or described.<br /><br />I’d encourage you to give this product a pass if you’re looking for it to be the exact color of what’s shown."
2.0,"Overall it seems like an OK bag. The straps don't detach as it shows in the picture, there is not handle on the side of the bag and not power adapter case as pictured. Never a good sign when buying a product and it doesn't match the pictures. Be cautious about your purchase."
2.0,"i didn’t really like it, i wouldn’t recommend it. just buy a strapless bra or something"
2.0,Waffle style gets dirty really easy and the arm length is a little short even on the xxl
2.0,This leo arrived with multiple threads sticking out
2.0,"I really liked the way it looked on my wrist.  Very stylish.  However, the band broke at the end, right where it attached to the watch on the second time I wore it.  Returned it."
2.0,The elephant charm came off as soon as I put it on. And the material is cheap.
2.0,beautiful but does this even fit a normal human being?
2.0,The draping of the material was ackward along the back. This dress was not the color in the picture nor as full
2.0,Holes along stitching.
2.0,"My hands are small, I always wear small gloves, but when these came, one fit perfectly, and the other is narrower in the finger width. Annoying, but not worth bothering to return. Bummer. :\"
2.0,"I wear it all the time. You can't really see the picture, but I wear it knowing what it is. Otherwise it's pretty sturdy."
2.0,"Velcro on these bibs don’t hold well, other than that they serve the purpose"
2.0,Difficult to put on shoe. Probably won't make the effort to put them on another pair of shoes
2.0,I haven’t had it long and the top part already broke off so not I can’t even wear it!
2.0,These are pretty but a bit uncomfortable. They fit very tight and pinch the skin a bit
2.0,"Love the look, but it runs a size to two sizes small."
2.0,I had purchased a couple tops with front zippers.  This had only the V opening.
2.0,This bag has a low built quality. The shoulder strap padding detached from the top after a few uses.
2.0,"I order a dress, and receive a blouse!!! The quality is good, but i want a dress!!!"
2.0,Inside material is very scratchy
2.0,"Nice fabric, but the 3x was way to small."
2.0,"Well,  i loved this dress.....UNTIL, i was hand washing it after only wearing it one time (to church, for maybe 2 hrs) and upon washing it noticed the left shoulder seam was coming apart. It almost looks as though it ripped but i have no idea how that could have happened...the fabric is really thin so that would be my only guess as to what in the world happened....needless to say i got lots of compliments on it, the one time i got to wear it. 😔"
2.0,"No support, wires are bent and twisted in top, you can't tie it right to keep the girls in, they just fall out the bottom,  I ordered up a few sizes, was wayyy to big. Poor quality, but that's what I get for ordering a cheap suit. Lol"
2.0,Was not true to size to big for my 4 year old that wear a 5 but it fit my 2 year old other than that looks as pictured.
2.0,"Faded, opaque iron on decal that’s crooked. Also the stitching of the hat to the bill is sloppy and crooked.<br />All in all, I would say it’s worthless."
2.0,This dress was another fail for me. Although not horrible. It was a tad small around the chest.  If your boobs are on the smaller side this dress may work for you.  It's very basic but sometimes that's what we need.
2.0,Didn’t like how the item rolls down on my stomach area
2.0,"Yes this is heavy and yes it is thick, but you need a very small wrist for this to fit. It doesn’t fit around my wrist at all. If it were two inches longer it would be fine, but I can’t even get it close enough to close the clasp. Another problem is the chain itself very easily kinks up.<br /> If it were bigger it’d be better, as it is this is way too small."
2.0,The design is really nice and the color as well. I got a small and it was just a little bit too loose at the top. However the material wasnt what i expected but it was a good buy.
2.0,"This is very cute, but the quality is very low. I didn’t like how the fabric on the jacket was on the sheer side. It’s made of cotton, so it is attracting lint like crazy. The jacket and shirt fit fine, but the pants were way way way too long."
2.0,"I love the pattern and stretch of this one of a kind watch band for my Samsung Gear Sport, however I should of known better than to see the other reviews about the size being too big or loose and still order one. I wish there was a smaller fit one it would be far more acceptable then. Also, sadly the band, although nice and stretchy and breathable, it snags too easily. My 2nd day of wearing it and being cautious and aware of it, and still managed to snag it on something.  Since it's woven I'm worried the snag could unravel some of it or even all of it."
2.0,It feels and looks a bit cheap but the design is nice nonetheless.
2.0,They were too small for me so I gave them to a friend who has small hands and works cleaning houses. What she liked is that they are good for cleaning showers and keeps her arms dry.
2.0,The fabric is thin and the eyes and paws are not well attached. For the price it is Maybe OK
2.0,"This is not the light, flowy material that the picture shows. Not buying this brand again."
2.0,Broke the first day I used it.
2.0,"The plastic mouth piece does not stay in, many attempts to glue it with hot glue resulted in super glue being needed."
2.0,"Fit ok, but sewing was not quality."
2.0,"I really liked these they were comfortable and I even started to buy a second pair but couldn’t get them now I’m glad because they were great at first but then the right one just started coming apart at the seem, very disappointing!"
2.0,"This blouse was really cute, but if you’re busty the seams cut across the middle of the bust line. I ordered an XL because I read it ran small. It fit fins everywhere but the bust. Sadly, i had to return it."
2.0,"Very flimsy! Lenses were loose upon arrival, after some adjustment they are ok."
2.0,Only one out of 3 worked. One was also scuffed within the package and had dirty marks all over. Will be returning as this is obviously old stock.
2.0,I thought it would be longer and baggy it fits but not loose. also the print sticks together after drying. still cute
2.0,"I like North Face and Columbia outdoor wear. I saw this and figured trying it because of nice color pattern and possible nice quality because of the price. This thing is really disappointing in terms of quality. It’s thin and not even soft. This brand is even more expensive than North Face, but quality is not even comparable. This sweater is just not worth the price.<br /><br />Be a wise consumer. I think this is one of those cases that makes you think you’re getting more because you’re paying more, but its completely opposite. If you want to flaunt or brag about the clothes you wear—how expensive they are—then, this might be a product for you. But if you want practicality and better worth for your hard-earned money, buy something else. This is NOT IT."
2.0,The chain was too big to put the cross and heart on it! Bummer😫
2.0,Product is cheaply made too expensive and too small
2.0,"Super light & cool, but the material is poorly fastened. The first time I bent over the straps broke. Very disappointing!"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:430934d21ce1a87b331ab9b6aa78420b]] I got this as a gift. Within a few days of wearing it, the watch began fogging up during hot days. Sometimes it dogs so bad you can’t read the time!!! I notified Neff (manufacture) and they asked for an order number. Ummm, I just told you... it was a gift! I’m not about to ask gifter for that! This pic is very clear that their product evidently has a design flaw. Just trying to let everyone know prior to purchasing that their company doesn’t stand behind their products. I left a review on their main website... but surprise, surprise! They didn’t post it!! So I’m going to leave this here."
2.0,"It fits everywhere but is super tight and it feels like Im a fish trying to fit into a plastic ring, if you catch my drift. Everything else is fine except for the waistline part."
2.0,Way too small and I have small ankles!
2.0,"We ordered the pineapple one (size 10 but tag says 12?) but received the other palm leaf one. That's fine and could have been fixed. But I had my daughter try it on to see if we wanted to return it and get the correct one. It did not fit her. She is 10.5 years old, weighs about 60 lbs, and has a girth of about 48 inches. It was too small girth wise and then too big around in chest, waist, and hips. The chest area is also padded which is not necessary for her at this point. So the suit could work for girls with smaller girth measurements and larger hip, waist, chest measurements. Maybe."
2.0,"Well, these socks ARE adorable.  I was surprised by how small they are, but I wasn't concerned because they stretch comfortably. However, after wearing them one time, I discovered the heel is already starting to wear through.  This could be because they're meant for people with smaller feet (I wear a women's 8.5) but that wasn't clear.  I'm letting my four year old wear them now - they are too big on her but she loves them, and hopefully they last a little longer when they aren't stretching at all!"
2.0,Too small and over priced
2.0,"The bag was ok, useful in the airport, but out and about it was a hindrance. And the little gold knob was scratched the first day out. I will probably just use while in airports and have some other bag packed in my checked luggage."
2.0,These are soft that is the only positive on these capri leggings.  The color is not khaki but clearly grey.  They a super small and even though they stretch they are way to tight.  I am a size 8 they are supposed to fit up to a 12 but look like they are made for a pre-teen that is not bigger than a 4.  Very disappointed.  Will be returning.
2.0,"Great... for ONE time use. As other reviews have stated, they run very easily. They were a tad big; I am 5'6&#34;, 142 pounds. The colors were great. Very versatile.<br /><br />I've only worn each pair once, and three of the five pairs have long runs in them. Very cheap quality."
2.0,Very cheap quality for the amount I spent. Feels like regular basketball shorts material. Left pocket already had a hole in the mesh. Pretty disappointed in the quality
2.0,"I should have listened when I read reviews. The straps don’t stay up. Fit was ok through the bodice. But top was too big. Overall I didn’t like the dress, hubby said I looked like Little Miss Muffett. Swing and a miss!"
2.0,Very awkward. Tons of room in the crotch area.
2.0,"One sleeve is shorter than the other (think a capped sleeve vs a short sleeve) and the necklace is plastic meant to look like metal. Overall, very cheap look and feel. Would not recommend."
2.0,"Purchased both silver and gold chain harnesses... looks pretty, but BREAKS EASILY! Not for woman who are busty or larger than a size 5."
2.0,Received top with no bottoms.<br /><br />TFJH E Long Sleeve Swimsuits for Girls Bikini Rash Guard Set Bathing Suit Flower LightBlue 152/15...<br />Contacted seller to make it right but haven't heard back.
2.0,The size of thesmaller
2.0,felt large and small at the same time
2.0,"The 2 stars is for misleading advertising. The milanese gold is NOT a pale pink, more like a bronze color.  I even double checked my packaging to verify that it was the milanese gold product because it was so different than its picture... That being said it was decent quality for the price, and I like the product and will keep it. Paired well with a bronze watch interface for a more feminine look for the watch. Again, it is difficult to by stuff online and I think companies should do their best not to misrepresent what they are selling."
2.0,Waiting for lens to be made  Have not had an opportunity to use product.
2.0,Save your money! Buy a bag of men’s tanks... it’s thin and cheap...
2.0,"Ties are like a mile long, not a cute look to have them hanging out the bottom of your top."
2.0,Most of the shorts were too big.
2.0,Just has a yellow tint. I couldn't see the difference with on coming lights while driving.
2.0,It's definitely not as cute as the photo. I was very disappointed when I opened it.
2.0,"These glasses are lightweight, but one of the lenses from each pair popped out within one month.  Had to return."
2.0,"This is labeled as children's sized, but it is way too big for my children. It also reeks of chemicals. Probably fine for one Halloween  based on the quality of construction."
2.0,"Ordered these in the pink and gave them to my six year old daughter for Children's Day... and already, with less than two weeks of being worn (exclusively in the house) the pink fabric is flaking off to reveal an ugly brown material underneath. I find this to be utterly unacceptable. I didn't expect these to last forever, but to not even last a few months seems outrageous and smacks of poor quality control / design issues.<br /><br />Very saddening as they really were the cutest slippers for my bear obsessed child - who is now crying because they are already falling apart."
2.0,Was see through and very itchy.
2.0,Very beautiful but even looking up what size would fit me it was still too small
2.0,Could not use the silent button on the side of my phone with this case.
2.0,Poor quality. Just suited for home cooking.
2.0,"&#34;Get what you pay for&#34; the leather like coating began to peel off within a week, which indicates to me it is fake leather."
2.0,They Broke  and the metal changed color after only a month of use
2.0,"This feels like it's cut to fit a keg with short arms. Sleeves bind, binds under the arms, flares out over the waist and hips. Materials and construction are good, but they have to figure out the fit."
2.0,The sandals were beautiful they just didnt fit me but I would recommend for others
2.0,"so like, i didn't know there was only going to be one earring."
2.0,"Not great, not very soft, very thin, weird shape."
2.0,"Ordered size according to chart, but much too small."
2.0,"disappointed, the sandalwood smells funny. Bought  a similar one from another company, and it's much nicer. sandalwood more fragrant and nicer smelling."
2.0,This dress had so much potential but the built-in bra fit terribly.  It provided no support to my 36D breasts and made me look like an old woman. Its a shame as it is pretty fabric and nice red color. Perhaps this will work for someone is a A or B cup.
2.0,I knew this would run small so I ordered the next size up but it's still doesn't fit. Love the Look but will return it.
2.0,"High quality materials, looks like a high end piece. seems put together well bit lasted just over a year, completely dead now. Lots of reviewers only got a few months out of it. Probably not your best choice."
2.0,"The concept is great and the belt looks nice, but really annoying trying to get it to slide back out of the belt loops when you take it off. It catches on the loops."
2.0,Fit great and material is great. However mine came discoloured in multiple places. It has a burnt out look in some places
2.0,"These are awful! Super thin cotton with no spandex. Tight around thighs, baggy around calves and waist. Just terrible. Totally see through."
2.0,"Not the original thick socks , I was expecting. Not same as meijer Fila socks."
2.0,"The color and style of this bikini is beautiful; however the top is much too small and the bottom much too large. I ordered a Medium, but I must say that when I can, I usually buy a Med top and small bottoms whenever I purchase a bikini from Victoria's Secret for example. My bust size in 34DD/36C, and I have a very thin lower body, so maybe a girl with smaller chest and larger booty could for perfectly into a Med. Overall, its a beautiful looking suit!"
2.0,I’m returning the item due to it being too small. Ordered a larger size 4X on purpose because usually most items run small compared to US sizes. I received a 3X instead.
2.0,"All the rings and a hoop came through, but I didn't get the retainer :/"
2.0,Seems cheap especially for the price
2.0,"Very thin, very short, very disappointed"
2.0,"Not Full Grain Leather.  It is leather, yes, but not Full Grain as described.  Disappointing and would not recommend."
2.0,"They are extremely long.  My kids refuse to wear them.  Bottom of shorts goes just used their knee caps.  They are both 5’9 and about 130 lbs.  purchased size 18. Fit in hips. Had to adjust waist.  I washed them hoping they would shrink some since they are 100% cotton.  They one time I want a piece of clothing  to shrink and no such luck, so I guess that’s a positive.  Now I’m stuck with these🤦🏻‍♀️"
2.0,"Wayyyyyy smaller than I expected. Basically child size. Unless you're very small, I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,The skirt is about 9 inches shorter than the picture suggests. NOT HAPPY. I am returning it. So I just lit a match to $4 for return shipping. Sigh...
2.0,Sizing is very different than that of typical toddler sizing.
2.0,"Pockets are huge, shorts overall just weren't what I was expecting"
2.0,Charm is still nice and pretty that was the main reason I purchased for a gift. Embarrassed to see the flimsy thin chain broke during sleep
2.0,The quality was nice but the shirt ran extremely small
2.0,See through. Super disappointing
2.0,"Poor quality, you can see the stitching in the front of the dress. Looks like a high school sewing project."
2.0,"cheap cheappp, but i do like that it's polarized.  it's easy on the eyes when driving!  other than that, i doubt these glasses will last a few months... all the trimmings and attachments feels very weak.  the plastic on the glass also feels very cheap."
2.0,It tangles a lot :-(
2.0,Uncomfortable I gave these to Goodwill because I couldn't return them. They cut into your ankles with no sign of becoming flexible.
2.0,The zippers are pure crap. Otherwise these are super comfortable and great shorts.
2.0,"I ordered them for a friend and she said they were really baggy around the ankles, and also that the quality wasn't as good as she expected."
2.0,It fits perfectly.  The material is inferior to the band that comes with the watch and mine broke within a week of gentle use.
2.0,"This dress has a loose area over the belly where the ruching is, so if you have a bigger belly, this will work. If not, you'll have this baggy/weird bunching of loose fabric. Did not work on my body. 5'8&#34; 140lb"
2.0,well made 2which is why it got two stars. Over priced and too large. I will be returning it.
2.0,For the price? Yeah it's alright but it rusts and turns all nickley after a while
2.0,"I am disappointed in both the fit and quality of the material. The fit is much too loose ans baggy for a fitted low rise jean. Additionally, the fabric is very thin abd cheap feeling. I would not recommend this item at any price."
2.0,No quality control...I received today and not happy with purchase. Socks were 3 different lengths and sizes and strings hanging out. I dont understand were all the 5 star reviews came from but what I received will be a 2 star because they were the correct colors. I will be returning.
2.0,Rope broke from ring within only two weeks.
2.0,"Although this wallet is very beautiful and exactly as advertised, I returned it because I found that it was difficult to get my credit cards out of the slots - it was a very tight fit. Additionally, the zipper pull on the interior coin purse would frequently interfere with the opening of the main zipper. So it is a nice wallet, but it didn't work for me."
2.0,"This dress did not fit at all, the slip underneath barely covered by butt, horrible material."
2.0,To thick and it bulges when you put only 8 credit card in it
2.0,I was very disappointed in the color of the hat and the size of the earrings.
2.0,Bathing suit runs HUGE!
2.0,Rode up while running.
2.0,"I was looking for a slipper that offered the kind of support my feet need which is quite a bit. I thought that a so-called"" orthotic"" moniker might actually be helpful particularly at $79. I was wrong. The slipper appear to be well made and offered several different inserts for the removable sole to help take up space or whatever in different dimensions but the top was really floppy and offered no support whatsoever. The solo at bottom part of this slipper seem to be pretty good but it didn't allow for my orthotic they stuck out in an odd way and my feet flopped around in them. If you manage to get the right size and your feet don't need a whole lot of support these would probably be a good choice but an expensive choice."
2.0,Pretty shirt. Lousy material omg.
2.0,"Great price and could be a cute dress, but the top lays funny. The cross over part doesn't quite go over breast and looks tight if under breast. The straps aren't quite in the right spot and the baggy part looks odd. The top material is a bit thin so getting the right bra is difficult. The color of the skirt is white with some pink in the sequins. I wish it fit more properly as it is a cute dress. And note- it is not just that it didn't lay right on me. I ordered one for me and my daughter-in-law and we both had the same problem, and we have different body styles."
2.0,Not easy to put on. Returned.
2.0,The ruffle and shirt are two different tones
2.0,I purchased this product and after u wear it few time the fit is not the same and does not don the job
2.0,"I really liked the material, it was made well.  However it ran very small."
2.0,"I am not at all overweight,  but the spaghetti straps on this bra leave DEEP indentations in my shoulders.  One strap, no matter how many times I've straightened it out, keeps twisting around, which almost cuts into my skin.bvi bought this as a sleep bra, but it's way too uncomfortable!  Also, the removable pads are entirely too small.  Huge ddisappointment!  The only thing I like about this bra is that it makes my breasts look much fuller/wider, without making them stick out further.  Wish i could figure out how to get all of my bras to do that!  I will try swapping the small pads with larger ones taken from old bras, but the strap issues confound me!  Short of a miracle,  this is going back."
2.0,Waited 35 days for these items to be delivered. Quality was so -so. Grade C .
2.0,"I tried to use the measurements to get the right fit, but I don't think the inner height measurement is correct.  My glasses clunk around in this.  The rectangle shape makes this worse.  It should be tapered.  And it's too heavy."
2.0,"These looked great out of the package - they were nice and thick/opaque and looked like a nice quality. Unfortunately, they ripped across both thighs on the second wearing. A ballet class doesn’t exactly lead to rough usage, and even so, across the thighs is an odd place to rip if the garment was well made."
2.0,The slippers say they fit kids' shoe sizes 13-4; however that was not the case for us. Our son is a size 3 in the US and these slippers were too small.
2.0,closure is hard to work. Stars are too small
2.0,"Like I said,  its nothing like their pictures and if you have a bigger head its even worse."
2.0,Love this in the picture -- the earings sent are not open like shown all on piece which makes it very dark. upsetting. i feel in love with the picture not so much what was delieverd.. Might be cause i got a size 2 but no where does it say the openess around the stone is actually inclosed. :(
2.0,I don't like the gold color.  It appears well made.  The Thai gold is not for me.  Returned it.
2.0,"It was very small and short, thin material."
2.0,"The top was a size too small and the fabric is not soft @ all. The length is short, which was OK b/c I wanted a shorter top to go over long skirts. The lace was pretty. The buttons are plain white flat buttons. I would not buy this top again."
2.0,These were like 40 dollars cheaper then the ones I usually buy. The other ones are made better and fit  better
2.0,"THESE WERE NOT HOW THEY LOOKED WHEN THEY ARRIVED,I KEPT THEM CAUSE I HAD A SIMILAR NECKLACE TO MATCH ""THEY WERE BLACK...NOT HARDLY THE COLOR HERE.......VERY DISAPPOINTED"
2.0,The cup size was way too small. When I put a cover up over it my chest looked misshapen and weird.
2.0,"I liked this band until I realized, too late, that it comes off very easily. The magnets are fairly strong when sliding the band over itself. However, if one end of the band is peeled away by anything -- like a piece of clothing -- the band almost instantly gives way. That's what happened to me: I was walking down the street and took off my hoodie, which caught the edge of the band and undid it almost instantly. My Apple Watch tumbled to the concrete and left a nasty mark.<br />Also, even though I've only had the band a short while, it shows signs of wear."
2.0,"While the waist was fine - the 'cut' of the pants is much more appropriate for folks with a huge bottom.<br />Since I'm pretty slender, these just did not work"
2.0,"...if I *were* (take note) an elementary schooler who still utilized the childish term &#34;poop,&#34; as well as incorrect grammar."
2.0,Hoop is gold. Heart part is painted on with pink paint that chips. Not well made.
2.0,Didn't really like the quality of the denim and it fits kind of small
2.0,The chain it comes with is much thicker than the one in the pictures so it is very hard to put the ring through and take it out as well. You have to force it! The ring sits perfectly but I had to change the chain for the ring to glide in.
2.0,"These are the prettiest earrings ! Super simple and just the right sparkle with the few gems added. I love these. They are comfortable for daily wear and to sleep in,  and don’t irritate my sensitive ears. Great purchase !<br /><br /> Came packaged nicely and also seem like quality earrings. My daughter loves mine so much she wants her own. Will purchase again!<br /><br />Edited to add , after about a week of wear this happens to my ears. I cannot confirm these are actually nickel free.  They could be coated but contain nickel metals underneath as this is a common breakout I have when wearing nickel containing jewelery. A shame too because these are so cute. 😑"
2.0,This dress is kind of weird. After reading the reviews i was worried the sleeves would be too small so i ordered one size up. When it came in my arms fit fine but the rest of the dress was just too big. If i would have got a medium the arms would have definitely been too small. I eneded up returning it and found the perfect dress with cap sleeves
2.0,"Cheaply made, stitching fell apart after a couple uses"
2.0,"Fit is a little too big, one of the “x” lines isn’t fully straight"
2.0,"The fabric was to crinkly even though it looks like silk. It just looked too much like a little girls party dress for me. It would be cute maybe for Christmas, but not worth something to me."
2.0,"The shorts(shorts, really) are way past my knees. Besides being unexpectedly long, they fit fine and they're made well. I just dodgy expect them to be so long."
2.0,"I really wanted to wear these, because for the short time I had them on, they were really, really toasty.  That part is good.  But for comparison, I wear a 12 in the Amazon jeggings (yeah, yeah, I know we're not wearing jeggings but I love those things) and the 4XL in these pants were just slightly too snug for comfort and I couldn't talk myself into keeping them.  And the back of the waistband really didn't come up high enough, either.<br /><br />They're short, too.  The only place these gapped were at the too-short ankles."
2.0,"Gorgeous, but heel is not sturdy, and front wrap was too large. Returned them"
2.0,"Suppose to be fleece, but it is so thin it will not keep you very warm.  The inside is slightly brushed to give a fleece appearance but that is where it ends."
2.0,The quality of the boot is poor. Feels Like I'm walking in a cardboard box. Very uncomfortable.
2.0,The neck is way too big the the sleeve openings around the wrist are the same. Looks like a ladies sweater.
2.0,I obviously didn't pay attention to the dimension of the earring....They are LARGE.....aside of that  2 of the stones came out.
2.0,"I’m usually a medium, so I order it med. I tried it on and it’s way too small. Really disappointed I can’t even wear these."
2.0,Chain broke after two days of gentle wear.  It is nice for what it is.  The pendant is nice.  My daughter likes to carry it around pretending it is treasure.
2.0,I bought the largest size and it fits extremely small and snug. I think the sizes are China size. Order up 2 sizes.
2.0,"much greener in real life, thought the frame was almost clear with green titnt in small areas"
2.0,The large fits more like a extra small
2.0,"this sweater is shorter and smaller and the arms are very small, it is ok maybe if you are a womans medium to get the oversized look."
2.0,I’m 5’2” & the small was like an XL. The only thing that was a small were the straps. Everything else was huge! Please make this true to size & I’ll re-order it.
2.0,Very thin. Will bend when picking up heavy stuff
2.0,"The description states ""【Instructions】With elastic strap for easy and convenient wear"".  Neither mask has an elastic strap. I specifically ordered these masks for an elastic strap. I do not want to have to tie and untie every time I want to take off and on.  Masks are pretty but I will probably return and order something else due to this."
2.0,The cross crosses in the middle are much wider than shown in the image provided
2.0,"They do not cover the ball of my foot like the picture shows. I like them - they work as good as any other non-sock sock works. I wouldn't have bought them if I had seen them in person first. Since I have them, I use them."
2.0,"Neopren material is not elastic and strong enough to stay on the helmet for long. After my 3rd ride on highway speeds the wind pushed it down and off the helmet. I'll have to find a way to affix it to the helmet or increase the friction, but the shape of the helmet makes it hard to keep an elastic band permanently affixed in that position. Good idea for slow speed rides, but not a long-term solution as the neopren material will wear out quickly."
2.0,Es mas pequeña de lo que la talla real
2.0,Scale bodice is really short... I guess my abdomen is too long because I had to pull real hard to cover my chest.
2.0,I have several pair of these in the exact style and size from the Journee website. I have NO idea why these fit like this. I ordered them because the were an EXCELLENT price compared to what I typically pay.  When they arrived the inside lining is different from the others and the fit is poor. I reached out to the seller who authorized a return but I lose $12 in shipping! That shipping cost was ridiculous in the first place but I thought the low cost of the shoes made it worth paying.  I hate wasting money! I would love to send them back and have my shipping cost reimbursed as well. Wouldn't recommend buying these!
2.0,Probably good for a small person or child.
2.0,"Whoever made this (somewhere in China) clearly don'ts understand what its used for, so they made a very pretty bag, but the pockets inside are totally flat (they would hold a couple of pieces of paper at best, so there is no way to put any products in them, you would have to put the products on-top of the pockets, un-supported (so would fall out if you hang the bad, making this just a regular bag, not a hanging bag at all."
2.0,"As with clothing made in China, it's too small. Also, a lot more flowery than it appears - too girly for the person in question."
2.0,"...when they arrived, those nose pads had already fallen off. They're way too uncomfortable to wear without them but the pads won't stay on when I try to reattach them. Just got them and they're already useless. Will stick to sojos from now on..."
2.0,"The title says &#34;button shaped&#34;, but the photos are misleading in that the pearls appear round. Even in the photo of the angled earing, the pearl appears round. What arrived was in fact button shaped, and looks button shaped when angled like the earing is in some of the photos. I returned the earrings."
2.0,"Looks better in picture. The colors are dull in person... has a faded look .. not worth the price, but I'm a Heath Ledger fan so I'll keep it"
2.0,"i wanna give this set five stars because its so cute and super soft and looks just like the photos but the xxl is not even close to plus size. i’m a 16/18 42DD bra and the bra fit like half my boob. the bottoms are truer to size, but still a little small to be high waisted on someone my height, 5’9."
2.0,The owl was much smaller than I was expecting it to be. Still cute though!
2.0,"While these are super cute, they unfortunately did not last long. I was very careful to ensure I did not get them wet and despite this, they still turned color within a month of use. I am definitely bummed because I loved the style and they fit perfect! But if they don’t last more than 30 days of wear, I can’t recommend them."
2.0,way too big.  I can't wear it.
2.0,The plastic inside is harding my son's nose and eyes
2.0,"The shirts were very stretchy with not so little compression. It had lots of air flow, however compression was what I was looking for."
2.0,Order a medium which is my normal size and it was snug in the hip/butt area-not flattering at all. Sadly I missed the window so I cannot return it!
2.0,"Cups are low cut and revealing if you are big breasted, and it gapped at the sides of the cups on me. Looked bad on me but bottom part was nice. There is a bra with underwire inside. I need to return this"
2.0,I started wearing these on 4/1 When my son was born. I love the easy access these give for breast feeding but I am extremely disappointed that the inserts already started falling apart after only a few days. If the inserts didn't fall apart I would give these tank tops 5 stars!
2.0,"Although my daughter likes this sweater, I am very disappointed with it. It is very thin and shorter than the picture shows. The hood is very small and is not wearable. It is definitely not the quality and look that the pictures show. I ordered a size medium. My daughter usually wears a small."
2.0,A little cheap looking but good for the price. Bought the earrings also. Probably be okay for my daughter.
2.0,Personally don't like adjustable ring
2.0,"When i followed the requirements on the sizing the product showed up smaller than what was ordered, Nice product just way to small"
2.0,"I’m M/170lbs/5’5, I ordered the medium shirts and when I tried them on, only one of the shirts fit as a medium. The other two SAID medium on the tag but there’s NO WAY. They were large if not extra large. They hung off my body and barely covered my chest. The medium fit perfectly, I love it. If only the other two had come the same way."
2.0,The front of the hat is really nice then I saw the lettering on the back when they weren’t in the pictures put provided. I’m upset about it
2.0,"Fits great, comfortable, but shirt came in stained"
2.0,"I don't know about these overalls... I bought an XXL (I wear a size 14 in dress/pants), because I saw a lot of reviews saying to go up a size, but when I tried them on they were WAY to big! Also, the material seems very cheap and shiny. I'm not sure if it was the fact that they were 2 sizes to big, but they looked like I was wearing an apron! I feel like the buckles on the straps made the overalls look very cheap. Overall, not to happy with the sizing or cut/style of these."
2.0,Mine haven't held up well and we're never very warm
2.0,"I ordered a 2XL but it was small, upset about the size"
2.0,The material was very cheap looking.  I  was not  pleased.
2.0,"Pretty, but smaller than I expected."
2.0,Cute pants. Ran small. I had to return.
2.0,Very thin material. Tore the cargo pocket when I tried to put my wallet in.
2.0,"Thought the shoulders would be fun. They are very oversized. Cut is not as shown. Looked like I was wearing my Dads jacket. Decent fabric, great color."
2.0,"The fabric and color are really nice but the problem with the fitting. It's waaaaaay toooo small. I don't understand in what sense this size is classified as large. I am 5'8 , 143lb yet the shoulder is too small and the sleeve is like 2/3 if my arm length. Looks extremely weird. It would be great for someone who's extremely short or have very short arms. All in all the sizing suck but feels nice on the skin"
2.0,"Wore them once, then washed them. The zipper broke and the button came unsewed. I was pretty upset by the poor quality, because these are pretty comfy!"
2.0,It was cool at first but very cheaply made. The sole came apart from the shoe in about a month. Had to throw them away
2.0,"Very poor quality, leather is super fine and nice but they forgot to reinforce with an underlayment so it got torn apart at first try."
2.0,Cant wear anything but tank top underneath or every wrinkle will show.  Extremely stretchy and hard to hold it's shape.
2.0,Cute but too small. Order one size up. Fabric is also a little shiny. Colors are pretty though.
2.0,Love it except there is visible glue by the stone.
2.0,"I really liked this product.  Unfortunately, after less than one month of normal use, the band popped.  It wasn't too tight on me, I didn't wear it while asleep or in the shower,  it just unraveled and broke on my wrist."
2.0,Fabric heavier than it looks on the page.
2.0,"The dress was such great fabric, so pretty, but so so short. I’m 5’10”, and the dress didn’t even make it below my butt. Such a bummer."
2.0,Beads are red and not the color shown
2.0,"It's a cute dress just not for my body type. I'm 5'3"", 135, and a double D chest. It makes me look heavier than I am. It also runs a little big."
2.0,It did not help with car light glare. I was able to get a refund.
2.0,I ordered this in my size and it came way to small
2.0,No way to wear a backpack or fanny pack with it so I returned it.
2.0,"Nice top.. Just too clingy for me. If I would have order up, it would have been too big.. Gave it to granddaughter. She loves it."
2.0,I liked the style and size of earring the zodiac chain link broke with in 1 week wear
2.0,Fabric feels cheap and scratchy
2.0,I needed to order two sizes smaller they are very big and thin. I where a 2x I guess i needed a large.
2.0,Cute outfit but if you’re a B cup or smaller the sleeves will just slide right off of you! If you’re not well endowed there’s nothing keeping the top and sleeves in place.
2.0,Ordered and received a large but fits like a small.
2.0,"I've ordered three of these. They are pretty cool, until they break. Two of the three broke within the first couple of months. At least they look cool."
2.0,"The bag arrived with a missing a light, and none of the lights lit up. The hat would fit an adult, not my toddler. Too bad because the bag is really pretty."
2.0,"This was made for someone with no torso. Seriously, I'm only 5ft and have shorter torso. Trying this on made me laugh as the bust area barely stretched to to the chest area."
2.0,The small fits like a large. Nice soft fabric but it loses its shape the more it is worn. If you do not mind the loose and slouchy fit it will be fine.
2.0,I just got the mask and it to small on my head and it feel like it made for kids for it don't go down far on my neck and it hard to see though
2.0,Very faded design hardly showed up
2.0,Product is as ordered.  Just mot as pretty as the picture.
2.0,"The waist fit, was pretty tight, but made my hips look huge. It's more for thinner people. I'm a size 12, slightly overweight but not too much."
2.0,This came quickly but is very low quality. The stones were faling out in the plastic bag before we opened it.
2.0,Thick and comfortable with a very cute pattern. Very warm too. BUT...what is the deal with the large slit in the cap? It’s not shown in the photos for the product. I couldn’t wear it slouchy because of the gaping hole! Not what I wanted and so I will be giving these away.
2.0,"I’m a petite US size 4-6 (5’5 & 132lbs)- after reading the sizing chart and reviews, I ordered the XL. It’s tight on my hips and large on my chest- add the battery pack that rides low and I look and feel pregnant. That being said, for the moment it does heat up. Last year I had a heated vest made from neoprene and it fit nicely and followed feminine curves. Unfortunately, I only got one season out of it- these things don’t last long."
2.0,Very disappointed that the sleep wear was not fire retardant.
2.0,"Cool design, but the hat itself is way too tall. I looked like Pablo from Backyard Sports, but not in the cute way."
2.0,They were  snug but the problem was they were too short
2.0,Poor quality fabric. Thin enough to see through and runs large. I'll be returning
2.0,This shorts were really disappointing.  The construction appears to be quality but I'll never be able to test it because they are HUGE.  I have a 32 or 33 waist and mediums (especially with elastic waists) are never a problem.  I can't even use the draw string to keep these thing on.  Sad.  I really wanted a pair of classic tennis white shorts that didn't drag on the court when I play . . .
2.0,"This shirt is a cute color and a nice loose fit, but the materiel is just weird and stiff and uncomfortable. I will be returning unfortunately."
2.0,Definitely not a 12m more on the 2t range but with an oddly short torso. Cheap fabric and you have to tie the bow yourself. Was super excited for this and am so disappointed.
2.0,"Didn't like the bag, love the customer service."
2.0,"I got a 3X but the inside support cups were tiny, like for a teenager - maybe an A or B cup."
2.0,"I bought this and wanted to love it so much. I love the back being wide and that it closed in the front. However, my husband said that it looked like a a grandma's bra. It did this weird thing where it reshaped my chest. My chest is pretty normal. I wear a 42DD.  This made my chest point outwards and I looked like Madonna. I tried a few different shirts to see if they could hide this but nope. I had to return it. It did fit good though."
2.0,"This is not a high quality dress. It smelled like cigarette smoke when I opened the package, very off putting. I had to wash the dress right away to get rid of the smell. The fabric in the back is very thin and much shorter than the front. I ended up wearing a chiffon kimono to cover up the back. I also ordered one size up and I'm glad I did. The dress is not great quality but I needed something decent to wear to a wedding at 9 months pregnant without having to spend a lot of money. It definitely looks better with accessories."
2.0,"UPDATE: The facets began separating and cracking a few months after I got this—and I don't even wear it very hard or much. A shame… it had such potential.<br /><br />------<br /><br />I bought this because I've been eyeing opal for a while, and it matched what felt right in that stone.<br /><br />The ring is beautiful, with varying patterns of blue, green, and even a touch of yellow, depending on the light.<br /><br />Shipped super fast with the inscription I asked for. Definitely would recommend it."
2.0,"Not the best quality, thin, washed 1x and the ends are unraveling on some. I roll them up as headbands...so it hides it. They work for what I need them for."
2.0,Not a very robust product. Cheaply constructed and falls apart easily.
2.0,It makes me look like megamind
2.0,"My husband loved these slippers. The fit was great and he could wear them indoors/outdoors as advertised. HOWEVER, 2 months after receiving them they have completely split apart and the bottom just hangs off the slipper. So disappointed because he really liked them. Unfortunately, the quality just wasn't there."
2.0,"was delivered in a torn package, dress was all rolled up in a ball.  Returning."
2.0,The velvet material is wrapped around all surfaces of the headband and the material just slips off your head
2.0,Not a true 22mm size. Just falls off the watch.
2.0,"I thought it would be cotton, but it is a very thin polyester. It looks and feels very cheap."
2.0,Bought this for my father but glasses size is too small despite extending the length of the glasses.
2.0,The collar looks funny when you put the shirt on
2.0,The strap is a little short. My wrist is a 7” circumference and it reaches the last two strap holes.
2.0,"I thought I was ordering a band with a magnetic catch.  This was not the case.  It may be a good band but it was not what I thought it was, and I had difficulty closing the latch."
2.0,"Atomic-GREAT- been wanting a CORRECT LADIES DIGITAL WATCH forever...., color O.K. would have put on a metal band, ladies size- bit large but O.K., three letter -day of week -Nice, large size: hour, minute- Good,.. no seconds listed..Not Great- but not a deal breaker, bottom lists: DAY-MONTH with no notation as to what it shows: 30 -10..for 30th of Oct..CAN'T CHANGE  to month- day..as used to..MAJOR DEAL FINISHER--returned watch A.S.A.P.  no year..Not Good..but the unusual listing of day-month finished it for me..SO WANTED TO KEEP..but would have been messed up when day and month numbers were close"
2.0,"I bought the Medium size. The thermal set is soft. But the fabric is thin, not very warm. It is not worth $13 for this. Maybe at half the price. The fit is snug. I have not wash it yet but expect 95% cotton will shrink some. The crew neck is visible if worn under dress shirt with collar open.<br /><br />Update: after washing so far no shrinkage"
2.0,Size chart is way off. Ordered small (5'2/115 larger bust) and it is huge. No option for XS. Nice fabric but returning.
2.0,My granddaughter liked it but over leggings.  Very very thin material. Would not recommend.
2.0,Pretty skirt but way too long than expected.
2.0,A bit on the large Size but what bothers me is that it smells completely😕😤🙀🐭🐟🌁 like sewer and fish
2.0,"fits very tight, dont even have a big head for it to fit that tight, When wearing the letters stretch out"
2.0,"Got it for my wife, the costume came dirty. The vest was fine but the straps were way too big. Returned, but haven’t heard from them with the refund"
2.0,Broke down in less than two weeks. No more clothing purchases thru Amazon for me.<br />Was forced to pay $16.99 to return the item back to Amazon. (UPS) &lt;smh>
2.0,"These boots are Not slip resistant, after cleaning & mopping my floors & the floors just being damp I slipped bit was able to catch myself from falling these are the second pair of boots I bought online that I slipped in the first are Larnmern brand."
2.0,"I ordered this as a gift and my friend said it was enormous.  Unfortunately, no photographic evidence.  LOL"
2.0,Cute but fit weird.
2.0,It was cute when recieved but quickly changed color of metal once wearing. It looks like a demo for a really nice version waiting to be made. It's great for 1 special wear.
2.0,"The shirt is quality made, but does nothing in terms of the primary purpose of making you look slimmer."
2.0,"My son carries his in his pocket about 3 or 4 times a week for the past month since he received it and now it will not stay closed, and we are past the return date on it.  I knew it was a cheap price but I am disappointed with it not lasting more than a month with responsible use."
2.0,"The skirt portion is made out of very stiff material. Even after washing it, it stuck out so far it looked silly. The dress itself is very cute if only the skirt would lay down. I had to return it unfortunately."
2.0,Too small and wrong color sent
2.0,I had this one day when the glass part came off the metal top. The dandelions fell out and never seen them again.
2.0,"This one looked way too small for my face, but looking at the other colors it looked perfect. Sad because I was so excited for these"
2.0,"Swingy & light, but I did not care for the loose fit in waist.  It shrunk a bit in drier."
2.0,Brought this for you 24 year old son. The hat was very large. It did not work form him.
2.0,Very pretty but turned my finger green in a few hours after wearing.
2.0,Was not expecting it to be this small. Will not fit current bracelet- too small
2.0,Size runs small and super thin material
2.0,"The glasses are functional, and could be acceptable with a few caveats.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of oversized glasses so I bought the smaller set. But the hinges aren't designed to expand past the 56mm width of the glasses, which was uncomfortable.<br /><br />The mirroring looks nice in person, but became distracting when driving. I noticed that my fingers on the steering wheel were &#34;ghosting&#34; about 0.25&#34;. The speedometer needle also had a ghost. It only happens at very close distances, probably anything less than 3'. It was distracting enough that I decided the glasses were unsafe for driving.<br /><br />If all you want are a pair of glasses to make you look good, aren't worried about driving with them on, and do have a small enough head ... these glasses are worth a try."
2.0,"I got the necklace as a Christmas gift and chose mainly for the wording listed on the image, but when I received it, it didn’t have that at all. Still a beautiful necklace and served it’s purpose, but I was disappointed on the packaging."
2.0,Ordered a Men’s 30 size waist. Fit more like a 28. All my other pants are 30 waist and fit with room to spare.
2.0,This shirt looks great on but the sizing runs smaller then expected.
2.0,"I'm not really sure what's it's made of, but it's cheap and fringes super easily"
2.0,"Looks incredibly cheap. The ruffle only is in the front, it has a very odd tank top looking lining only in the front as well. Stitched crookedly, cheap material, and an overall fail."
2.0,At least two sizes to small I ordered a 11 and bet it's only a 9
2.0,"Truly the thinnest headbands I have ever come across...ever.  Super light and mostly polyester.  Might work as a fashion look or for less vigorous pursuits but not for folks participating real world activities.  Consider the COSMOS 12-PC Different Color Cotton version.  The colors are extremely vibrant (and that's being polite, a little bleach anyone?) but they are thick and sturdy headbands that will hold up to real world use and abuse."
2.0,Does not look like picture.  Fit was strange
2.0,I'm not very happy because if this side there is a damage dent on the right side. What can you for me about the faulty item.
2.0,Heel feel away from the shoe after only two weeks.
2.0,I really wanted to like this belt but had to rate it 2 stars as the color wasn't what I expected. It's much darker than I expected and I bought it specifically to wear with a tan dress shoes. I can say much more about it because I haven't worn the belt since I got it. I'm very disappointed that the color is not what I expected.
2.0,Had to return it.  It was very tight around the neck and chest
2.0,The title will fool you and so will the picture. I got my glasses and the design is not rhinstones at all but silver painted.
2.0,"I love camo<br />They do run big.... but no drawstring like described in description/name of sweatpants<br />I still like them, they are comfy and cute"
2.0,"The strap is very comfortable but it attracts dustt, lint, and hair like crazy. I'm going to keep it but yeah it's nothing like the apple watch sport band."
2.0,"The material really wasn't the problem, it was comfy. I am 5'8"" and the length was too long (easily could be hemmed up). The biggest problem was that the seam of the top part to the skirt part was just in an odd place. It was way too far below my bust, but not far enough to be at high waist or waist. Maybe if I had DD breasts that sagged it would have filled in all of that space, but I don't, so it just didn't look right. There was no styling I could do to fix the bad tailoring and design measurements. So buyer beware, the dress is not tailored as it is in the photo; that seam is not cutely just under the bust as portrayed."
2.0,"I measured and ordered the XL sleeve, but it won't stay put. It keeps sliding down my thigh and bunching up on my knee joint instead of staying where I put it. I wanted to like this, but I just can't if it won't stay put."
2.0,The straps don't really stay in place.
2.0,I sent this back since it didn’t show much of the ruffle and I like ruffles.
2.0,"I really wanted this watch to be nicer than it is. True, for the price, it’s not too bad. However, it doesn’t live up 5 star reviews. The watch looks descent enough but the drawbacks outweigh the looks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Not overly expensive.<br />2) Looks descent<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) Heavy<br />2) The instructions do not match the watch<br />3) The second hand cannot be stopped when setting the time<br />4) Changing the date reveals that the movement is cheap, the button is pushed and the resulting movement is awkward and you must click through a date of 39<br />5) I cannot read the day of week nor the month (If that is what the other dial is) as the letters/numbers do not have enough contrast agains the background<br />6) I have serious doubts as to this watches durability."
2.0,The skull was already chipping before we even took it out of the bag. Otherwise cute idea
2.0,Looked great for all of five minutes. Then the bows came off and the dog ate it.
2.0,I thought the band would be similar to the picture but what I received was wider with a different clasp. Not bothered by the clasp but I wanted a narrower band like the one pictured.
2.0,"I ended up returning these. They are really cute, if only they would stay flipped up on my earlobe. Kept twisting around and hanging down like regular earrings."
2.0,"I saw lots of reviews says this fit short.  I did not find that to be the case.  It was definitely long in the rear and just overall big.  The material was so-so, more of a slippery poly than chiffon w/ a slight sheen.  For reference I am 5'6"", 130lbs and 32B, I had ordered a small."
2.0,Size not true to as depicted on picture - no return ability RMA issued with delivery
2.0,"Colors are nice, size runs too big. It balled up fast."
2.0,these were not cushy. Not even a little cushy.
2.0,"They're labeled XL, but they fit like a Medium.  I'd recommend getting a size or two larger than you normally wear.  They don't provide full coverage, unless you put them on backwards."
2.0,"Cute, but very cheaply made."
2.0,"I bought these because it was offered in half sizes. I got 11.5, but it did not fit my child’s foot. I checked the size, 28eu which is size 11, not 11.5. Will return."
2.0,Way too big. Buy a size smaller. Returned it.
2.0,"So disappointed, this dress does not look like it appears I will be wearing it around the house or maybe a grocery store run."
2.0,"Works great at protecting my phone so far, but I don't like how high the edges are around the front of the phone. This makes it hard to press the main button on the screen and especially difficult for my phone to recognize my fingerprint. Also makes it difficult when texting as the sides of the case are too close to the keyboard. Scratched slightly from just being placed in my purse; I haven't dropped my phone or let my kids use it. I tried to return but they would only give me a $3 refund...so I kept it and have purchased a different case elsewhere."
2.0,It smelled strong of chemicals.  I returned it.
2.0,"Edit:  I did have the Blossom colored one, and my epi-pen fit in it easily.  However, this one, which I assumed was the exact same bag, did not accommodate the epi-pen, and so I have to return it.  Very sad!  Guess I will look for them in person at Coach stores from now on.  Dropping 3 stars simply because this makes the bag a dealbreaker.<br /><br />From looking at this little gem you would never suspect how much it can hold.  In the front section, I have my epi-pen, a small pill case, and a lipstick; the credit cards that I don't use often, plus a few bills, go in the slip pocket.  There is still room for my car key but I never take that on vacation.  In the back section I keep my iPhone X, and in the card slots, my license and Amex (which I use all the time).<br /><br />At home this bag is not big enough for me, because I also need to carry house keys, and I like to keep a pen and slim little notebook with me, but on trips this is excellent and slips into my carry-on taking up very little room.<br /><br />I have owned 5 of these over the years (just have 2 now) and am continually keeping my eyes out for new colors.  Note that there are some being sold on Amazon with chain straps - these are the ones Coach produces specifically for their outlet stores, and the zippers are cheaper, and the chain straps are a little too short.  The full-price Coach ones have a leather, adjustable strap.  I hope that helps people with their decisions."
2.0,Colors are brutal. Material is okay.
2.0,The ear pieces are really flimsy material.
2.0,Kind of thin material
2.0,"these do not stay on. The little silicone pad helps, but they are always sliding off in my shoes.  I have wider feet and they just cover the edges of my feet and my toes."
2.0,"Much smaller than I expected.  Granddaughters communion gift. She loved it.(8yrs. old).  Smaller than a dime, will definitely go larger on next one."
2.0,"Nice material, but too short. Don't like showing my belly when I serve. Because it is short, it looks very boxy."
2.0,Quality was nice but the cut was way to big for a dry fit shirt. A men's Med should fit me perfectly however this fit like an XL it was down to my knees. The color and patterns was a lot lighter then the image. I know things can be difficult to tell online but I picked this shirt even though it was more money because of the darker pattern but the shirt that came was the very bright sky blue and bright red style as seen in several other Captain America tops.
2.0,"One of the pins broke and now I can't remove one side.  I will probably have to pay a jeweler to remove it and hopefully they can. Yes, I bought my own jeweler tool but I can not get this stupid pin out.  Learned my lesson to never buy cheap products again."
2.0,"Wanted to keep, but the destroyed wash felt very rough on my legs. I wasn’t sure if washing it would soften it up. I liked the fit though. If it goes on sale I might rebuy then wash it. Still looking for a similar style with a softer feel."
2.0,can't wear it
2.0,The material is very cheap and the side fringe is to loose! Makes my stomach look bigger when it’s not! The  side sleeve is to short not worth the price sad because I was going to use this for a family event
2.0,"The shirt was too wide but right length, suspenders were too long, bow tie was not adjustable, and the shorts were a perfect fit. Definitely not worth the price for a china cheapie."
2.0,The thigh cutouts are not anywhere near proportional to the rest of the underwear. Returning immediately.<br />They do seem like they would have been good for after csection if they would have fit though.
2.0,Well it does look like the picture and I will keep it for my niece but I won’t be wearing mine.
2.0,"So... The accent color, or rather the curly filigree is black against a Grey backdrop on the tie in the advertised picture. However, my tie has a Grey backdrop and lighter Grey filigree. It's a beautiful tie. Just not what I ordered."
2.0,No son los colores que se ven en la imagen
2.0,color and material in picture does not match what arrived
2.0,"Looked nothing like the photo. I bought this as a Mother's Day gift, but when I got it I had to buy her something else to help alleviate my shame."
2.0,"I opened this product and was totally disappointed! There were snags and a big furry patch on it,  IDK what that was. I will be returning this item."
2.0,Dress did not look like the photo in person. I didn’t like the material. Felt cheap like a dollar store dress. Returned with no issues. Got the solid black with the white stripe dress.
2.0,"When I received the item, it was halter top that ties in the back.<br /><br />I couldn’t return it because I bought it as a last minute top to go out.<br /><br />The halter top lasted with 1 outfit.. I washed it and it shrunk.<br /><br />The halter top is small so, size up if you have big cup size."
2.0,Theses bracelets are big they a really to big for me.the adjustable ones will go down to fit but then the strings are long and get in the way.The beads are bigger than I really like.one of the bracelet has already broke and was stretching.
2.0,This was bought as a gift for my nephew’s birthday. Initially the jersey looked great but after my sister-in-law washed the jersey for the first time all the name and number on the back all fell off.<br />Super disappointed 10 year old who only got to wear the jersey twice.
2.0,tHEY WERE BROKEN!  BENT REAL BAD!
2.0,I purchased this thinking it was leather.  When it came I was disappointed in the appearance and it did not look like leather.  I returned it.
2.0,I don’t like it! You have to tape the side down. I won’t order anything else like this.
2.0,I wear slippers in my house cause I don't like wearing outdoor shoes around and I also don't like walking around barefoot on hardwood. Got these cause they were on a deal and looked like they'd be lightweight but still comfy/squishy. For slide type slippers they are narrow. The material also sticks to your feet a bit. They'll still get at least 2 stars from me cause they are cushy enough to walk around the house on hardwood. I'm sure there are other options at the same price point though.
2.0,Beautiful hat but it was shipped folded in four and has permanent creases.
2.0,It doesnt really match the picture you can tell its cheaply made
2.0,The material is scratchy and somewhat see-through. This was not what I was expecting and makes it difficult to be able to wear.
2.0,Fit as expected but the texture of the shirt is extremely thin and feels cheap.
2.0,Wore it for a wedding. It was formal enough and did it's job decently. Just the right length to be cute but not sexy. However my order didnt come with the waist ribbon. It took forever to get an unhelpful response. My mom had to sew one for me;/
2.0,"When I received these, I tried on one pair.  The fit was perfect.  I then popped them in the wash (cold water wash, dried on the lowest setting) and after that one washing was disappointed to find that they are now noticeably tight, causing them to create very visible lines.  I have worn other Hanes cotton styles without encountering this problem.  Can't explain why this particular design shrinks so badly.  The quality is otherwise very nice, so I wouldn't say don't buy them ... but buy them in a larger size than you usually wear."
2.0,I ordered a medium because I used the sizing charge and I was afraid the dress was going to be to small. I’m used to having some room in a dress but when it arrived I put it on and I had about a four inch gab between the size of the dress and my skin. Medium felt more like a large.
2.0,"I don't know why it has good reviews. Ordered a 3xl, because I wear xl (5'10&#34; 210 lbs. size 15/16) and it fit my 10 year old neice. It is pretty and came with littleearrings for free, but i really am disappointed. I've ordered from China before and the sizes are iffy, but never this far off."
2.0,"Good waist bag, but don't expect to fit much in this. Zippers come apart from their track easily. Was disappointed in this purchase. Will be shopping and looking for something different. I would NOT recommend. Save your money."
2.0,Good looking.was very awkward to use due to the fact that neither end will fit through any belt loop you have to remove the end. basically a pain in the ass.I returned.
2.0,Not as pictured AT ALL! But still an ok pair of jeans...
2.0,I wish I could say this was a great product. I bought it to tie-dye and it shrunk too much in the pre wash.
2.0,Seems like good quality but wayyyyy too big
2.0,Running Very big!<br />Chemical smell.<br />Would not recommend. (Sorry)
2.0,"The Moment camera neck strap is sturdy yet lightweight and comfortable. I was looking for a strap that could be adjusted with very little effort. This one does the trick.<br /><br />Update: Falling apart after 3 months of use. While I love the strap, I will have to retire it as my equipment is not safe with the defective strap. I must downgrade my review to 2 stars. The concept is great and the strap is comfortable but the product should last years not months. See photo where stitching is unraveling. I have an email in to Moment. I’ll update when they respond."
2.0,"this thing seemed awesome, until I had it for a few weeks<br /><br />issue: the ""gate"" is weak and can easily unhook to where it will spring out from the clasp<br /><br />result: lost my keys twice, first time I thought was a fluke as I found them by my truck -- then it happened regular<br />unfortunately I didn't take it serious enough at first and lost a full set of keys walking<br /><br />great idea -- VERY POOR execution -- was this ever tested or just shipped to a china shop to fabricate from a CAD model?"
2.0,Didn’t fit my table that it said it would fit
2.0,"Being 100% cotton was my only criteria for purchasing this. I like big nightshirts but this was ridiculous. This was like 6x, not a 2x. I washed it in hot water and dried it on a hot setting. Did not shrink one bit because it's not 100% cotton.  It's made with a ton of spandex or some other VERY stretchy material. Returning.<br /><br />If you don't mind non-absorbent (rayon, bamboo, etc.) material to sleep in, these are well made and washed well. But anyone who normally wears a size 10-14 in street clothes should get a medium in this."
2.0,I thought these would be equivalent to  another brand I have but they are not quite large enough and there is no extra contour for your nose.
2.0,I'm sure it would be very warm and soft if it fit.  I generally wear a L but ordered an XL for some wiggle room.  I couldn't even get this over my head and pulled down over my shoulders.
2.0,Cheaply made in the bra.
2.0,Wouldn’t purchase again
2.0,Comfy but the straps wore out the first use so now it is all stretched out and fits weird.
2.0,I purchased this because I needed a cover up for a wedding. I read alot of the reviews and purchased the size I actually wear (12 -14 Or L/XL). It did not fit it was way too small I should have gotten a 2xl. Im 5'9 and 230.
2.0,"When the hat I ordered arrived in my mailbox, folded, and stuffed into an envelope, my immediate suspension was that this is a hat of a lesser quality.  And, I was right.  The only way I can describe this had is with the word “flimsy.”  Not a good product.  I will have to find another had from a different manufacturer."
2.0,The material was lighter than expected. I received wrong size and color.
2.0,not bad i have been using it for a few weeks now and it is still holding up i would recommend it.
2.0,"The shirts appear to be in good condition and are form fitting. That said, they are certainly not compression shirts. I wear compression shirts for discrete back support under my shirt, so I have others. I got these because it was time to replace a few before gardening season starts. I am wearing one right now. While the fit is snug, but stretchy enough to be comfortable, it is not truly a compression garment. If that is your need, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
2.0,"I find these quite ugly in person. Also, the color said tan but you can see on photo these are clearly gold. I also question whether they are truly polarized lenses. There is no curve at all to the lenses so a lot of sunlight gets in through the sides of the glasses. I do not think there are worth the price at all."
2.0,Really cute but they are super see through.
2.0,"Arrived undamaged, on time, and well-packaged.<br />Fits great everywhere: around shoulders and across chest is smooth, relaxed around waist, drapes nicely at hips and thighs. Lands around 2-3 inches above knees. The dress is well-sewn and the color is as expected (a deep red).<br /><br />The problem for me is the gaping at the lower part of the armholes. There is at least an inch which can be folded over, it is flappy. I will need to cut an inverted triangle and sew it up to wear. As stated, the fit across chest and shoulders is smooth and form-fitting (not body contouring, but certainly not loose), and this is why the extra material is surprising.<br />5’4”, 100lbs, 30D-24-35"
2.0,"Cheaply made, all earrings broke within minutes- even with gentle application. Necklaces are impossible to get on and off and the shoes fell apart"
2.0,"I was disappointed because I only had the first picture to view and it looked like an opaque skirt. It is actually very transparent from knee down. Photo was very misleading. It's like a mini skirt under a layer of midi. Very disappointed. Waist fit kind of small, but I have to return it bc it's not what I wanted. I also ordered a denim blue (which has a washed look) and what I received what a dark navy blue."
2.0,Too low on top (could wear a tee shirt under it as with a jumper);  too long (could shorten it I guess).  Why I am sending it back though is that the material holds static.  Ugh!
2.0,too short and material is cheap
2.0,"The product arrived with deodorant stains and stains that look wet but don’t feel wet, I’m thinking maybe oil or something? It also had no tags or package other than the Amazon bubble mailer which I thought was odd. The product is nice it’s just unfortunate that it’s dirty and clearly returned or used."
2.0,Itchy inside...can only wear them 5 minutes....beautiful and soft on the outside tho!
2.0,The color posted is not the color I received.  It was more of a greenish blue.  My buttons were not sewn on well. Lost 4 buttons so I took them all off.
2.0,"Was a lot less cute in person, just looked like I was wearing a sash over a sweater. Mailed it back. Quality was good."
2.0,I sweat in anything but cotton and I was sweating.
2.0,"well you get what you pay for.. Looked very cheese for what I was trying to pull off, not bad but not the set if you want to look classy and well put together."
2.0,"This is defiantly costume material. It’s a cute cut and fits nice but the fabric is not something I would wear other then for a costume.<br />So, if your in need of a costume order away!!!"
2.0,Cute but broke right away!
2.0,"I am 5'5 125lbs.  I ordered a small (black).  It was just a little looser than I expected and also shorter than I expected.<br /><br />The material felt nice, but it was see through, so you would definitely need to wear and undershirt."
2.0,"Application is not fully laid down on this dress, it is not worth the money, very cheap made"
2.0,Barely stay on my ears
2.0,"The short review is that the socks fit as expected but did not last long with normal wear. It's not worth getting pulled into the purchase with the low price only to get the low quality. It's only been months since I received these socks and I'm already back online ordering other, replacement socks given the quickly worn-through toe and heal areas."
2.0,They are ok. Probably will only wear at home.
2.0,"Way too long.  Might work for an adult, but why would an adult need these?"
2.0,"Ok, so I had ordered a lg in blk and white both were extremely tight and small. so I ordered 2 more in x large thinking they would surely fit. Unfortunately they do not! So now I have 4 total that I will be giving away! Taking out the large pads did not help! I am a 36D  and these just are way too tight. Pretty and stylish but run VERY SMALL!"
2.0,"As I unboxed it, the part where the band goes thru and locks, came right off. Managed to put it back together but every time I take it off or it gets caught on something, it comes right off. The pin holding the black metal loop does not hold for anything."
2.0,Not worth anything. Pinches her toes from the sides. Has a strange puckering in toe area.<br />Slippery bottom
2.0,"Although this light is super bright, and uses convenient AAA batteries, it fails in the design department in two ways. First, the plastic clip is somewhat weak and doesn't hold onto items very securely. It will fall off if you are doing anything more than a sedate walk. It should have been a metal clip with a stronger spring. Second, the light enclosure lacks any sort of hole or loop that you could use to lash the light to something convenient."
2.0,They are pretty tight on my kids but do not stay up on their faces. Just a meh product..
2.0,To small not as thick as it looks on line.
2.0,The picture looks nothing like the item that arrived.  This Jacket is a screen printed sweatshirt.  The picture makes it look like it has texture & dimension but it DOES NOT!  I'm keeping it because my 7 year old will still like it fine & would wear a trashbag with Mandalorian on it.  But this item is not what was expected or as pictured at all!
2.0,"The masks were a good size for a petite 7 year old, comfortable. However they look to be 3 layers, not 4. And water did not bead up on the surface like for other surgical masks. This makes their protection questionable and I’m not comfortable with use of them."
2.0,"It’s not very long or thick, so you would be better off purchasing from a fabric store and just wrapping it as a head wrap yourself"
2.0,"These are difficult to put on and take off as the front screws on as well, you end up with just the post and they break easily"
2.0,Size was way too small and very dhort
2.0,This is beautiful lingerie. However it's cheap and poorly made. When I tried it on one of the bones in the corset<br />came out. Then when I put it on for my fiance 2 more of the bones came out which was a little embarrassing. And it's also not made for women with big ta tas. I'm a 38 DD and my boobs were spilling out of it ....and not in a good way
2.0,"Love the idea of this, but what I got seams like plastic ."
2.0,I bought the white and found it too see through.  With the shorts underneath being too short looking odd under the white skort. I cut out the shorts and will use the skort as a bathing suit coverup.
2.0,Gorgeous like the picture but very cheaply made. Broken. Price says it all.
2.0,"The set itself was very cute a stretchy, but it caused me to itch and gave me red bumps even after I washed it."
2.0,Returned because they run smaller than I expected and I could tell it would lose it's elasticity after one or two washes.
2.0,"Super cute dress. Definitely runs on the smaller side, and was a bit tight on me. My problem with this dress is in the way the pockets lay. They bunch out at the hips and make the dress look funny."
2.0,Cheap. Arrived tarnished.
2.0,Not easy to use.
2.0,gets really dirty fast and not the best quality
2.0,"Item looked just like the picture, small and dainty but the metal part irritated my ears. If you have a sensitivity, it's better selecting something else."
2.0,Sent it back. NOT flattering at all.
2.0,Ordered a small and it was much too small and very short waisted..Hard to know which size to ger
2.0,"You can tell it’s cheap jewelry. It’s looks fine from a distance, but when you hold it in your hands you can feel. Works great for bridesmaids gifts though if you have a lot of them."
2.0,"they are nice looking, but nothing special. not worth the price"
2.0,Cheap Material & Too Large
2.0,Material has no body to it.  Very thin.
2.0,Way too baggy and the material is really course.  Overalls offered by other companies on the site are much better.
2.0,"Not too bad. Thought the collar was completely around, but only in the front of the dress, rather odd. Ok for every day play but nothing special. Wasn't really impressed"
2.0,"Not what I was expecting, they don’t clip on tight and the glass isn’t clear"
2.0,I got the leopard spotted glasses.  They are cute.  But they do nothing for me.  The glare is still there.  I even think it may be worse with these.  I am wearing them now.  Everything is a big blur!  And it looks like the screen is a bright white!  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I won't be using them.  I may give them to someone else to see if they work for them.
2.0,Straps on top too short - did not come down over my breasts. Couldn't wear.
2.0,Neat graphic but the nose is HUGE. Definitely not proportionate to someone's face.
2.0,This shirt is from China and runs VERY small. I purchased an XLarge and it still fits like a tight Medium. Also the print had imperfections.I guess I should have known it was an overseas product by the longer estimated ship date.Unless you wear a Juniors size I don't recommend it.
2.0,"The leather is good quality for the price, however the buckle broke after 7 months.  I emailed Benkii a few weeks ago, but never received a response."
2.0,"After one single night of wear, they fell apart. The soles are peeling off. They're cheaply glued together."
2.0,"Right size, however the bottom part was made to short"
2.0,I gave this two stars because the band it self just wasn't fitting around my wrist the way I thought it would I will find myself Re adjusting it a couple of time even when I'm working it and it became very frustrating maybe it works for others but it just wasn't for me
2.0,Go one to two sizes up for proper fit
2.0,Well I received my package and I was excited but when I went to put then in I noticed that the barbell are very short they didn't specify the length of them I.thought they would at least be standard piercing size I will order again only if listing sizes other than that I like the color.of the balls
2.0,Looks super cute but I didn’t like the fit. It felt disproportionate. I’m returning.
2.0,"Odd fit for me. Too small on top and a little big around the hips. I’m 5’7”, 128 lbs."
2.0,you must be a cup size A to fit this dress. It is not made proportional to a real wombs size. The rest of the dress is cut nicely
2.0,"The shirt looks nice but is way to short. I am only 5'5"" and it barely reaches my waist and i haven't even washed it. I even ordered a size larger."
2.0,"no queda bonito,"
2.0,It's a women's turban! My husband looked like a fortune teller! Going back!
2.0,"Comfortable fit for a small adult head, very fleecy texture inside. The leathery logo with Bluetooth controls flashes bright blue so it's pretty obvious that the hat contains a headset unless you cover the light. The controls are easy to locate and use by touch alone. It's also very easy to take out the electronic bits if you need to clean the fabric. There is a small drop-shaped zipper pull in the hem of the fleece, and a roomy pocket with velcro tabs to secure the headphones and connecting wire.<br /><br />Sound is fine for listening to spoken word material or workout music, but the right speaker with the Bluetooth components has a constant high-pitched chittering sound common to many wireless headphones.<br /><br />Bluetooth connection starts to have trouble more than 10-15 feet away, or if any walls come between the unit and your Bluetooth audio source.<br /><br />For those who prefer to hear what's going on around you, these do allow a good bit of outside sound in. Definitely not noise cancelling at all.<br /><br />My unit was an open-box Warehouse Deals package. Was missing the DC 5V Micro USB cable that was described in the manual."
2.0,size chart is not right get 2 sizes up
2.0,What I like is not much it looks very cheap I don’t even like the cheap color gold not worth  it for that kind off money I haven’t even worn it
2.0,"We bought these in a couple of color variations & sizes and they are cheap, boxy looking, poorly stitched shorts."
2.0,Is not the original
2.0,Not water proof as they claim
2.0,"Yarn is extremely cheap and looks awful, terrible quality. Came with snags and loose yarn threads, looks stretched and ratty, gives you a very Walmart look"
2.0,Made me look too big
2.0,"I’m disappointed in this color. I was expecting a hi-viz bright orange.  Instead, it looks like an ordinary orange sweatshirt. I probably will have fade issues with this color. Disappointing."
2.0,the legs are not nearly as fitted as the photo shows.
2.0,It's a little smaller than I thought and the straps don't look sturdy
2.0,"Came much faster than expected but very plastic feeling, that's why I gave only two stars."
2.0,I bought 3 dresses ... two size 8 and one size 11 and the length  barely goes past their knees.
2.0,"The stitching on one side was off, so it had a bulge. Cheaply made, as long as a dress."
2.0,"This shirt does not look as the picture, they attempted to fit the image, but proportion is way off. U can make it work, but not for me."
2.0,It did NOT keep out the rain & my husband was soaked in a matter of minutes.
2.0,"This dress is super cute, but not at all bra compatible. I kept it and wore it thinking I could use the boob tape type bra…nope. Going to try it again with a sweater or jacket and a regular low cleavage bra."
2.0,"I get it, these are cheap sunglasses. But 2 things that I don’t like about them. First, is I feel like the lenses should be a bit more darker from the pictures. I drive into the sunrise going to work, & drive into the sunset returning home. These were not dark enough for my needs. 2nd thing that I didn’t like, is on the first drop of them, the lenses popped right out. I was able to pop them back in, but it surprised me how easy both of them popped out. I’ll add these to my pile of backup sunglasses."
2.0,"Mostly okay, but could not move my arms around. Cheaply made."
2.0,Too large and returned.
2.0,I ordered gray and this was more of a blue. Also the material seemed very cheap. It was made in China
2.0,Fit as expected but so uncomfortable that I returned them
2.0,"Shipping was super quick, but quality is not great. They do no fit an adult size head, even my 14 yr old thought they were tight. Also flat small frames. These may be better for kids around 10-12. Colors are a bit lighter then shown, bt they do each come with a fabric carry bag."
2.0,The top fit perfect but the bottoms have absolutely zero stretch so it makes it look like there’s a huge muffin. I loved the quality tho. Wish I didn’t need to make the shirt too big just for the bottoms to fit better
2.0,"Cons: Size too small, width doesn't compare to the sizing description, lenght too short, fabric not the best, the color transfer.<br />Pros: Style"
2.0,I really loved the idea of this mask and was sad to see it’s very very big.  Just to much fabric. I could have it up to my eyes and it would still fit under my chin lol.  I think it’s cut like this to have the full image but unfortunately it’s just too much fabric to be worn comfortably for me.  Even with a spacer under it I had too much fabric.
2.0,The belt was shorter than the stated size. It is at least 3 inches shorter than advertised when you consider the length of belt looped through the buckle.
2.0,Doesn't fit well. The top is too loose and flappy. No boob hold what's so ever.
2.0,"The dress is cute but too small, I can’t even zip it up on the side. I’m 5’10” - 165lbs and ordered a large. I wear an 8/10 dress size so figured the large would work, sad that it doesn’t. I’ll be returning it."
2.0,"I truly love the design,  but They do make a slight squicky air sound and hurt at the front of the big toe. So Wearing socks might be necessary and or moving one size up."
2.0,Poor stitching. Garment was<br />riddled with unfinished material and support.
2.0,This Dr. Strange costume came with a small rip. It also has two of the same side velcro on the cape so it will not stick. Size was good though. I bought this for my (short) 7 year old.
2.0,"Mine arrived broken, after fixing it with my jewelry tools it broke in a different part. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you."
2.0,"Sloppy fit, I returned it."
2.0,This sweater was exactly what I wanted then after 1 wash the pocket riped and below the neck by the zipper ripped as well. This sweater is cheaply made and it shows. After all of the cheap ones I've purchased I could have bought a better made albeit more expensive one.
2.0,"It is cute but not the photo and runs very small, especially the shirt ."
2.0,"I liked the fit through the body of this dress. The fabric was thick enough to hold me in but I ended up returning it because the top was weird. The ""sleeves"" didn't stay where they were supposed to so I felt like it was just going to keep falling down. I'm large chested (34DDD at VS) but somehow the bust was still too large. When I tried to pull the sleeves up then it was just too tight in the arm area."
2.0,This may be a great TUNIC but this is not long enough to be a dress.
2.0,Just way to big
2.0,"I just received mine, shipping was quick but the overall quality of the sunglasses is subpar. Main problem with mine is the black frames comes full of permanent scuff and swirl marks. In other words they don't look like a brand new pair of sunglasses."
2.0,Sizes are too big
2.0,didnt like it on.
2.0,"I was looking forward to these. They are made in turkey. They quality is not soft nor stretchy. The way the shape and size is, is completely off. Very disappointed. I put them in the donation box. I will not wear something uncomfortable while training."
2.0,"My daughter made me lol. I ordered an extra large as suggested uping in size I normally wear a m/l it fit okay the arms are a bit too big (loose fitting) and the legs as well and it showed an awful camel toe I plan on wearing leggings on top. But I am not even that tall 5'2"" and it just rose up so high. It'll work this time but I don't plan on wearing it again or ordering costumes from this brand again."
2.0,Not what I expected. Cheap made. Very thin.
2.0,this is such a cute shirt with a lace back. its very very short and tight. i wish it fit. it would be great for winter.
2.0,"Hard to put on & take off. Not quite as ""compressing"" around the ankle area as I would have expected (& desired)."
2.0,It is not as delicate as it looks in the picture.
2.0,Cheap and thin material.
2.0,"I was dissatisfied with the time it took to receive-5 weeks. The shirts  are just ok. Nice colors and soft, but I felt made slightly out of proportion. I’ll keep them both as lightweight Yardwork sweatshirts."
2.0,"I love the look of the sandal but it's not meant to be.  I got my normal size 10 and they were too long.  So I returned and got a 9.5, those seem too narrow and still a little too long.  I also have to pull the velcro pretty far over to get a good fit and then it looks weird.  I don't know if the sizing is weird on these or if I need a wide width, maybe I just weird feet.  In any case, I give up.  It's really disappointing since these are so cute.  It's really hard to find cute, supportive sandals for PF. Maybe if I could find them in store and try different sizes/widths I could find the right fit.  But I feel bad buying and returning size after size."
2.0,"The print and style are so cute, but this is more of a cover-up than a dress - I don't consider my style overly conservative but it is very skimpy; as in, if you're not wearing shorts underneath, you will have a serious wardrobe malfunction.  the white is very sheer, and the slit goes pretty much all the way up to the waist and does not have enough overlapping to keep you well covered with normal movement like walking.  I wanted to wear this for my rehearsal dinner, but I will not be keeping this item."
2.0,This looks great BUT the sizing is WRONG it is suppose to be a 2X looks like a small or medium shirt.  It's not worth my time to send it back.  Don't dare to try again. To bad it is a cute shirt.
2.0,Long sleve was defective one was longer than the other.
2.0,So this hat is a good price but it’s cheap.  It’s all smashed up and the black accent ribbon is crooked and not attached fully.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Not for me. The model looks great wearing it so I figured I'd give it a shot, but the hat is super loose on top and looks horrible! I could not wear it out I the house. It is warm and looks like a good quality, but just a horrible fit."
2.0,Item did not look like picture
2.0,Constantly a tangled mess
2.0,Hurts to put in and way too bulky on my nose
2.0,My suspenders had a short in them. Had to wiggle and physically tape the box to my shirt at a certain angle in order to get anything to work.
2.0,This hat is not for an adult... this fits a small child. Only purchase if yoh have an extremely small head with extremely thin hair.
2.0,"Fit fine, just WAY WAY too SHORT!"
2.0,"Not the same as when I was a child, they were made far better."
2.0,WAY too big. Looks more like lingerie than a waist trainer.
2.0,Super uncomfortable and cheaply made. The leather feels like it's peeling off
2.0,very short in the torso area.  barely comes to the top of my jeans.
2.0,Actual size of logo is even smaller than that shown so is very hard to see Batman logo
2.0,It covers well but shapeless and ugly. Looks like a pillowcase.
2.0,"Actually returned, not a great fit at all."
2.0,"The product alone was beautiful in its own way. I was expecting it to be more or a cloth material. It was more of a silk type material, and it looks so great in the pictures, and when I got it. It seemed to be more of a bathing suit cover."
2.0,"These are just okay. I have long, thin hair. It slides back and off within half an hour. Blech.<br />UPDATE: just bought the Kingree brand for a fraction of the price. The grip on Kingree is WAY better."
2.0,Goggles glued on and came off in seconds.  Take a picture of this on your kid quick before it’s junked up
2.0,"This is pretty cheap looking.  It's an OK dress if you wear a lot of dresses but, it's just a stretchy tank top piece with a skirt attached directly below the boob area.  Kind of odd- and would probably look better if you're pretty skinny but otherwise, it just looks a bit like a pregnancy dress."
2.0,Cute shirt but way to small.  I usually wear an xl shirt and I ordered 3x and it was way to small
2.0,"Kind of cute but the size is weird. I ordered a large, I’m 5.5’ and 150lbs. It fits loose but the sleeves right at the elbow are way too tight."
2.0,"The writing and the photo of the dragon are too small, almost can’t make them out to know what it is."
2.0,"The stones are not like in the pictures, they are so tiny that you can not notice that they are there, and the names... pfff tiny too."
2.0,Is not as puffy as it shows on the picture the layers are very thin
2.0,Not as expected will keep was was disappointed in size and quality.
2.0,not what I expected... snags clothes
2.0,Good but i used two times and has a hole
2.0,"Returned. I am 5'6&#34;, 125lbs. The small was a bit loose, and the length was an inch or 2 shorter than I would have liked. Good quality. Comfortable. Just didn't work for me."
2.0,Very cute but arrived broken. They don’t look nicely made unfortunately so I didn’t opt for a replacement pair.
2.0,Cheap feel and look and too big
2.0,"This dress looked NOTHING like the picture and fit horribly. My body is very close to mannequin size and shape and still the dress was loose in the bust, uneven in the waist and unflattering through the hips. Save yourself the time and BUY A DIFFERENT DRESS."
2.0,"Cute, but ran very small. Sadly must return."
2.0,Look cheap and fit strange.
2.0,"I wear my watch on my left arm.  The button for power and emergency 911 calls is so big and so sensitive that if I put my hand on a table or bend my wrist up at all, it depresses the button even though I don't feel it.  In the first 3 hours I had the thing on I had to quickly cancel 911 calls 4 times.  For the price I'm not returning it, probably will try to shave the button a little to reduce sensitivity.  But this is an issue that those who wear on the left arm should know about."
2.0,The fit overall is a little tight. The lenses are a darker and less clear. I am giving this pair away now since I can't get a refund.
2.0,"The socks are very cute, however after the second wash they shrunk a lot and they look very old."
2.0,"Should of really thought this through before ordering, It runs extremely small, will fit someone the size of 0."
2.0,This skirt runs large and doesn’t fit and look like as pictured.
2.0,No complaints on the product. But seriously this is how it got delivered to my house in the clear see through bag.
2.0,Too small for a man's wrist. Sending this back for another option
2.0,These socks are too long
2.0,"I would not suggest this band.  It is poor quality and looked cheap.  Also it did not connect well with the clasp and it fell off twice within the first hour of wearing it. IF not careful, I would have lost my watch.  I've never worn it since."
2.0,Ordered a medium fit like a X-Large
2.0,the straps on this item are awkwardly placed and uncomfortably rub.
2.0,One size does not fit all.
2.0,It was ok.  If you wear a medium get an xl....this shirt runs very small
2.0,Runs a little small. The cork base is glittery. It doesn't show in the pictures but the glitter looks ugly
2.0,Very fragile!!!! 3 were broke upon arrival! Large pieces
2.0,"It was very cute and I loved it, but it broke within a few uses"
2.0,se ve bonito por fuera pero por dentro apenas y cabe una polvera y un labial
2.0,"These are very thin. I like the breathability, but not sure how protective they are in regards to Covid if you came in close contact with someone. They are very large, so they constantly fall off my narrow face. If you have a small head, I wouldn’t recommend them. They are more convenient than a mask...if only they stayed on better."
2.0,"They fit ok, but have 2 weird holes in the bottom of each shoe that allow dirt and water to get through. Not a fan of either. Gave them away because I didn’t like them."
2.0,"These are barely child sized, definitely not for adults!!! I ordered for my 16 year old with autism, & they do not expand like I expected them to. Put them on my 6 month old & they were so tight they squished her little cheeks all in & left marks on her head. They were so big and bulky she could hardly hold her head up so I’ll be ordering different ones. Unless ordering for a tiny baby these are not going to work most likely. It’s a shame bc they are cute"
2.0,"""Can't get them to close (snap) to keep them on."
2.0,"Well, not exactly the item described in the picture.  The color I received was not the dark maroon color as advertised on the blonde model.  The item I received was the color shown on the brunette model.  Also, the front of the shirt was shorter than expected.  There is no tag listing the care and materials of the sweater.  All in all disappointed."
2.0,"I knew I was rolling the dice--(2) pairs of bifocal sunglasses for > $16. Still, I've had just enough luck in the past to give it a shot. Sad to say, overall, these will be relegated to the 'back up drawer,' placed amongst the 'also rans.'<br /><br />PROS: Frames, armatures are adjustable, it's single, greatest feature.<br />Lens quality: barely fair<br /><br />CONS: General construction very creaky and wobbly. If even 2 more plastic molecules had been missing I think you would have had silly putty. Bifocal portions very distorted. I mean, pretty bad.<br /><br />If you are looking for some cheap glasses to throw in a tackle box, back of a drawer, etc., these are for you. They 'claim' to be safety glasses but I would not even consider trying to find out. I didn't return them because I knew what I was in for and they are just barely passable."
2.0,It was a bit difficult walking in this because there’s little to no stretch in there
2.0,Shirt is rough and completely  see through.
2.0,I don't know but looks like a copy and not original
2.0,"Description of the shirt of light and easy fitting.  The shirt I received first of all it not the color I chosen.  See picture enclosed of the shirt I received.  Secondly the material of the shirt seem cheap, not very flattering."
2.0,"Came as BRIGHT tomato red, not the deep wine as shown. Also, material is really thing and shows your bra. Pass."
2.0,I did not like the material it is made out if. Will probably snag easily.
2.0,"The sizing is accurate, the problem is that these are SUPER long. Like, unusually long for plugs. I had to send them back."
2.0,NOT TRUE TO FIT AT ALL!
2.0,Gave to my daughter.  Short and wide. Not completely white more off—white.
2.0,"Got the 5mm. Very nice, good price, but broke after a month of light wear."
2.0,The sleeves are tiny.  It's kind of petite overall.  I recommend to get it one or two sizes bigger than your actual size.
2.0,Very tight fitting. It’s not comfortable to wear at all and my wrist is very small
2.0,Really crappy materials. The metal part that goes in your ear is like a cheap brass thumbtack.
2.0,Love the T-shirt but it is sized very very small. I ordered two sizes larger so it would be long and it is still very tight. I take a large and ordered a 1X and it very small.
2.0,It was more like a fitted tank top than a flowing loose one as seen in the picture. The material it was made out of however was actually really nice and soft.
2.0,MAS O MENOS
2.0,very pretty and soft but NOT FOR LARGE PEOPLE!!
2.0,"Loved shrug but ordered dark brown received a light brown, also ordered 2 sizes bigger and fit was good. Probably will return because wrong color."
2.0,"Very limp, baggy, loose cheesy fabric, poor quality, easily bunched up, not worth the money."
2.0,Much shorter than I expected. On the model the top looks longer than in real life. Not too happy. Won’t purchase anymore.
2.0,Actually kind of cheesy - not really a sun blocker. I use them for running and I guess I had unreal expectations but it seems they spend more on packaging and promotion then investing in the product. I have had good experiences with lower priced sunglasses ($20 - $30) but this was not one. Your experience might be quite different but mine was disappointing.
2.0,"Poor quality, they ripped at the seams."
2.0,"Broke within the first couple of months, the metal piece that attaches it to the watch snapped. Too bad, because it was cute."
2.0,"Would not recommend, leaves black residue on your front and back cards that directly touch the plate. Also leaves scratches in the magnetic strip of credit/debit cards."
2.0,"This dress is a beautiful color and has a lot of weight! I was going to ignore all the loose threads that were on the dress when I received it. That was until I found a rip near the neckline. I’m so disappointed in the quality. I’m not going to bother returning it because I threw out the packaging, and who has time? It’s not worth my energy. Terrible quality overall. I really wanted to love this dress."
2.0,Not enough space to write name/address. Would return it if i could at this juncture.
2.0,too small. ima give it away to a skinner girl
2.0,"I bought as a set for a somewhat conservative wedding I was in. They are beautiful rings, but I couldn't wear them because I could never get the stone out. My husband and I tried multiple times, with various tools, to get the stone out without damaging the ring but we could never get it out. I will try again because I would love to wear them but we'll see."
2.0,Worked great the first day.  Then the second time I wore them I had to use pins to keep them from rolling.
2.0,This is not what I expected. A cutout iron-on a basic black shirt. I could have done this myself.
2.0,Fabric is not suitable for casual wear and has a rough cross weave/spandexy look. The top half is the gray legging compared to a normal VIV legging texture.
2.0,"Too small, very thin material, not worth the price."
2.0,Not flattering on me.  Very high waist.<br />well made
2.0,I did not like the material of the inside pouch.  And I assumed there would be a shoulder strap because of the hooks on each side.
2.0,Very thin! The back was transparent. The front was really short. Returned. It was cheaply made.
2.0,Very cute. But thin and too small. I had to return it.
2.0,"Mine came with partially undone seams around the top and is weirdly rough and scratchy around the edges, like they tried to fix it with glue but it didn't work so now I have to sew it back up and cut the hardened edges off."
2.0,Of course the return window expired yesterday.  I tried this today as a surprise for my grandsons and of course it did not blow up.  I had new batteries in it but the air blower was not strong enough to inflate it.  So disappointed.  I will try to return it but probably won't get anywhere with it.
2.0,"While this installed easily, they do not stay in place and floated away from the INSIDE of my swim mask. I was fortunate enough to be able to read my dive gauges without them, because these were gone within minutes after entering the water. I tried hard to hang onto them when rinsing my mask, but to no avail."
2.0,"These things should work, but they don't.<br /><br />When you have them installed correctly, you can see the metal behind the tie--unless your tie is REALLY close and tight against your neck.<br /><br />You have to buy the multi-pack, when only two or three would suffice."
2.0,"Size chart was wrong. Much smaller and shorter than expected. Decent quality. Fit my son, so not lost."
2.0,These are pretty and very warm but on one of the slipper socks the fleece inside separated and the fleece bunched up on the inside. The other sock was ok but for that reason I would not repurchase from this merchant. I definitely would try another because the socks are warm and the grips on the bottom worked well.
2.0,"This is absolutely not a compression top. It is simply a nice, soft tank top. I even ordered a size down to make sure it would be tight to suck me in but it is not even close to being a compression tank top. If you need a nice under shirt though..this is it"
2.0,"These were super cute and I love the idea, but my earlobes were THROBBING within about a couple hours of putting them on. Not only that but they were a bit swollen for about a day after I took them off. Not wearing them again. And no, I do not have abnormally fat earlobes."
2.0,Works but very thin mil rating on the glove.  Can tear easily.
2.0,Shows through clothes and the hole in the crotch actually ends up hurting your thighs throughout the day
2.0,Bulky. Returned.
2.0,"These work as advertised, IF YOU CAN GET THEM ON!!!  It takes a good minute and a half to get each sock on.  They are definitely not easy on!  Would not buy again."
2.0,My nose isn’t even that big put this is too small that the diamond will sink into my nose :/ it’s cute but the corkscrew isn’t long enough.
2.0,I dont like the fittings and the stiching style.<br />I wanted tj return a d want my money back but the seller never responded to my emails.
2.0,The elastic part is not long enough.
2.0,It's very pretty. Very heavy. The backing bends easy which means it's hard to keep on your ear without falling off.
2.0,Love this pullover! I do wish it was a little bit softer but runs true to size and looks great on.
2.0,I couldn’t really get it over my chest. Runs very small in that department. Would not recommend to larger chested women. Had to return it. Fits like a smaller junior size
2.0,runs small and cheaply made with strings falling out.
2.0,I do not like the fit. Did not lift as stated.
2.0,This is nice shirt but my size was 2 sizes too large.  Unfortunately I need to return it and get a smaller size.
2.0,"The material for the denim was fine. But the black and white literally felt like wearing plastic. Not breathable fabric. Material reminded me of the plastic material I put on my boyfriend's son's bet to protect the matress from wetting the bed.... Just thicker. They look as pictured; very cute. But they are a material that would cause discomfort, sweating, and- I would be willing to bet- a high likelihood of skin irritation or chaffing"
2.0,I would have loved this dress - I got a ton of compliments. But it ripped the first night I wore it out. Poorly made.
2.0,To tight in my arms
2.0,"I am so disappointed. I had purchased two Life is Good Crusher t-shirts for hubby in recent years.<br />They were excellent quality, fit and washed well, etc. so I wasn’t concerned about buying him another.<br />However, the first time I laundered this new Life is Good (Jake & Rocket Moon) t-shirt it became discolored.<br />Something happened to the shirt dye perhaps as it appears almost lightly faded/stained (both front and back) in places.<br />I, of course, washed it in cold water and dried on low heat as directed.<br />This experience was a great letdown as we love these t-shirts and were very happy with the 2 others. Bummer!"
2.0,This was NOT a slim shirt. Had to send it back. The return process was swift.
2.0,Falls apart easily. Not easily adjustable at all. Pieces lost quickly. Not as cool as appears in picture.
2.0,"Fit as expected,  but not seamless which is why I purchased them."
2.0,The product broke within less than a month.
2.0,way too short. had to buy lace to make longer does not fit as in picture
2.0,I don’t like the closure. I thought that it lit up in the dark
2.0,"These would be perfect if they were longer. These shirts lift up way too high and show off your stomach if you lift your arms up. No way this shirt will stay tucked in. I am normally a large but ordered both XL and L to see which fit better. The XL would be perfect if it weren't so dang short. I am 5'11"" 195lb"
2.0,There are a few black marks on a few of the circles on the top of the chain.
2.0,Wasn’t happy
2.0,After wearing these pants for a month or two the small rubbery (spandex?) white threads started to show up on the surface on the fabric . It is very difficult to get rid of them.
2.0,These pants were transparent and too small. I gave them to my thinner daughter.
2.0,Not comfortable and doesn’t look good either!!
2.0,This dress definitely runs small. I couldn't even get it on. The material is very scratchy though so I do not think I will be getting another in a larger size.
2.0,The tassel part does not lie straight as it should. It slides up and down so I spent my day adjusting it every few minutes. Very annoying. And the metal bit is not a bright gold but antiquey old looking
2.0,"The suite is very cute and provides lift in the breast, but it runs small in the tummy and bottoms. It didn't work for me too small."
2.0,Flimsy & didn’t come with the tiara!! :( Giving them two stars because at least they came on time
2.0,...really small ..... maybe would fit a 6 yr old girl ... not made for women
2.0,"This just won't stay in place. The Volvo is easy to work with, chin pad is comfortable but no matter where I put it or how I adjust the tightness, it just falls or slides and doesn't keep my mouth closed. Will not use this style again."
2.0,It is very small.  Don't waste your money
2.0,"Not true to size, quality isn't that great either"
2.0,"I was expecting to have a really good, high-quality pair of gloves when I bought these. It has a $60 price tag, so I assumed $60 quality gloves. Its more of a $20 pair. They are way too small despite ordering the largest 16 oz. Both of the thumb sockets are uncomfortable. At first, I thought it was just a desgin flaw, but the other pair I got were the same way. They are also extremely hard to get on and off. Many people say that you have to break in gloves before they become usable, but they shouldn't hurt your hands like these ones do. I used them for two weeks, and now I can't punch anymore because my knuckles and wrists hurt so badly. They look really cool though (which is why I bought them), but if you are looking for $60 quality gloves, there are way better gloves out there."
2.0,Not what I expected over priced.
2.0,Didn't fit any of the shoes I bought them for. Great concept though.
2.0,"Suppose to be a 3XL, might be lucky if they are a size XL.  Waste of money. Was to be a Christmas gift."
2.0,"Has a weird fit. But the most disappointing part was the color. When I received it I double checked to make sure it was the correct color. This dress is not burgundy, it is RED. Had to return."
2.0,"Although the dress was SO cute and comfortable it did not fit right. The part labeled ""waist"" in the sizing picture is actually the mid to upper rib cage and the band that is supposed to fit there sat right above my belly button. When I moved it to the proper location everything above the band area was too loose."
2.0,"Fit as expected, however it doesn't look at all as the one in the picture."
2.0,I did already have a similar one in pink ad hoped that this one would be as nice as the old one. But sadly the frame is bent and the colors do not match those on the fotos.
2.0,Really wish they were better quality. Super cute though.
2.0,"Love the way it fits. Since I'm 5'3, the option for getting it Short is amazing. But unfortunately, only having it for a month & its elastic strings are popping out along the seam of the pants. Not worth the money you spend."
2.0,"The shirt itself is nice. The colors are exactly as depicted. The material is a bit thin for a shirt, it's more the kind of material for a pajama top.<br /><br />I ordered a large hoping it would be okay since the person whom this shirt is intended for is an adult woman but it looks more like a kids medium. Not happy with the size at all which is why this is rated 2 stars. If you order, order big since it seems the sizes run small."
2.0,"Super cute but for super narrow faces, only."
2.0,Didn't fit. No return instructions.
2.0,very big. I ordered a 5 -6 because my daughter is bigger than most 3 year old she wears a 5 or 6 but this is very large I have to roll the sleeves 3 times I guess you get what you pay for
2.0,"Cheaply made, and very small.  They will be stretched out in no time."
2.0,"I always order medium button down shirts, and I did so here - and it was way too small.  Order up a size."
2.0,Product color NOT as described. (“Red” is actually a coral color)
2.0,Advertised as 55% Linen.  The tag on the shirt showed no Linen whatsoever.  Very thick and<br />heavy material.  Mostly Polyester.  Returned it.
2.0,"Not true to size,  I returned"
2.0,"Used when eating spaghetti.  Saves your clothes well. However, the tomato sauce stains the plastic!  This plastic is porous and cannot be effectively cleaned.  How stupid to make a bib out of porous plastic!"
2.0,"It was cheap, so I got a cheap product! The picture showed it very differently- the bottom had no poof to it, and it is super thin. I do like that the sequin material is stretchy, but it wouldn’t work for me."
2.0,"Product is too small of a fit both length and width, which makes it uncomfortable. Not a great material."
2.0,All of these rings broke after very little wear. Spend a little more money and go for better quality.
2.0,Very boxy. I am 5'3&#34; 125lbs. The top part was okay but there was way too much room on the bottom that made it look unflattering. Too bad because I was really excited about it.
2.0,"These lens are thinner than originals and move slightly once fitted into the frames.  Also I noticed distortion at the edges while wearing them and some odd polarization visions.  Like all windshields have a blue glare while wearing these?  Also the rose tint took some getting used to.  After having these lens for a couple days, I went out and bought a new pair of sunglasses!  I did however find these very useful on overcast days or driving in shadier areas.  These lenses made my premium sunglasses into a pair of cheap sunglasses."
2.0,They were comfortable when you first put them on but then in a couple of hours they rip between the fingers
2.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07146X6HW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11
2.0,but I am not impressed with the quality. It is a pretty bracelet but very uncomfortable to wear. The quality seems very cheap and the bracelet pulls at the hairs in your skin. Wore it for about 5 mins and had to take it off it was just bothersome.
2.0,It was not the color  I expected I asked for white it was more cream n color and it fit to snug I'm typically a loose Xl. But it was like putting on a medium
2.0,"It was to chunky for me, reminded me of a fortune cookie. Not my style"
2.0,Cute but they came apart.
2.0,I returned this as it was like a big bag.
2.0,"I bought this winder because it was affordable (but nowhere near cheap at several hundred dollars).  It arrived today and the wood finish is immaculate.  This thing looks like a nice piece of furniture - on the outside.  The construction is a little shoddy though.  The left door isn't hung straight and the drawer won't open because the cheap fabric lining binds the drawer.  The rotations are pre-set but one of the four winders moves at half the speed of the other three.  Lastly, the winders themselves pop out of the back of the box because they are just stuck in with friction.<br />Overall, it looks nice but the construction is definitely not top notch."
2.0,"Much shorter and boxy in person. It doesn't flow well, and is almost so cheap looking that it is unwearable (almost)."
2.0,"Overall, it fit nicely, I am 5 ft 7, 190 lbs. The back was very loose and droopy, I'm not sure, but it almost look torn. I returned it."
2.0,too small...have to return
2.0,"Did not like the color, nor the quality."
2.0,The fit was fine but the material is so thin I don't feel comfortable wearing it in public
2.0,Would be a nice shirt except for the big discoloration on the back. It looks like an oil stain that I wont be able to get it out.
2.0,The pearls kept falling off
2.0,"I didn't realize the background was white cardboard.  Will you talented jewelry designers please design an atheist necklace that is smaller and daintier for women?  Most of them are 1&#34; or more diameter, and I'm not Mr. T., don't care for the big chains."
2.0,I was sent the wrong size but it ended up only being a little too big Runs VERY SMALL
2.0,Pretty purse.... but my note 4 phn doesn't fit  on it...
2.0,"I loved the color of this dress, however I returned it. The picture does not show it very well the cold shoulder part has a ruffle all the way around and it easily gets flipped over and is not flattering. If it did not have that ruffle, I would have kept the dress."
2.0,"I normally wear an XL it is stated that sizes are true to size. I ordered the XL but was very tight fit. So I  returned & ordered the next size up, an XXL, but was still way too small.  Very disappointed because the shirt was amazing."
2.0,I don’t like that much
2.0,Cute BUT the red runs onto the white and I washed it in cold water
2.0,They’re painted and the paint came off in three days of wearing them! Too pricey for cheap flips flops
2.0,"I bought this necklace as a gift and once I received it, decided not to give it because it looked so cheap. This is not worth the money, the stone is cheap looking and the chain is a very fake gold color."
2.0,New and washed. Shrunk about two sizes. Too small in the end.
2.0,While inexpensive the quality is very poor.  The fabric is a heavy polyester and the seams down the size are uneven leaving the fabric puckered
2.0,"They are way to tight around the crotch aura, feels like they can rip at any moment."
2.0,Unfortunately the hat is somewhat small .  Suggest enlarge hat size by an inch .
2.0,Very thin and sheer. Too oversized for my recommended size - medium and the fabric felt scratchy to me.
2.0,This would probably fit…like everything else in the world that’s tailored to slender people. I immediately felt terrible about myself after putting this on. Couldn’t get rid of it fast enough.
2.0,Please know this is very cheaply made. The feathers came messed up. You can see the cardboard and some of card board was ripped so you can see the brown clear as day. This will only be able to be worn once !!!
2.0,"Sizing is kind of off, this was too small and I normally wear a XL.  Also be warned this is very very see through."
2.0,Bought this for my daughter. Thought I could change the letter to an M but it still came with an A on it.
2.0,It’s a cute outfit but it ran so small ordered it like 3x’s and still didn’t fit around my 5 month old
2.0,"I loved it when I first got it.  I gave it as a gift for Christmas and yesterday (1/12/14) the buckle broke.  It's not fixable either.  Won't buy another. For the money I paid for it, it should be replaced free of charge but I'm not sure I want to bother with another."
2.0,My wife wore them Ince and they fell apart
2.0,"The sleeves are really big. My wife did not like it on me, so I gave it to goodwill."
2.0,Hurt to have them on .
2.0,"While these are both nice looking, they broke within a couple times of using.  As you can see from the picture I gathered the beads... I’m trying to decide if I want to go to the trouble of purchasing a stronger string and remaking them myself!"
2.0,"Very pretty, but halfway through dinner it broke.....embarrassing...."
2.0,I bought them to keep me warm in the desert and we’ll they go about 3 inches above my ankle so not flattering nor gonna keep me warm. If they were longer they would be much better. other than that made well and fuzz is soft on the inside
2.0,The order was for 3 lanyards. Only received 2.<br />When will I receive the 3rd one?
2.0,I generally wear small but this just didn’t fit :(
2.0,"The sunglasses are shaped differently in real life. Maybe I ordered the ones that were too big?<br />Might as well buy them off of the people selling cheap sunglasses downtown and in the malls though, at least then you can seem them in person."
2.0,"The jean material is stretchy and smooths out any lumps. The problem is the spaces between the buttons, they leave a large opening between them that shows skin. I need to have a tailor sew it up somehow. The back of the dress is a little loose. I’m 5.5, weigh 170, and ordered a large. The dress is stretchy and meant to fit tight so ordering up a size wouldn’t help. Even worse is the smell. It reeks of mothballs. Enough to make you gag. I left the dress out hoping that the stench would subside. 6 days later and it’s still there. I’m contemplating if I should pay a tailor to sew it and wash it to get rid of the stench, or just return it."
2.0,"Good price for a set of 4 pairs, and the size range is pretty good. However, one of the latches didn't work, and for some odd reason, they were very hard to put through my ear piercings. I normally don't have any issues with any of my earrings, so I found this odd. The posts aren't unusually thick either so I don't understand. By the time I forced them through, my ears were so sore, and they continued to irritate my ears as I wore them. I don't want to have to struggle to put them on every time. Plus, being stainless steel, they are a dark silver. I prefer the brightness of sterling silver, so I'm going to look for something else."
2.0,"Black band fit watch well. Colorful band is just a bit  too wide and will not fit the watch. Disappointed, it has a cool look and would go well with the colorful, health watchface."
2.0,"I ordered a Large (I am 5'7, 135lbs, Size B).  This would fit a 6 year old."
2.0,The quality is good but it come way smaller than you expect. I can not use mine so i have to gift it to some else. I ordered small but its like xxs.
2.0,size chart does not accurately reflect sizing.
2.0,"Cute shirt, at first. The sleeves shrunk a lot after one washing. Cold water.  And, the stitching became tattered in the front. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"Only after wearing these for maybe 6 weeks on/off, the right slipper is already coming apart at the seam.  Return window closed after a month so, unable to return. These should last longer than 6 weeks!"
2.0,"I own other dresses from this brand and have been pleased with them overall. They’re great for work. That said, this dress runs large and long. It is also a satin like material that looks and feels cheap."
2.0,The blue in the stripes and the blue in the skirt are two different shades. Maybe I'm just OCD but it really bothers me.
2.0,PURE CHEAP T-SHIRT GARBAGE
2.0,"Were fine until I tried to take them out the day after I put them in. Both would not unscrew, acted like they were super glued on. My girlfriend had to use pliers to get them off."
2.0,Cute dress. Definitely runs small. I'd size up one or two sizes. Be careful with how you wash it. I washed mine on cold in the washer and it hung it to try and it shrunk so much that I wasn't able to wear it. Had to give it to my 13 year old niece. Too bad because I did really like it before it shrunk.
2.0,"These shorts felt like decent quality, but they run much larger than traditional US mens. They were so baggy, it would be hard to use them for athletic purposes."
2.0,The picture and what I received are two different items.Not to happy with it
2.0,"did not like the way they looked on my shoes....  returned them and for as small as the package is, got charged a restocking fee...  pathetic"
2.0,It looks great on the picture. .. but what I received was more like plastic...
2.0,Plastic. Why would you ever make a plastic one
2.0,"Product shrinks heavily, way too short."
2.0,"Just yuck. The material is rough, it doesn’t cover the belly. If you have a FUPA don’t order!"
2.0,normally wear a size 8 jean fit chart directed me to a medium.....have to send back
2.0,"Ordered XXL, fit like a large. It was absolutely not sized right."
2.0,they don't work as i expected. I still get the headlight glare.
2.0,Runs small. Not comfortable.
2.0,The reason for a bad review isn't the company's fault. I just found it so difficult to close these once they're in. I still haven't managed to wear them because of it.
2.0,Shirt is to short
2.0,"You would think if the description says ""loose"" it'd at least fit.<br />It's way too small, not loose at all!"
2.0,"I’m not sure if this was a used/returned item that was altered from the pervious customer, but it was very poor quality."
2.0,"Perhaps should've paid a bit more attention to the description but the shoes were quite a bit smaller than I assumed for the size I ordered (size 12). My daughter couldn't get them on with/without tights on so I returned. She normally wears a size 11 so I ordered larger just so she could wear them a little longer and they were still too small. They were cute and she loved them so if I can find luck with a size bigger, I might purchase again."
2.0,"The skirt material is unexpectedly heavy, stiff, and is easily wrinkled.  The skirt does not fall nicely, but instead it juts out at awkward angles and does not look flattering in any way."
2.0,"These were supposed to be for my 7 and 12 year old's. However, they were FAR too small for my 12 yo and barely fit around my 7yo's eyes (basically, she refused to go without and forced them to 'fit')<br /><br />My 4 year old wore one pair most of the time with great success and they would have fit my 5 year old but, I certainly wouldn't recommend them for anyone over 5!<br /><br />The quality is severely lacking as well, as water frequently leaked in, despite getting a good initial fit.<br />I definitely would not buy them again, especially at $14 for two pair. You can find much better quality at a far cheaper price in local stores!"
2.0,Very tall boot and too tight on the top. Can hardly fit any pants under.  Very hot after 5 min wearing. No air. Feet sweat crazy.<br />Just for looks may be short trip. Not what I bought it for - family outing in bad weather
2.0,"Awful! Huge! Cheap! Poorly made. See Through! Pattern on both sides of leggings completly didn't line up. Find another product, these are junk. I bought others I loved. Two stars and one of them is for the seller who shipped fast."
2.0,I liked the sweatshirt but it was WAY to small. It fit my 9 year old. I chose a size SM since I usually wear that size. I should have went with a MD or LG. Not the best quality but it would have been a cute light sweatshirt.
2.0,"I like the necklace, but was very disappointed that the chain broke.  I gave it to my Granddaughter and less than a week later the chain had broken."
2.0,"So small, they are hard to handle. Not what expected."
2.0,SHRANK INTO A RAG AFTER ONE WASHING.  BUY PRESHRUNK.
2.0,I like it but not fit
2.0,Somewhat disappointed mine was primarily bluish green. Had hope d for more color variance.
2.0,Cheap see through
2.0,On three of the masks the middle was sewed with the saying being messed up. I bought these for a family picture and now can't use three if them. I did give 2 stars because I can still use the other three.
2.0,Great wood and metal combine however way to small
2.0,I brought the smallest band but its too loose the watch doesn’t stay in place it just slides around.
2.0,No instruction on how to attach the bangs
2.0,Looks nice and fits OK but it faded in the pool right away.<br />It is now more lavendar.
2.0,"I tried to like this, I really did.  But the more I used this bag, the less I liked it.  Unbelievably stiff and heavy.  The handles are too short to slip over my shoulder, and the cross body strap can't be used well as a shoulder strap without going to a shoe repair shop to have additional holes punched.  The leather look is a veneer - if you scratch it, the other layers will show.  All in all, a serious disappointment."
2.0,"Yesterday I bought this charm at a local shop for my daughter. My daughter noticed that the crystal had fallen out within 5-10 minutes of gentle indoor play. It's tiny and we haven't found it anywhere. My daughter is disappointed, to say the least. These charms (by Charm It! are very cute, and reasonably priced at five to six dollars. I know better than to expect top quality at those prices, but I still think this is pretty bad. The charm is still cute, but now my daughter is pestering me to take her to a craft store to buy more crystals so we can fix it, and have extra crystals on hand to fix it when it inevitably loses the crystal again. Something so simple should not be such a hassle.<br /><br />Yesterday was our first Charm It! purchase. We also bought a cute pink elephant charm that doesn't have crystals, and that one is fine. This tells me that I should probably avoid buying any Charm It! charm with crystals.<br />Despite this one bad experience, I can't recommend against the brand completely--their designs have loads of kid appeal and they are priced so low that even if your kid loses one, it's not a big financial loss. That makes this a perfect starter charm brand."
2.0,"I'm 5'2 135lbs bought the medium and the torso area of romper is way long, the elastic part for your wait goes to mid thigh, so to wear it how intended the pants  are short almost Capri length, then a bunch of loose fabric in waist area"
2.0,"I'm 5'4, size 12 and a 36DDD. This suit is beautiful and the material was good quality. The reason for the two stars is that I purchased a 4XL per the sizing chart given and none of it fit. The bottoms were slightly larger than expected and the top was extremely small for me. The fit of the top was more like a small D cup, (not knocking small D cups, believe me, I'd gladly give up these triple D's for a smaller cup size.) I was very disappointed because the suit is beautiful and so far out of my comfort zone but after losing 60lbs, felt I was ready to feel sexy again in a swimsuit."
2.0,"“ Fabric Type 94% Cotton, 6% Spandex” The gown had a terrible odor when I opened the package?  I seriously doubt that the gown is 96% cotton? Or if it has any cotton at all?  Amazon should be aware that this seller is making false claims about its product."
2.0,i was going to give the glasses  to my granddaughter.  they were just to small.  i did not give them to her.<br /> amazon was very good about them.  said i could return them or keep them a no charge.  maryann
2.0,So I was very under whelmed with this hat. It is smaller than it looked both in rim size and the cap size. Had several places where the stitching was coming undone. Really not expressed with the overall hat.
2.0,"It’s long, but in the sun it’s see through, especially around the chest area. People will see your bra."
2.0,"VERY SMALL, CHEAPLY MADE OUT OF POT METAL. Would not buy it again at all. Hollow, photo makes it look solid. Deceitful in presentation. Amazon should do a better job of making sellers better describe their products."
2.0,"Instead of the straps both pulling from the inner foot to the outer, they go opposite directions. Just seriously odd and seems like a design flaw.  The kid has kicked open the toe strap multiple times while running."
2.0,There was a stain on the lower half of the shirt! Its darker then the shirt.
2.0,Disappointment in quality
2.0,Pretty necklace but gold tarnished with 2 wearings. Very disappointeds
2.0,Bought for my daughter and followed size guidelines. They are tight and I can see through them and see her underwear. Will be returning
2.0,"Poor fit,  too short and waist too gigh.  I got a xl, it was Not knee length.  Too short for work."
2.0,"Loved the look, but fabric snagged just trying it on"
2.0,Doesn’t look anything like the picture looks like a really long tee shirt minus what I thought was a bow at the bottoms but I guess that’s how she’s holding it up
2.0,Not what I ordered<br />This is what I received 🙈
2.0,Top to little and pants to big
2.0,Horrible! See through and 5 times too big!
2.0,The color doesnt match the picture. It's more of an evergreen.
2.0,Cool design but the silicone stretch out and end up falling out of fingers
2.0,"I purchased this to wear around the house. Had I purchased it to wear out, I would be returning it. The fit is small. the fabric is somewhat sheer and is more like you would find in a nightie, not a dress. I thought it would be thicker than it is. Best thing I can say is it arrived much sooner than expected, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
2.0,If you are Large get an x-large.
2.0,returned to big
2.0,Runs extremely small. The Extra Large Plus (5x on the tag) fits like a Men's slim fit size Large. Material and build quality seem OK. If you have an athletic or heavy body type I would suggest going up 2 full sizes. Unfortunately for me those sizes don't exist.
2.0,"Draws attention to the belly.. Skirt is short, will not cover butt if that's what you're wanting. I'm 5'3 and 155 lbs and ordered the 46..not too tight by any means."
2.0,The elastic around the waste is so tight. I had to give to my daughter to wear because I didn’t try it on during the return window timeframe.
2.0,They broke the second time I wore them. Super cute though.
2.0,very light yarn not like the others bought at SK-Hat-shop
2.0,Had to return way too big
2.0,Not pleased with the quality and the straps
2.0,what I received was not what is advertised I kept the item because I did not want to go through the trouble of sending it back
2.0,Beware on this.  The black straps cover parts of the wording........so for example mine says through Chris instead of Christ.
2.0,average good
2.0,"These leggings fit ok, but they have a band at the bottom of the leg that is too tight. I bought the large and they fit overall, but the tight band is unbearable. I don’t recommend this product."
2.0,"Unfortunately this ring is not really what is pictured.  The band isn't solid, it's 2 thin bands, reminds me of gumball machine jewelry.  Also the silver was very tarnished.  The stone is fine.  I will be returning this."
2.0,"Bought this for traveling, and it's not as roomy as I thought.  There is a tote, a purse and a small flat clutch.  The clutch is great for storing your passport and credit cards.  The purse hooks inside the tote, so you can take them both with, then fill up the tote with treasures you find along the way and use the purse on your shoulder.  But, neither are very roomy, and my purse isn't as shown.  It doesn't have as much width as the picture, so can't fit too much in there.  The problem with the tote is the zipper along the top.  The zipper stops a few inches from the end of the bag, so it's awkward getting larger items in and out."
2.0,"These shorts are okay for the price. But less than a month after receiving them, the button popped off. Would suggest looking for another pair, won't be buying from this seller again"
2.0,"They look very cheaply made and they fit weird too. Took about a month to get to me as well, wouldn't buy again"
2.0,The pocket is saggy... the print of the cat is not in good quality.
2.0,Add is very misleading. Thought I was going to be getting 5 different colored wrist bands and only recieved one. Very disappointed
2.0,"It's a good thing that I purchased this vest for a Halloween costume. If I was going to be using this for real, everday wear it would be returned. It is costume quality."
2.0,"beautiful but doesn't fit at all, could not wear"
2.0,I didn't care for the clingy material...very revealing.  I also didn't realize it was shipped from London.  It cost me $12 in postage to return it.
2.0,"I'm returning this (ordered in ""navy"") because the top portion that is white with stripes is extremely sheer.  You can see a bra through it.  Otherwise, it's really cute but I'd rather not have a see through dress or wear a cami under this dress."
2.0,I can see the pockets through these.  I will be returning them.
2.0,"The product started tearing near the bottom after the first few days of traveling, other than the stitch quality I had no real problems with this pack."
2.0,"Material so thin you can see through it,, runs very small ,I wear a med to large,bought a xxl, just fit. Didn't pay much and I'm glad as it isn't worth much!!"
2.0,The material is cheap and stretchy fits short in the front and nothing about it is flattering.
2.0,It looked like a nicer garment on the Amazon site that does in person.It also sheds.It looks very cheap
2.0,"So it's simply BEAUTIFUL I'm 24 5'4&#34; medium size build, usually wear M-L in women's, XL in junior's. It fit wonderfully, only after a few minutes of wearing, that gorgeous design unraveled. It did so in a devastating way, half of the top completely lost the bead work. I didn't snag it, I merely put it on and it disintegrated :( I'm pretty sure it arrived with a snag that started the unravelling. So I'd say buy at your own risk. For a one size fits all it was surprisingly well fitting! And there's definitely room to spare, the arms are slightly shear, I wanted it for a classy evening, paired with a maroon evening gown and it matched quite well. It also sparkles in a subtle way. I was able to return it so they did offer good customer service. I wish i could rate it higher, but i wasn't really able to really wear it. :(<br />I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if i could."
2.0,"The hour hand never was accurate. It would reach the hour, 15-20 minutes before the minute hand reached 12 o'clock position.  Other than that, I like the watch and design."
2.0,"I didn't like these,because of fit. They should say,L,fits like 8to 10 size,womens. Liked the style,but if you can't wear them. It really doesn't matter. Waste of money."
2.0,"Loved how it looked the first two times I  wore it, but after only two washings it looks like an old sweater! I like how it’s supposed to look, but I wouldn’t have bought it if I knew what I know now. I have no interest in spending money on something to feel good in it two or three times!"
2.0,"Better than nothing when it started raining on our Disney trip, but bought other ones from Disney that fit better and were more comfortable."
2.0,"Nice color and quality. Unfortunately it is very different from the picture and description. Very short, will fit only my dog, sorry...  By the way, I'm petite, 5'1&#34;, my regular size S(4-6). And it is too small and short even for me! The sleeves too short, the whole thing is 2&#34; above my waist line!!! Also - it's not oversized like pictured on me... And I'm a small woman! WOW! Maybe it will be good for 8 - 10 years old girl?  Had to return it. Here is another good thing - the return is pretty easy."
2.0,"I usually read the reviews but unfortunately I really liked this bracelet so much that I didn't read the reviews on this one.  Big mistake.  There is no way this bracelet could fit a regular sized wrist, but it doesn't state anyplace that this is for a child.  I love the bracelet but it just doesn't fit an adult."
2.0,"I was so excited to get these sandals, I've heard they are so popular ! I think the material was too cheap for a sandals that cost over $100. The front strap didn't feel stretchy so I decided not to risk it and returned them.<br />I was disappointed. So I wanted to give my feedback as well. Unfortunately, they don't fit everyone that great :("
2.0,"Not what I expected, very tight and not stretchy at all."
2.0,Did not fit my glasses although description said they would.
2.0,Was very excited to get these but they are just too small!
2.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter's Saturday dancing classes, while it is not really the best purchase I made so far. The dress does fit as expected, so I think it is true to size, however, the material is not super nice. The tutu dress is in some kind of hard materials which made my daughter feel very uncomfortable in it. The tutu dress part scratch her arms when she tried on, we have to return it."
2.0,Not even the right shirt! I ordered the white paisley one and received a black rose
2.0,was to small and also the front was shorter than shown.  It was short enough to leave skin exposed between natural waist pants and the shirt.
2.0,The dress was a little short and I am 5’1”. The busy was tight and uncomfortable.
2.0,"Thie necklace broke. I have Not received a replacement product<br />d a reiplacement cement product<br /><br />The necklace was broken,I requested a replacement for the necklace. I have not received iany replacement<br />Ti ihank you"
2.0,Started to rip and tear after a few wears but still works for now.
2.0,"The item appears IT IS NOT NEW. No price tags and was not folder in the wrapping, instead in a ball stuffed in."
2.0,Sizing all weong
2.0,Nice material but they gather at the crotch when walking a lot - especially if sweating.
2.0,Not quite the look I was going for.  Not me
2.0,This item is very nice except for the fact that is is described as an anklet and it will not fit over my average size foot ( shoe size 7). It is too small for the purpose it was purchased. My daughter is wearing it as a bracelet and loves it.
2.0,"I was excited to get these socks, they look great and feel great, but they rip like nylon socks, I believe I wore a pair twice before I got a whole in the toe. I've had other socks that I wear constantly and never had this problem, but these seem like 2-3 wears and theyre already torn."
2.0,don't care for the fit nor quality
2.0,Soft and comfortable but I wanted to wear for bed and they shed all over the place even on rugs.
2.0,I was disappointed that one set of covers was missing.  These were intended to be a gift for colleagues.
2.0,Material is super thin.  Defeated the whole purpose of wearing something comfortable
2.0,This white shoe is at least a size larger than a blue medium size ordered from another vendor.  Have had to return this one.
2.0,This dress has a very visible seam at the waist line.  So it looks like a skirt and top.  It’s not nearly as flattering on as it is online.
2.0,This bag is cute and durable but the inside pouch on top does not have a zipper so all the items fall out. Now I just use the bag for make up brushes because make up on the floor is a pain in the butt. Needs a zipper!!!
2.0,"2.5 stars (couldn’t bring myself to round up!)<br />I got this to replace one I had that was exactly what I wanted but was accidentally thrown out 😢. The pendant itself is beautiful, but tiny. The picture is misleading, especially the pendant’s size relative to the chain. Either they used a teeny chain in the pics, or a bigger pendant. It’s much smaller than it appears in those pics. I didn’t measure to see if it matches the seller’s specs, but it looks more nearly equal in height and width than the seller says."
2.0,"It's not all they say it doe's , not stopping  glare at night , and that is what hurt my eyes to see well."
2.0,"Almost all the pieces are warped in some way. You can't see it but when I put the glass cabochon on, it doesn't set evenly, which makes it impossible to get them glued in securely."
2.0,"I bought this pajama a few days ago but it turned out to be a very warm fabric for the country I live in, and a bit big for the small size I ordered. the design is very cute."
2.0,But is a lot smaller than expected
2.0,The gold chain is very thin and frail. You can see in the picture how it compares to the rim of my nail. The 7.5 mm pearl is very small. I need a magnifying glass to see the diamond. This will actually turn out to be more expensive than I expected because I will need to purchase another gold chain or else I might end up losing the pendant when I accidentally rip the chain.
2.0,"The bust measurement for the adult large was 7 inches off, making the shirt fit a lot more awkwardly than expected. The shoulders and length are correct.<br />The actual product has a very very small amount of material at the bust and even less at the waist. There’s also just a top button so it gives the appearance of a cape kind of rather than a shirt."
2.0,They fell apart.
2.0,"I received this dress and I was so excited until I put it on. It is very bulky in the hip area and it gathers right below your boobs , not at the waist - I am not busty at all. I returned it"
2.0,Cheap! I won't buy this again.
2.0,The straps that fasten the pack closed are fake and held on by magnetic little buttons. Absolutely absurd. Looks gorgeous though. Durable too thus far if you don’t mind losing everything.
2.0,Lenses are decent but side rubber pieces rip in half when trying to put on the frames.
2.0,"These are cute, but the leather doesn't come far enough up and these shoes slip off easily.  Also, after the first wear, the heel is complete damaged.  The color on the heel just peeled off  like paper :(  Disappointing at best."
2.0,I wear a size nine and these are huge on me! You cannot walk around with these on. They are great to heat and relax on the couch. They don't stay warm as long as I would like but the first moments of warmth are great. I also thought they would be purple (I guess the lavender in the description confused me). Overall I'm disappointed. Expected purple slippers with a lavender scent that would be snug on my cold toes.
2.0,made well but not for me. I ordered this for the Kentucky derby but  I felt like I was boarding the mayflower in it. sent it back.
2.0,I received this item with both underwires already sticking out of the bikini top. Super cute but I will be returning. The quality was pretty good otherwise. Runs small.
2.0,Breathing valve is covered not sure how it works. Small fit; not good for adults maybe kids.  The filters are great.
2.0,barely big enough for a toddler.....
2.0,"i ordered these expecting to be as in the picture , they came and are solid black not the rustic gray as  they appear , i am not very happy because i was shopping for grey boots not black"
2.0,"The glasses fit side to side well and do not slip down. HOWEVER<br />The problem is adjusting them up or down so that the dividing line  in the lense is lower.<br />I need the magnifying portion(the lower ) to be lower.<br />I have attempted to adjust them and have had little luck, Perhaps some instructions would help/<br />ON MY LAST ATTEMPT TO ADJUST THE FRAMES BROKE!! rendering the glasses useless.<br /><br />Before this happened, I have received a reorder, hoping that they would fit better. NO Luck! I returned them after trying them on one time."
2.0,"I wanted so badly to love this, but the quality is just not that great.  I am 120 lbs, and usually wear a 32DD.  The Large is way too small, and the X-Large is way too large. It might work for a Halloween costume, but not for a romatic evening."
2.0,Smaller than I would  like.  They're ok
2.0,Much to large more like xxl
2.0,The sleeves dont look like the picture. It is over all small.
2.0,"My daughter bought these to use as nose rings and they are DEFINITELY not. Way too big and bulky and push very far out. Her and her brother use them as earrings which they do work for. The downside to that, is that the magnet doesn't hold too long and they eventually fall off resulting in lost jewelry"
2.0,didn't fit my chest.
2.0,I should have seen that the flip part of the glove did not cover the exposed thumb but i didn't.  Warmth is out the window because your thumb will get frost bite.  I personally won't buy this product again unless they expand the flip to also cover the thumb.
2.0,These are very heavy in your ears. I wear a zero and could feel these all day long. They're also very uncomfortable to sleep in. The back ring to secure them is very difficult to line up and screw on. I also have trouble getting the back ring back off as it gets stuck and jammed easily. The front of the gauges also has a cloudy white coating that makes them look scratched up.
2.0,wasn't made the same as picture the string is much smaller the color was off
2.0,"I bought this suit for my first ve year old daughter and bought according to the recommended size for her height and weight. The fit of this suit was very strange. It was much too wide and not tall enough. I have the skill to alter it, so that's what I did. without my adjustments it would have been unwearable."
2.0,I love the bathing suit it's beautiful! However it's super small I ordered a xlarge I'm usually a large but this is way too small!
2.0,"I have small wrists and it is too small for me, certainly not a mans bracelet, maybe it was for a woman and I made a mistake"
2.0,Not what I expected. The fabric is very thin polyester and the fit across the chest is funky. No pockets.
2.0,"Whether you like these or not will depend on the cut you’re looking for. I found the waist to fit spot on but the hips were really baggy, it would have been fine but then the legs are tapered again so it gives a saggy bubble butt look. If you’re looking for something loose and airy on the hips and fitted around the thighs then look no further. If not these won’t be for you. I also have a more athletic build, so if you have wider hips this may be perfect."
2.0,Iron on letters that peel up
2.0,"wanted this to be more like a ladies slip, but it is a dress."
2.0,"Hugs the corners of my temples even when the strap is completely undone.  I think its the bill; it should either be softer near the back or a little shorter.<br /><br />Wouldn't be that big of a deal, its just uncomfortable to wear for more than a couple minutes at a time."
2.0,Bad quality of the material and the white buttons are pretty off
2.0,"To small! I have sent it back to original sender and trying to get a refund per e-mails with same. I sent it by USPS back on June 20, 2016. I would like a full refund per!!"
2.0,"I love this idea and was excited to receive it. Very disappointed, this is huge, can't even make out what it is. Also color is very orange and beige. I expected nice red, white, and blue. The stock photo is misleading. Sending back."
2.0,I bought 2 of them in different plus sizes. Not a good fit for my plus size frame. It's light weight just It's way to see through to wear by its self. Returned both without any issues.
2.0,My son was very disappointed. Not normal sizes
2.0,Look the cuteness of them but You wash them once on delicate and let them air dry and they immediately look old afterwards.<br />🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
2.0,The design is great! The fit was perfect! The material was a little too thin to workout in and the first time i put them on the cute pocket seam unravelled so i have to find a way to sew it back together without ripping more of the pants.
2.0,"Bought this in black and the burgundy. The black has done great so far, lots of compliments but have not been able to use the burgundy because on the first use the latch came off so the purse can’t  close. Haven’t used it since."
2.0,"I liked the overall fit, especially the high waist, and look but there is no elastic around the leg holes so they don't sit still and are constantly giving you and uncomfortable wedgie."
2.0,Cute and soft but gave 2 stars because they don’t match😂 it was a funny Xmas present I guess haha
2.0,Read reviews and decided to go with a medium being I seen where some said it was a bit loose. Nope. Not loose at all! Skin tight and short.
2.0,Cute dress for the price but it fit insanely too small.  We purchased for 11 year old daughter and ended up handing it down to my 4 year old niece who it fit perfectly! Hmmmm...odd! Not sure if it was a a fluke mistagged item but definitely needs to be addressed for quality control
2.0,I can barely see through them
2.0,"I have to say I'm rather disappointed with this hat. The fur on it was shedding like a dog after winter. The entire thing just wasn't holding together well and that's a shame because I wanted to give this to my niece. As it stands now, the hat was worn once by me and even then it just didn't feel right.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review."
2.0,"Not the worst dress I've ordered but not great or even good. The size was fairly true to the chart except in the arm holes, they seemed smaller. The fabric was nice, I wanted to like the dress.<br />I'm 5'5&#34; and I found the dress to be long. The petticoat I purchased was not poofy at all so it may not have been to long with a proper petticoat."
2.0,"Pilled immediately, unsightly after 1 wearing. Then they shrank. Not best pleased."
2.0,The padding is too high up on the buttocks rather than where it needs to be on the sit bones.
2.0,Not that large!
2.0,I received these and over half of them don't work and others just flicker and die.  I know they are cheap but this is silly.
2.0,"Lovely as this bag is to look at, it is not designed for comfort.  It is extremely heavy empty and with the wallet and maybe an iPad inside it is exhausting. Would not get it again but it is very attractive as shown."
2.0,Made and ships from China. CZ knock off inferior silk screen and delivery took a long time.
2.0,I brought it for my 6 years old son and it fit well. But the quality of the vest was not good. Threads were coming out from some part of it.
2.0,The item was missing the spacer in the forheads area. This made tge mask uncomfotable and unreasonable
2.0,Had this sent to daughter at college. Zipper on hood broke so she has to get it to Amazon returns nearby. Shipped a replacement but concerned with quality.
2.0,I wasn't expecting a shirt full of stickers. Not one are embroidered...
2.0,The chain in cheap and immediate broke.  Would not recommend this item.
2.0,"Please note that this dress is not at all like the one worn by the model in the pictures.  It has an empire waist and is not at all flattering on any person who is not super thin.  The acid blue color is gorgeous, but the dress you get is not what is advertised.  Why won't manufacturers make dresses that sit at one's natural waist???"
2.0,"I had another “leather “  Bayite band that was lovely, fit well and was definitely leather. I don’t believe this band is real leather - it feels like rubber. I have trouble wearing rubber and silicone products (hives!) and this band causes me to have hives if tightened where it should be on my wrist."
2.0,"I was searching for glass plugs in the search bar and this was apparently very misleading with the description. I assumed the outer flare was acrylic but the rest was glass. On top of it, maybe the outer flare is indeed acrylic but the rest is legit crap plastic. Poor item descriptions, misleading at best. Returning."
2.0,The band is not good it’s hurts my wrist..
2.0,The armpit of it ripped after 4 wears
2.0,So disappointing charger not included😩
2.0,"Its okay, in my opinion the peacock looked kind of goofy and not much like a peacock at all up close (more like a swan and giraffe cross breed). The feather deatils is what makes this piece really standout. The rhinestones are so tiny you can't even tell they're there unless your up close. This is a standout piece for sure, i was just unimpressed with the overall quality. The fitting of this piece was not too good either, i had to make a few careful adjustments to get it to actually stay on my ear (which still didnt fit too securely). Be careful with adjusting this piece it is fragile and can easily be broken. The actual size of this ear piece is not that big either, but it's a suitable size for a look that won't appear too bulky."
2.0,This garment is ok as long as you really did not expect a sweatshirt. I was very disappointed.
2.0,"Material was too thin,very revealing, it was ok"
2.0,"The only reason for the 2 stars is I can NOT it is open again. I have tried just opening it, I've tried tweezers to get it open, I've tried everything I thing is tiny enough to open it. Nothing. I'm now stuck with the same pad I put in there.<br /><br />It's beautiful, has a good weight to it, and it does well for placing oils in it. But I just can't open it again."
2.0,The chain is clunky & the snowman isn’t well made. It’s going into the kids dress up box.
2.0,"Short, fits small, see through when stretched. Unflattering for my plus sized self"
2.0,It took forever to get here and I was disappointed in the quality. The metal was very cheaply made and not well sculpted. Would not buy again and had to find something else to gift to my Aunt. Will likely give this to young neice who will not notice the poor quality.
2.0,Not sure about this one--it really smells of gasoline. I am a curvy gal and this one seems to make me look wider. It IS really comfy but I can't really wear it because of the smell and I'm not sure if I should wash it or if that would make it harder to return. I'll keep you posted on my decision
2.0,"Not sure what size I received.  Ordered a 12 and cannot even put it on.  Seems like a size 6 to me.  I love the dress and wish I could get the right size, but I don't even know what size to order.  I think they just gave me what they had because there is no way this dress is a size 12."
2.0,Cute for the first week until the backing broke off.
2.0,Came with broken straps. Sad face.
2.0,The color is not what I ordered. Does not fit right
2.0,It's not actually white as advertised. It's cream with white trim. Not what I was looking for.
2.0,"This ring runs incredibly small. I wear a seven in almost every single ring and the seven that I received would probably fit more like a 5. It also was incredibly high up, probably a quarter of an inch almost above where it sits on your finger. There's just no way that this would be comfortable to wear everyday. I returned mine despite the fact that I had really high hopes that I would like it. It did have a nice sparkle."
2.0,It's ok for the price......
2.0,The strap was way too short to hang off your shoulder.  It was probably a full 3 feet shorter than the photo indicates.
2.0,Way to small pants were 4 inches  to short Too small to be a 4 and 5
2.0,"After about a month the rubber loop on 3 of the broke, under no pressure, since they were attached to glasses I had in different spots around my house, car and shop."
2.0,"The way this is made seems like the sleeves were too short no matter what size you have. The sweater looks very nice but after putting it on, the sleeves were very awkward. Love the design but disliked the fit."
2.0,Ordered item on 09/07/22 received today 09/09/22. The top on the side was torn. I'm going to have to return it.
2.0,The shirt looks cute but the material isn’t that great for what I payed.
2.0,"Im really disappointed, the fabric has a bad smell, the size was bigger than expected, the red is lighter color than the image and the fabric doesn't have a good feeling."
2.0,"Way too small, the material is a good quality, but these would not fit my 5 year old son. They are so tight, only a stick mannequin could wear them without cutting off circulation. The product is nice ifmonly they wear made for actual people to wear."
2.0,Size was ok.  Not good quality for the price!
2.0,"Bought the recommended size. Way too big. These are compression shirts but didn't hug any part of my arms or torso. Gave the product a two only because I can't comment on whether they moisture wick, protect from the sun or are good for working out. Perhaps they deserve a better rating."
2.0,"I am so disappointed. I open the box only to find there are words etched on each of the plastic lenses. I am guilty of skimming the full description too quickly and see now that the last line of the description mentions that. I think the photo is misleading, though, and should show the words as well. I was ordering these as cosmetic glasses and now can't use them. Here's hoping this review prevents someone else from making the same mistake. Two stars (instead of just one) because I think the frames themselves look as I had hoped."
2.0,Cheap and cheap looking!!
2.0,Cool shirt but it's a screen print that has faded in the wash already and far from high quality. It has turned into a &#34;stay at home shirt&#34; rather than something you would wear when trying to look &#34;nice&#34; -- I was hoping it was better quality for the price we paid.
2.0,Nothing really wrong with it.  just could do with the regular scrubs.
2.0,"With my postpartum belly, these are a staple, and I love how they keep everything 'tucked it'. Of course, they pill and get little holes in them eventually, but with this last order, the quality is subpar to begin with. I know they're inexpensive, but didn't expect just one time use. The photos show the leggings after one wear and wash. My search for an alternate legging brand begins."
2.0,These leggings are really thin and not flattering at all. They were almost purposely made to accentuate camel toe. I will not be purchasing anymore. They feel cheap.
2.0,"I gave these a 5 Star review when I originally bought them about 2 years ago.  After my most recent purchase, however, I had to update my review.  The ones in my most recent purchase are much thinner than previous pairs, the rubber nubs are not as effective at keeping me from slipping.  I nearly fell waking across a vinyl floor!  After just a week of wearing, the (not very useful) rubber grippers on the bottom are all falling off (at first I couldn’t figure out what the small purple discs were that I kept finding on the carpet).  I don’t know if this was just a bad batch or, more likely, if they have changed manufacturers and/or are cutting corners on materials to save money.  I guess I am going back to wearing the old, worn pair."
2.0,"These are not shorts, you can see thru them, they are more like semi-opaque control type panty hose."
2.0,Cute SM design for the hockey lover. But they fall out of the crocks constantly. Not worth the money.
2.0,"I already review this product. Like I said before, the blouse was made too small."
2.0,Smocked top not tight enough and overall thought it looked pretty cheap. I returned this.
2.0,"It was smaller than the sizing mentioned.  I usually wear a size 2 and bought size S.  It was rather tight on me.  Buttons were not matching the holes and thread was everywhere.  I guess it is just a cheap costume, though."
2.0,CHEAP LOOKING
2.0,"Im not sure about my size with this brand, I asked for another shirt in XL and it was so tigh and now I asked the same size and it was 3 sizes bigger than me... this supplier has a lot beatiful shirt but sadly I do not know what I have to expect when my purchase arrives, it will fit for me or should I give to my cousin."
2.0,Loved the feeling and bodycon style but the dress is see through. Had to return it
2.0,Just don’t like the fit all around. Nothing yoga about them. Tight elastic waistband makes it quite uncomfortable. Very thin material as well. They remind me of scrubs except scrubs are more comfortable.
2.0,It didn't fit my child correctly. Too big on the face.
2.0,"I thought this backpack was going to be perfect, it was a great size and I loved the design HOWEVER the first time I used it and the first leg of our 2 1/2 week backpacking trip the main strap broke!!!  I was able to tie it for the trip but this is a very poor quality bag.  If you are planning to check this backpack or need it to be reliable (and use it more than once)  I would recommend making an investment in a very high quality bag that is 3x the price.  If you are just taking this climbing or camping I think it would be great."
2.0,I returned it and chose another type of hat.
2.0,Skirt is pretty but it was too small. The chart they provided is wrong and way off. I bought what I thought was my size and I couldn't get this skirt pass my thighs. If you want that skirt size up.
2.0,The stems bent and will likely break off soon.
2.0,"I ordered what I thought would be a cool shirt like in the photo. I got something my great aunt, who is eighty, would wear. (No offense, great aunts who are 80.) Yeah, the fabric was better quality than expected, but it was different in color (the black version I ordered was grayer than I anticipated), and the cut was more of an A line, which was bulky and unflattering. One of the pockets wasn't sewn properly and arrived with two holes. Returned. Two stars since the fabric was really excellent, though, for this price point."
2.0,"The top wire protruding out making the breast area for a well endowed chest size cup C & greater. I run a large B but did not fill out the chest area. Otherwise, would have been a really nice suit but I think it was of second quality/defective with the wire thing being off from one side to another."
2.0,"It is not soft. fluffy Santa hats that I used to have.  It is cheap , paper like felt  that can torn easily, probably good for one time use."
2.0,Two tries and did get the fit desired
2.0,Liked this ring design a lot but mine broke after wearing it for two months. Finish came off after first four weeks. Runs very small. Pinky at best
2.0,Terrible elastic slouched clear down as soon as u put them on
2.0,"I didn't care for this bag once I got it.  I agree that it had a smell to it when I first opened it, but after airing out, it's fine.  It's bigger than I thought it would be and just not really what I expected."
2.0,"Too small, too thin"
2.0,"I ordered these in ""midnight blue,"" which is very close to the color depicted in the product image. I was worried about the color since I would definitely not describe it as ""midnight blue,"" but it was pretty perfect for what I needed. They are very typical Indian salwar, with a dropped waist and pleats/gathers at the hip that provide a poofy fit in the leg. However, I'm returning the pants due to length and construction.  The pants fit around me just fine, even though my hips are two inches larger than the max hip size in the description (I generally wear an XL / US size 14 or 16, and I'm definitely pear-shaped), but they are too short. They barely come to my ankles, and I'm only 5'7"". When I sit, they come half way up my shin.  Also, the pants are rather cheaply made, with small gaps in the seams that I'm sure will fall apart with wear. There is no drawstring or elastic in the waist, so there's no way to keep these pants up since the waist is quite generous (probably closer to 43"" than 40""). I could certainly rip some seams and add a drawstring myself, as well as fix the bad seam, but I can't make them longer."
2.0,The product came damage and dirty
2.0,GET A BIGGER SIZE THAN YOUR USUAL SIZE. IT'S ALSO A LITTLE TRANSPARENT
2.0,Did not expect to be So tight by Sellers sizes not accurate even for Bust size. Fit very tight no stretch I would like looser for these yet by size chart not correct. Maybe XL but rather have a bit more stretch that has none. More cotton
2.0,Soft material but that’s the only positive. I ordered a women’s large and this didn’t even fit my 11 year old daughter! Waaaaay too small.
2.0,The fabric isn’t what I expected. The laundering care is too picky. The fit is okay but I an afraid it will shrink dramatically if by oversight it should be thrown in the dryer. I won’t order or recommend this product.
2.0,Wish it was a little larger around my thighs.
2.0,"Much bigger then I realized , says it works for pandora braclets but it looks ridiculous as a pandora charm , much better for a necklace, but still kind of cheap .."
2.0,"I love the pattern, it's cute and comfortable but I've only been wearing maybe a week and the pattern is peeling off."
2.0,"Seems like a good product, but the size chart says that a large is equivalent to a ladies 12, but that is wrong as I normally wear and 8-10, and I couldn’t even try on these pants as they were just way too small.....very disappointing!!"
2.0,"I was very excited to receive these biker shorts.  I was barely able to pull them up and I ordered my normal size.  They kinda fit.  I recommend ordering a size up.<br /><br />The waist band does roll down on them, which can be annoying.<br /><br />Positives- the color is gorgeous, I ordered the green and the detail on the back is super cute."
2.0,"Good quality, but was hoping the length was a bit longer as seen in the picture."
2.0,my wife returned it. too big for her
2.0,"I own several blue fire opal pieces, and I LOVE sharks... so this was to be the perfect addition to my collection.  I was VERY disappointed!! The parts with the blue fire opal seem more like a blue sparked appoxy instead of a man-made gem stone.  It looks very cheezy! I will probably wear it, but if you get close.. it looks like I pored nail polish into my necklace.  :-("
2.0,"Is it funny? Yes.<br /><br />Well printed? Absolutely!<br /><br />Decent shirt? No.<br /><br />While it’s humorous and very well printed, I fear the print will outlast the shirt by years. The material is too thin to be worn as anything more than a night shirt, and the size is a touch on the small side. (Although the fabric is thin and stretchy, so maybe if you mutilate it, you can make it work?)<br /><br />Overall, very disappointing for the price."
2.0,had a funny pleat in front and back that stuck out at the waist
2.0,"Used the size chart and got a perfect fit. Workmanship on gloves was excellent. However the cotton material was fragile and thin, not suitable for any repeated use. Looking at the picture of the glove, I thought the material would be thicker and stronger. I am returning the gloves because the palm of the right glove had a line of tiny holes in the cotton knit, ready to open up and become big holes the first time the gloves were worn. This defect did not show up until I put the glove on, so it was not a defect that would easily be found by quality control. In my opinion these gloves are not worth the $9.50 price. Why waste the excellent workmanship on such poor quality material?"
2.0,this is not a slim fit shirt as advertised. It is pretty baggy.
2.0,I did not like the shoes because the Velcro  fell off after three months and the insoles were made of plastic which was extremely uncomfortable and caused me to have to get new insoles.
2.0,Looks super cute. But… tugged on it too hard I guess trying to put it on… fell apart!
2.0,"I want to love this band. It is pretty and more feminine than most of the other band options. It isn't heavy or bulky. It was relatively easy to put on the watch face. My husband did have to use extra tools to remove some of the pieces to make it smaller, but it was still easy enough. My number one issue though is that it won't stay clasped. With any little movement of my wrist it comes undone. Luckily it catches (like in picture), so my watch hasn't completely fallen off yet, but at some point I know it will. If this weren't an issue it would be 5 stars all the way."
2.0,The top fits larger than size chart states. The top is a lighter color than the bottom and pictures nor description state anything about 2 separate colors.
2.0,"FRYE excellent reputation, expensive. Had to have this purse even though it was pricier then I usually spend. It looked gorgeous great for NV. where I live and Chicago where I I come from . Great for both I figured.. I got the purse and was shocked. It is so stiff and as I put it on my shoulder there it laid cutting into my shoulder. Stiff and the inside nothing at the bottom but a covered board like bottom that flipped up and could hide anything loose. Stiff, cheaply made and it looks gorgeous in the picture. Vegan leather is a better choice and I am not a non leather person. It is on it's way back. I was left going on a trip no bag and my first Frye experience will be my last. I do personal shopping for people who like things I wear and have tested. I would never write a review like this but this is an expensive disappointment. MAYBE IT WAS JUST MINE????"
2.0,I dont care too much for it but I spend my money so I got to make use of it.
2.0,The top was the cutest but the bottoms were absolutely horrible! You could tell they were literally squares cut out of fabric.
2.0,"The lack of a fly on these mostly polyester blend boxer briefs is a deal breaker for my husband. He tried them on, found them a tad snug, but wouldn’t consider wearing them. Most men, and he is one of them, don’t want to go through what women do every time we need to do our business— essentially undress from the waist down. With these briefs, he’d have to do that, and I don’t blame him that he won’t. I looked closely at the stitches and there isn’t a way to pull threads away to open up a fly without remaking the garment. And, frankly, the fabric isn’t that pleasant to the touch. So, a definite not recommended on this one."
2.0,"The picture looks so awesome. Unfortunately, it didn't fit me close to the pic. Way too much fabric that makes the waves and details get kind of lost. The bust area is also bigger than you would expect for this style."
2.0,The purse looks like the picture but it has a strong polyurethane smell to it.  I rated it low because of the smell and the lack of lack of inside compartments.
2.0,Thought they were for children. These are for adults
2.0,Yellow ones r too light and black ones r too dark
2.0,"The print on the shirt is a low quality iron on, I don't think this shirt will make it through very many wash cycles before the print wears off."
2.0,"I'm not sure if it's because of the hot climate where i live or because it's not genuine leather but i did'nt get to use this bag much at all because it started peeling in a couple of months ,so sorry but i had to throw it  away really was a beautiful bag."
2.0,broke in one week with no major cause
2.0,Waaaaay too short. Otherwise cute
2.0,[[VIDEOID:da9967a341f55ebcd9dc27d08e2d6aab]] Las botas llegaron dañadas y mal cocidas! Están raspadas como si ya fueran usadas. Las terminaciones del cocido están mal acabadas y llego hasta descocido.
2.0,Not good reading glasses at all ... slightly distorted vision in one lens and the earpieces are very tight and press in on the side of your head.
2.0,"It was broken when it arrived, i fixed it but it broke again in the same spot. Heh, you get what you pay for i guess"
2.0,"My girlfriend ordered these shirts for us and my shirt fit fine, but her shirt was way too small. The shirts for the women run way too small. We can't return it to get a different size because we already bought the largest size. The size of the shirts for women should match the men's but the 2XL for men and women weren't the same; the men's shirt was significantly bigger than the women's.<br />The quality of the shirt is great, so it's really disappointing that the sizes for women are so off. This shirt would have been perfect if the size's went to 3XL for women as well, so in the future I suggest supplying larger sizes for women."
2.0,2 stars just because quality is poor. But cheap enough to give an extra star because you can sit on them and not break your heart/wallet!<br /><br />Second set already!<br /><br />UPDATE - Ordered a 3rd pair  - AND THEY BROKE TOO! same issue as the others. The metal hinge snapsafter 2-3 months.<br /><br />Okay okay I gotta stop being cheap - this happens too much!
2.0,Disappointed with the clarity of these stick-on readers.  It's like reading through an aquarium.  Not the crisp clear view I expected.
2.0,not long enough in the inseam
2.0,Tooooo heavy looks very cheesy
2.0,"I have 3 dogs and as soon as I put these on them, they instantly wanted to chew on each other’s (not an issue with the product). However, the tags are silicone and the battery is poorly secured with a silicone cover. Easy to pop out and be lost and/or ingested. If the batteries were better secured, this would be a decent product."
2.0,Color is more green than khaki
2.0,"Only received 3 of the 4, contacted seller still haven't heard back. the three I received are as described and ok."
2.0,"I am disappointed in this product. Yes the cups are soft. And yes it covers well on the sides. However, it is scratchy under the arms and where the straps are sewn in the front. I don't know if its the material or they used nylon thread to sew this. Either way I now have a itchy rash under my arms and on my chest. I didn't see any difference as far as posture correcting. I wouldn't purchase this again."
2.0,"I was disappointed in the stitching of the shirt . There were parts of shirt where stitching was overlapped , loose threading , in my opinion the sewing of shirt is poor . Fit was a little small for a 2xl shirt ."
2.0,"I expected from the picture the letters to be raised. It has a shadow effect which makes it look blurry. A little pricey for what I received, maybe worth $5.  Mounting holes are too big for the plastic sign."
2.0,"I ordered the green dress with off-white, irregular spots. (WOWULOVELY Women's Casual Summer Dress V-Neck Short Sleeve Maxi Dress A-Line Floral Printed Long Dresses)  I'm a 38DD and usually a L or XL. I purposely sized up as much as possible and ordered the XXL. The bust was still almost 4"" too small (more, if you'd want a blousy look as shown). And the 'waistline,' which comes with a drawstring, was HIGH empire--immediately under the bustline. Returned. Too bad--the fabric was lightweight and would have been nice for the summer, although at 5'5"" I might have had it hemmed--the skirt is pretty long."
2.0,"This shirt is really cheap quality. I bought a large and it’s pretty snug. A large is usually really roomy. The cuffs around the wrists are really tight as is the elastic around the waist. This is not a sweatshirt type hoodie (it says this in the description). It is thin, like a T-shirt material. The design is made of a thick vinyl feeling material. I hope it doesn’t crack after washing. The shirt has no brand inside. It just says “L MADE IN CHINA”. Overall I’m disappointed but I need the shirt for a Jeep event coming up and I needed something Prime and I don’t have time to have something else shipped."
2.0,Decal is not that bright looks faded out of wrapper. For 40 bucks could be made better.
2.0,I wear a 4/6 and the sweater was a bit too snug. The shoulders also fit awkwardly. Returned.
2.0,back light weak and can't read. I used to have illuminator so back to that one. day watch only no workee. .
2.0,I bought this mask for my dad. He loved Alfred E Newman. I was so exited to see him open this package and try this mask on. I was very desapointed. This face mask does not look like the mask on a picture at all. To big and looks like a monkey face. I do not recommend this face mask.
2.0,"The bag looked to be of good quality, guess I should have read reviews.  I bought for boyfriend that travels with job and always leaves things behind.  I wanted to get something he could hang up and keep ALL his things in one place and just fold up and pack on check out day.  It was not what I would call medium.  It was very small.  No shampoo bottle would fit in it.  In fact, it would have been hard to fit everything in his small shaving bag much less shampoo, bath wash, etc. That he currently sticks in duffle or suitcase."
2.0,"Nice looking, but cheaply made, the eyelet on the glass gem bezel broke off after only three days of my daughter having it."
2.0,The dress is very pretty and true to the pictures! But is not even close to sixe. I wear a 12/14 usually. 12s fit perfectly.  I ordered 14 just in case it was made a little smaller. It wouldn't go over my hips at all. So I don't know how sizing is for the rest of the dress.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress but it was an odd length, was too big, and just looked sloppy on me. If you can get a size that works/have a tailor or sewing skills it might work better for you. The color was exactly as pictured (bright red). Other comments said it runs small but I disagree— I ordered the Large and I probably would have had to get a Small. It doesn’t have any stretch, but I’d say start with your normal size."
2.0,Delivered today. Smaller than expected. Strap broke after two hours. Piece of junk.
2.0,"This is a lot more gray that it is blue and the fit is quite odd, Returning."
2.0,I measured around the palm and knuckles they were still too tight and the fingers were about .75 inches too long
2.0,Dress was quite pretty but unfortunately I can't wear it the sleeves are to tight around my arms so I just put it away thanks anyway
2.0,"Not as good compression as another company I tried. I would not recommend them. However, older people might find these easier to put on and take off."
2.0,"I was really excited to get this dress, I got a size up since I thought it would fit me more. Sadly, it didn't. The dress looked nothing like the picture and the color didn't even match."
2.0,The lights stopped functioning as soon as the next day
2.0,Bought in large and skirt was good but the square that has the strap thing is not made bigger for bigger sizes the model is prolly a small so it works for her but if you a large or bigger don’t waist your money material was kind itchy as well
2.0,"I wear a womens size 12-14 bottoms and when I ordered the Xl, I assumed they would fit. Was I ever WRONG! They looked like a childs XL. I gave them to my daughter who wears a size 2. On a positive note...I did like the pockets."
2.0,I ordered a white. It came egg shell white. Quality is good. It fit good. It’s just the wrong color.
2.0,Seams already coming unstitched and I haven't worn it once.... And way too large.
2.0,"ruptured in first use,bad stiching not holding in water beads. very very slow delivery by amazon fulfillment wherehouse, drop shipped to them from china, where amazon is secretly flooded the market with. Product<br />absorbs water,but does not stay cool for very long. very disappointed in amazon. which should be boycotted."
2.0,The size was what I expected but they were so mashed flat that they would not conform to the curve of the shoulder. I will not be able to use them. Very disappointed and will probably return if I cannot take them apart and mold them.
2.0,"I like the &#34;Hamsa&#34; very much, but the chain is so short that I just could not wear it.  I went and had to buy a longer chain for it to look good. I can't use that little chain... something else to be buried in my jewelry box"
2.0,Wear! These shoes run small buy the next size up! And the coral color is not coral it’s salmon!
2.0,"First off, there was no size selection, so i had to stick with the wrong size and hope i could get it resized later. Second, the rings are tiny. Way smaller than the picture suggests. In fact, they're about half the size they appear to be."
2.0,"Not terrible, but material was really rough, would not order again"
2.0,My glasses broke in one day :(
2.0,"Great looking watch, but tried making the band smaller to fit my normal wrist, and it does not fit.  You cannot remove any of the links. I should have read the reviews. Not worth the trouble to send it back....give it to a family member."
2.0,Very cheap product and the ears are a bit small.
2.0,It did not fit the person I bought it for which I find very odd. She doesn’t have unusually large wrist so I am embarrassed.
2.0,"They look really beautiful but when I tried them on, I felt the threading giving way. Now I'm scared of even wearing it a second time"
2.0,They didn't fit well and they did not seem polarized.
2.0,"I feel like this is a bracelet a traveler might buy to support a good cause--a poor villager in a remote location with limited supplies.  The stone is rough and looks like it was picked up off the ground and merely washed.  The stone in my bracelet looks like a corner broke off, but the craftsman soldered it into place anyway.  The soldering is well done, though, and not likely to release the stone.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, the findings and chain are not of the same materials, and they look cheaply made and could be easily broken.  The ""S"" clasp is difficult to navigate with one hand, and it requires the metal to be bent, which means it is weakened and will likely break.  The weight of the stone causes the bracelet to slide around the wrist, so it's not easy to see while wearing.  As the stone matches my skin color, it's really not easy to see regardless.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product unless the quality of the materials improves, the stones are more polished and weigh less, and maybe some other pinkish beads were added for more bling around the wrist.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for this review."
2.0,Diferente a la imagen de la publicación muchas costuras al frente😒
2.0,The chains in the kits began to fade when I opened it and the pearls were stripping. All the gold pieces began to fade
2.0,I ordered a 2xl and the label says the size but the dress seems more a medium. Big size difference.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f3695faf26b7926c49eacff17fd0c84e]] I ordered this because it said dragonfly on it but as you can see all the dragonflies are cut off and mostly only see butterflies.
2.0,"It was a nice dress, but for me just didn't look as expected. Felt a little matronly"
2.0,They arrived very timely but the quality was not what I expected.
2.0,"My 7 year old daughter is absolutely obsessed with spider man and was really excited to get this dress. Which she then wore for all of 3 minutes (over long sleeves and long pants) before wanting to take off because it was itchy. It feels poorly and cheaply made, and the zipper kept catching at the seam between the top and skirt, needing to be fiddled with a bit to get past it. 7yo can get in and out of all the rest of her costumes herself, but there's no way she'd be able to get into and out of this one without help with the zipper. We got the size 130/L and she's on the tall side for 7, and also skinny as a beanstalk, so it did look a bit ill-fitting: it fit well enough, but the sleeves looked like they'd slip off her shoulders easily."
2.0,Not as drapey as I would have liked and a little on the small side.
2.0,"This was an extra large, but it was so tight through the shoulders and the back. It looked more like a medium."
2.0,"The product definitely runs small, a 38B is actually a 34B. Otherwise, it appears as advertised. Lesson learned in buying from international sellers, it's not worth returning because of the item's inexpensive price."
2.0,Not a size 12. Not an XL. Not for ppl with hips and booty. Couldn’t get on. Not stretchy at all! Kinda like linen but actually polyester. Disappointed. Don’t label it an extra large when it’s a size 8!! Waste of time n money
2.0,"While the description said jacket with hamaka and belt, the order is only the jacket. While I like the jacket, I was not happy that it was the only part I ordered and not worth the money paid the the entire outfit."
2.0,"Fortunately, I sew and make these work.  They don't fit well.  I am a trim woman and 5'8&#34; tall. The sleeves sis not cover my arm up to the short sleeves of my golf shirt.  They also were VERY tight.  My BMI is normal (not overweight).  I don't know where they are manufactured but my guess is somewhere women are more petite than American women."
2.0,"The fit was fine, but they are a little bit see through. Not too bad but enough that I'd want a long shirt. I also wouldn't really say they have tummy control, as there's no compression in the wide waistband at all. The worst bit though, and my ultimate reason for returning them, is the pocket seams. They are loose and not attached so the seams can wander around and generally just look unsightly and ruins any streamlining. They are very soft but the material is thin and I do not believe they'd hold up for long. Lovely color, though! Unfortunately, I'm returning them. :("
2.0,they are okay but I thought there would be a cotton cotch and there is not and they ride up so they are not comfortable and they are the back up on laundry day.
2.0,Haven't been able to even put it on. Its cut VERY small even if you follow the size chart.<br /><br />Totally disappointed.
2.0,Not as bright as I thought the middle would be
2.0,"The shirt fits as expected, but material, while it isn't clingy, it is rough and cheap.  The back is much longer than the front.  It does not look as dressy as the picture depicts."
2.0,"I like that it fits me well, I like the inseam and the material is real nice..  However I'm quite disappointed in the belt and the fake buttons and zipper in front, The belt is way too long, it's doesn't match the waist size of the skirt, I think they're using only 1 or 2 belt sizes from Small to XXL, so if your a XL or XXL it shouldn't be a issue.. I just need one more eyelet so the belt doesn't hang down.. Also, the 2 snaps in front are for show, they don't snap into anything, so if the belt is loose, the flap with the snaps hangs out as well... As for the zipper in front, its functions but it doesn't have any purpose, it's for show, I don't mind it, but the belt and snap issue I do mind.. It's too bad, because I really like it otherwise."
2.0,I love it but after using it for a week the strings started ripping and unfortunately I can’t wear it anymore. I would get the real rope one because it’ll probably last longer.
2.0,Wrong size too big.
2.0,"I'm a 34C  (maybe more in the middle of C and D, but not a full D).  Per the listing directions I sized up in the band and the cup, so went with the 36D.  While I will say this bra pretty good for support, and excellent for creating cleavage, my boobs were overfilling the cups so much that I wasn't sure I could wear it through the day without a nipple popping out.  Also, I had to have the band at the first position and that was even too tight for comfort.  Had to return this one.  Based on the listing, it doesn't look like there is a bigger cup size than D (which again, was too small for my C sized breasts), so I guess there's no bigger size I can try, and certainly if you are regularly a D or larger I would highly doubt this bra would fit you at all."
2.0,The belt was too wide.
2.0,"Too hard to close the clasp for me , sorry"
2.0,"I bought an XL, but it’s more like a medium but it is cute."
2.0,First and foremost this is not a filter or filtering mask. I was misled to believe that it was. In fact it is not a filtering mask.
2.0,"One of them fits me perfectly. The other two are awkwardly shaped.<br /><br />After one wash, none of them are wearable. Waste of money."
2.0,I thought these would be similiar to Kenkoh sandles but they are not even close. This nubs on the bottom felt great. The bottom of the sandles are too hard. I ordered my usual size 10 which was ok for length but they barely fit between the footbed and straps. The straps give me blisters after wearing for only 20 minutes. Sending these back and spending the extra money for the real kenkohs.
2.0,The bar is to thin for any of my ball tops
2.0,They are beautiful bracelets but I recommend getting the 10mm beads they look much better only problem is that the string started showing after the 1st wear.
2.0,The bathing suit is cute but the top is poorly made - wish I could still return. Every time I raise my arms up the top comes up. It has no garter to hold it in place. I gave a 2 stars cause atleast the bottom fits nice.
2.0,I love the design on the sweatshirt. The ordered a size larger than usual and it still is very close on the sleeves especially as well as length. The width is fine. The material isn’t the best quality. I feel like it’s going to shrink with the first wash and not fit me anymore. Also the blue line is advertised as a very saturated blue. The blue line that is actually embroidered onto to sweatshirt is really dark not easily noticeable.
2.0,The size was smaller then discribe
2.0,Love the colors but was too big. Fabric was thin and stiff with colors only on one side. Fabric started to pill up a lot after only one wear.
2.0,pretty but very fragile! broke right away.
2.0,The ball came out of the the piece that holds them together within a month. Lucky I didn’t loose any keys. Would not recommend
2.0,fits strangely.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4cd1bd42a4ab9e183a96ca75aa1b7b1c]] The pants seem like they would fit great excluding the fact that they are broken. The vest was overly snug. I am not sure what to do. I believe if I would go up a size in the vest that the pants would be too big. I’m sending it back for being broken and the best too small.
2.0,"I am a curvy girl . Height 5”6ish , weight 180lbish... these sat really high pretty much under my breast .. the inseam area was long and rode up. The length was short ‘ basically high waters’. These rode as you wore them def not comfortable. I returned them"
2.0,will have to sew hope the other pants dont tear since the turqousie pair is on the seam
2.0,Received one set not the other two as promised. I returned due to after Christmas arrival.
2.0,Adorable. Warm. Baby had no problem wearing them. Unfortunately the sole separated from the slipper after wearing them for only 5 hours
2.0,"Cute, but the pair I received did not fit.  They were larger than a 2ga.  I checked their size with my micrometer.  They were closer to a 0ga.  I tried to lightly dremel and sand them down to fit and then first one snapped.  The wood is a little fragile."
2.0,I really like them but I wish they weren't see through!
2.0,I'm a size six and the medium spanx cami was so tight I could hardly breathe. I want the old version back - core control but free waistline and bust line.  TOO TIGHT
2.0,Watch looks awesome but runs slow.  I have to readjust the time forward five minutes every 45 minutes.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Like costume
2.0,"Fits very small. I'm normally a medium in every brand, sometimes a small. I ordered a large in this and it was too small to be comfortable for me, especially with this kind of fabric that shows every bump and imperfection. Order 2 sizes up unless your body is perfect. Also the string for the ties came seperate so I would have to thread them. Not a big deal if I loved the top other wise but just annoying."
2.0,Felt like seat would split if i sat down in them. Company did accept return without question.
2.0,I had high hope me and my husband both have size 9 feet and they stretch and distort. Not very stretchy more like nylon that has no give
2.0,Bunny not the same size as shown above. It's small and oddly placed on the actual romper. Very disappointed
2.0,"Beautiful to look at, but not sturdy enough to wear all the time. The bracelet metal is very thin and I was afraid to bend it to fit on my wrist and unbend it to take it off  because it feels as if it is going to break. Metal is very thin. Wore once, now sitting on dresser just looking pretty."
2.0,This product is good for the price but the removable wheelbase was bad designed.  My child used over 3 months<br />for high school but wheel fall off and base was broken.
2.0,The back is short
2.0,Need to size up if you want it a little bit looser. Mine had a hole where the pocket seam was. Returning for replacement
2.0,"This tie is MADE IN CHINA and this is not specified in the product description. It should. Honestly, this is probably a below $10 tie."
2.0,"I loved the pictures of this dress online. I was very excited when it arrived. Like others have said, it's not accommodating of a bigger chest, but manageable. However, while I know the hemline is not supposed to be even all the way around, I had one side literally dragging on the ground and the other side at my ankles. Very sloppy work. I'll be returning it."
2.0,"Very thin material, does not come with the filter insert for the mask. Overall not worth the money spent."
2.0,Pretty cute… even though two of the sets were very different from the images shown … even the overall size differed.
2.0,Some are un-usable.
2.0,You can see throw them and they are really tight i should of got a size bigger
2.0,Fell apart before I ever wore them!
2.0,Lasted only 1 month. Also coating started to peelnoff with in 3 weeks.
2.0,Even at the price I purchased this hat at it is not worth the price
2.0,"Loved the boots at first, now after my son has worn them a week the entire front of each shoe is wearing away and becoming discolored.  I wish they would hold up longer than a week of use but the cheap material used on the outside is extremely thin and gets worn off very fast."
2.0,"These socks are a generous weight and fit nicely, but the non-slip rubber melted in the dryer after the second washing. Having to air dry them makes them impractical for me but if you're willing to do that they should be fine for you."
2.0,The arm part of this is very small & made with a completely different material.
2.0,"It's got a great look but it's terrible as a backpack unless you're a tiny person... I am not a tiny person! I was hoping for one of those big beautiful, you know, Nomad- type backpacks... I didn't get that with this! It's way too small to be a backpack!"
2.0,"The fit was as expected however the belt was really short and couldn’t fit at all.<br /><br />Although the patter was lovely, the material was like paper! Light weight and easy to see through. Whenever I wear this it has to be with black underwear and I have to always be holding it down as it easily flies away with the wind"
2.0,"the size run very small, i got an 2X but it fits like an XL, but other than love the color and the look on me"
2.0,Husband got this for me. Not red like in the picture and super small.
2.0,It fitbgreat but material is cheap and shiny. It would be okay for gymnastics but not for a ballet class. I kept it because my daughter will play dress up in it but go for a brand name pink leotard if you need it for ballet.
2.0,Que es más pequeña de lo que esperaba y la calidad de la tela no es de mi agrado
2.0,Purchased as a gift.  2 of them broke on first use.  We only tried out 2. Going to return.
2.0,"I've returned this item because of the way the zippers hang.  They're not flush at all, but quite &#34;bumpy.&#34;"
2.0,It broke after 1 month. Not very good for daily use. Didn't seem to block out much of the noise. Barely worth the 10 bucks.
2.0,"These are NOT kids masks. I’m an adult and bought them for my 5 year old step daughter and they did not fit her at all. Fell right off her face and was way too big. They fit my face perfectly and they are good quality, just disappointed that they are labeled as kids masks but they do not fit kids."
2.0,Straps and stitching are already pulling and tearing
2.0,It definitely runs very small. I would say it's junior sizes. if you are an A cup it might fit you.
2.0,"I love over-the-head dresses like this one.  Fit is fine, always LOVE pockets, but the fabric is of extremely poor quality.  I've worn mine twice and the fabric finish already shows 'wear', with abraded fibers.  I wash jersey only with silky fabrics like lingerie to extend their shelf-life, but I don't expect to wear this one more than half a dozen times until I throw it away.  If it were ever washed with something like a pair of jeans, it would be toast!"
2.0,"As many have mentioned, the hoodie runs small. I ordered up a size (XL) and it was still snug in the waist. The seller's description said there's stretch, but there is none in the style I purchased. The material isn't sweatshirt material either...it's slick & heavy with a slight sheen. I've had joggers in a similar material and they snagged like crazy. I'd imagine this hoodie would do the same. It also doesn't really look like the image texture (slightly worn & heathered) either, which is what I wanted. Lastly, there's a a funky odor that's different than the ""new clothes smell"". PeeEww.<br /><br />*I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the colors do match the image."
2.0,The zipper keeps getting stuck and it’s really annoying!  Otherwise it’s a pretty bag.
2.0,"Ordered an XL, so incredibly small. Immediately returned."
2.0,Product did not fit the description. Had to return.
2.0,This was a beautiful dress but made small.
2.0,I purchased an XL after reading the reviews and I can't get it over my hips (I normally wear a M to L).  The material is extremely thin.  I haven't decided to if I should send back or keep and give to a friend.
2.0,"This item is much smaller than I had imagined and the shipping was so high that I won't return it.  $8 shipping for a $13 t shirt.  It is also not long as described, just a regular shirt length. I ordered with a bunch of other items and was told it is free shipping so all around, no pleased."
2.0,"Love the bag and design, it's has a strong odor"
2.0,"The stems are so small, they are hard to put on."
2.0,sizing is not right  service is exceptional
2.0,Was way smaller than I expected. It is pretty tiny.
2.0,Soooooo see through!
2.0,Difficult to get on even with the rasyom directions
2.0,I like the color and of course the embroidered message but am not thrilled with its lack of stiffness. The main part of the hat is ill  fitting because of this.
2.0,Please be careful. I bought three. Its not waterproof.
2.0,"TOO SMALL! I am 5'8, 165lbs so not really that big and usually fit in large sizes. That being said wheb I took them.out of the bow I noticed the amount of elastic in the waist band was going to make them snug??? The first time I put them on, the split in the crotch!! So upsetting! But, if you run on the smaller side these could be a really cute, cheap option"
2.0,"The blue is not blue, its a magenta.  I don't like magenta."
2.0,I received the purse with the strap ripped off. I need it for an outfit so I’m going to try to repair it.
2.0,"Not true to size I I couldn't zip it, move around felt like I was suffocating & the length were short look like I was flooding. I order a xxl. My bust is a 36DDD & I’m 200 lbs. I’m sending mines back I mean I like the jumpsuit just not on me."
2.0,This cardigan is VERY thin and VERY long and much larger than I expected.
2.0,Not at all what I expected.  Doesn’t look anything like it’s picture.
2.0,It might because I'm small (5'5 120lbs) but I got a small and I can't wear it. It's too big and awkward. Would have to wear high waisted pants to cover the part above the butt cause it's really baggy. The description didn't say that the thigh holes go up above the hip bones. Very bay watch
2.0,"I should have expected this quality given the price I paid, but these convertible mittens are pretty cheaply made.  The velcro is barely secured, as well as the faux suede palm.  I didn't notice the full thumb at the time of purchase, but it really defeated the purpose for my use of these convertible mittens. These was a distinct chemical smell from the packaging and the fit was really snug."
2.0,"Not terrible but the fit is strange. Waist hits in the wrong spot. Not great material, pretty think but could be wearable if you got the right fit."
2.0,"I wish I could call Amazon and get my money back! The watch started to leak and vapor formed under the glass. I just had it about 8 months of normal use. Meaning I took it off at night and only put it on during the duty day. I don't know how the leak happened. anyways, I would not purchase again."
2.0,This hat is reversible so if you like to ware the outside fliped up it will be blue on top and brown around the inner bill ...
2.0,I was expecting a dark lens but when I received them they weren't very dark at all. Average sunglass tint. Love the look and fit tho.
2.0,"It actually appeared to be a pretty well constructed hat and looked nice like it did in the online photos, except for the fact that it was crushed and creased everywhere because they shipped it in an envelope.  No choice but to return."
2.0,Boys Large is very big...bigger than a women's Medium. It is way too big for my 10 year old grandson. Love the graphic though so I ordered another in a Medium.
2.0,Dislike 👎<br /><br />Very thin
2.0,"The clamps are held onto the chain by really flimsy keyring, which broke almost immediately when I pulled to tighten the clamp."
2.0,"Edit: It’s only been 3 months and these tights have not held up. I just crouched down and the fabric could not hold the strain and ripped all the way down my right thigh. The black color is nice, but I would not buy this tan color again. I am incredibly disappointed, and this was a waste of money.<br />---<br />I’m 5 foot 3 inches and generally a size 26 womens pants. These fit perfectly for me, plenty of flexibility. I got a tan color and a black color. My favorite part is the top of it; the grip holds on all day while I’m walking around at a conference, and it’s a cute design.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the material feels thick but my tan pair has already gotten a small hole after two all-day wears full of activities. Maybe not the toughest quality but I would buy again for the design and price."
2.0,Fast shipping although was a LOT of fabric ! Not for me.
2.0,I was disappointed too big not what I wanted
2.0,Larger than I expected and the material feels too much like plastic.
2.0,"NO UNDERWIRE.<br /><br />The product description is wrong. There is absolutely no underwire in this bikini. It does not have push up bra pads - they are just normal thickness pads. The “support” in this top is little to nonexistent for women above a C cup.<br /><br />The bra pads are stiff and move around freely in the entire front half of the top, making it awkward when you are tubing or spending a day at the beach with rough waves that can knock them out of place. Get ready to constantly adjust to look decent and feel comfortable!<br /><br />The back of the top is much longer than the front. It scoops down lower and rests lower, where it tends to bunch up and fold (and not look nice) on women with shorter torsos.<br /><br />The bottoms fit great and come up nice and high like advertised. They do not bunch or fold. They do come up higher in the back than the front, so paired with this top they overlap instead of leaving a gap. I have a short torso so that could be the problem!<br /><br />Pattern and colors true to picture."
2.0,The sizing was off. They are fitting at the ankle and they are to small up top.
2.0,"Waist band is way too hard, tight and uncomfortable. The length of this pants is too short. Only thing I like about this pants is the weight - it’s pretty light fabric."
2.0,2 of then broke right away other than that I would've given 5 stars
2.0,Straps felt a bit inferior.
2.0,"From a distance it looks nice but up close the orange isn’t right, but the real problem is that the discoloration is fast!"
2.0,Lost the shine 🤔
2.0,its way to small and no key chain on it
2.0,Its cute but it just looks like they cut the shirt and didnt even bother to sew it better....its still okay for a house shirt
2.0,"I wear a size 14 and have a 40"" bust, so ordered an XL size. Even before washing, it is a super-tight fit and not very flattering. I seldom wear it, and only do wear it under jackets, but the lace on top is pretty and very feminine when it shows at the neckline.  I'd order a size larger than usual if you have a large bust line and abdomen."
2.0,Hard to read and the six position was represented by a IV.
2.0,Necklace is falling apart
2.0,Very comfortable but really disappointed in how they are cracking..
2.0,They ripped after the first wash
2.0,OK for the price but barely mirrored which is what I wanted.
2.0,The front pockets aren't. They are fake pockets. Very very disappointing.
2.0,"The product is poorly made and looks cheap, I doubt it will stand up very long before it is broken."
2.0,"Very thin. It was very cute, but way to think to wear."
2.0,"I have bought no brand of handbag other than Coach for the past 38 years. I am a devoted and die-hard fan. I love the look of this bag, but I cannot understand why they didn’t make it just a tiny bit bigger so I don’t have to fight with it every time I pull out my wallet and have to fit it back in there. The interior design of this thing is maddening. I won’t even complain that the fabric is wearing away after only a year.  I would still love it if my Coach wallet would fit comfortably inside! First time I have ever given anything but a rave review for a Coach product."
2.0,"Material is very thin. The sizing is way off.  Fits like a 1x,  supposed to be a 3x."
2.0,Liked the style.  Did NOT care for fabric
2.0,Not elegant at all
2.0,Very delicate. Fell off my daughter's finger and she did not notice.
2.0,"Ordered size 18, fits like a 14. Runs really small. Ordered another pair of wallflower jeans before this and they fit perfect. Wouldn't buy these again."
2.0,"The masks are well made and the cotton material is good but there is a difference between the video and description of your product and the actual size. It's smaller and I was expecting a large size for adults, Just as you show in the video. Need to correct this issue. I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed. The video is showing a large size and you are sending a small mask for adults."
2.0,After reading all the positive reviews I decided to order this cover-up. When I received it I was so disappointed. The fabric is flimsy and shapeless and a lot of the threading was already coming undone and even falling off! It's a shame because it was exactly the style I was looking for.
2.0,Fits weird and is short. Not good for tall girls.
2.0,This product feel like plastic. I thought it would have a metal feeling. The bracelet is dull and not as shiny as it looks in the picture.
2.0,Crappy cheap
2.0,Thought this was sterling silver and it was bendable plastic could have got it from a bubble gum machine if I knew it was hella cheap don't buy this product
2.0,"These are fairly cheap earmuffs, not to say they don't help cause anything will. But they are cheaply made."
2.0,The leather band is nice and seems to be okay quality. However the metal connectors slip right off my watch no matter how hard I try to connect them. This makes the band unusable unless you put different metal connectors on.
2.0,"The colour faded after a month, but it was a beautiful pice of ear jewelry while it lasted......if only it was durable, but can't complain because you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I really love the look of these earrings but the holes for inserting the posts are not lined up well and they are too hard to put on. I should have returned, but I waited too long to try them out."
2.0,"I bought this item from Amazon.com , and it arrived in a timely manner. If you're looking for a very temporary subtle fix, this is the product for you. However, if you're looking for something sturdy and long lasting - look away! This sizing guard broke about half a month after I bought it. It fit fairly well on my small ring, but I think it could have been convenient to use had it been larger."
2.0,"Definitely not what was pictured,  but they're ok"
2.0,"These were just not good, they came squished in a bag and seemed to be permanently deformed as a result. Size was way too small for what was ordered which was supposed to fit men's 10.5-11 wide foot, the packaging said this sizing as well.<br /><br />Pro : Fairly cheap.<br /><br />Con : Very uncomfortable shaping.<br />Con : Packed squished in a bag which caused them to deform, this might fix itself with wearing though.<br />Con : Size was way too small for what was ordered.<br />Con : Texture of material was unpleasant against feet."
2.0,I love the gemstone but unfortunately this jewelry piece is very small even for me.  I am petite size.
2.0,"While this was an inexpensive item, the picture looks substantially better than the actual item.  It was packaged in a simple small ziploc-style bag which probably contributed to the chain being smashed in one area upon arrival, and the stones were not nearly as bright as the picture indicated. If you are looking for a gift, you should probably look elsewhere. Not very impressive."
2.0,Colors pretty.  Fit not good
2.0,"The top fit decent but the clasp in the back is as cheap as they come, waiting to rust, come undone and just too flimsy to be left for chance. The bottoms were high rise shorts with an odd lenth, the exact opposite of the photos, advertisements, and measurements. I tried folding them over and it worsened the appearance of the swimsuit. I decided to keep it for the top, because although the color purple was as dark as purple gets, it matched a pair of light teal right amount of coverage bottoms & still gave me the mermaid look. I replaced the back clasp with a clear Walmart craft section clasp. I really needed a mermaid looking bikini with a few other fails & a short amount  of time to put something together this won, but I wouldn't recommend it based on what you see here."
2.0,"I have a pair of skinny high waisted Clingers pants and I love them so I decided to buy these with high hopes. I bought a size 9 in the other pants so thought these would fit in a 9 also.  Nope, they run extremely small!  Maybe 2 sizes too small. I unfortunately took off the tags and wanted them before I tried them on. They're a nice pair of parents, but way too small."
2.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I bought her a 2X (largest size).  Upon receipt, the shirt obviously runs small and I was sure that it would not fit her.  The top, in my opinion, also looks very cheaply made.  The material is thin and the sewing on the seams looks cheaply done.  It was not a gift that I was able to give to my daughter.  My intention is to return the shirt."
2.0,"This looked nothing like the picture. I'm a size 12, 5'2&#34; and this dress was so tight and so short, that I felt like a slutty little hooch... in an XL!!<br />I was looking for a loose tunic top (you know, like the picture) to wear with leggings.<br />Unfortunately this has already been returned to Amazon. No pics - it wouldn't have passed their public decency standards 🙁"
2.0,"Review will not allow me to attach a photo, but it does not look as nice as pictured and is less than 2 inches high. I didn’t expect this to be super nice and elaborate for $12- but I did expect the pin to be able to close. It’s much smaller than the picture makes it look and the pin clasp is attached crooked so I can’t close it."
2.0,I normal get these and it's either a hit or a miss.<br />This was a miss. They were perfect and beautiful except the screw itself was to big for my ear. So when I finally got one in I had to take it out I could not take the ache on my ears.
2.0,I dislike the loose garter because it was too big for me only the string that holds!!not too happy for my purchase
2.0,"I liked the material, it's light and flowing for casual beach attire. The pants do not have an elastic waist, so a tight fit over hips then loose on waist. But they are long enough and comfortable. The top is just weird. I couldn't get it tied in a way that stayed on. Won't wear the top in public since my boobs fall out the bottom."
2.0,I like the look of this product but it broke after about a week.
2.0,"Very soft and warm however they have a funny smell, and elastic/material shreds and leaves strings easily. Fall apart quickly"
2.0,"These are obviously knock-offs of Ray-Ban Clubmasters, but we know that. I'm not complaining about that. My problem is that the photo shows a pair of sunglasses that are sort of rounded on the bottom. They are actually thin and narrow. They look stupid. I had some lenses I was hoping to fit into theses if they were the same shape as Clubmasters, but they're not. I would have worn them as sunglasses, but they just look too weird. The matte plastic is cool I guess. Don't expect much though, since they're super cheap."
2.0,"Order a full size up...  They are small!  Not just tight...  I can't even get them on.  For the price, they're not horrible, but fairly cheaply made."
2.0,Velcro doesn’t stick after several wears. My sons feet will unlock the Velcro after a few steps.
2.0,Only 2/3 of the lights worked.
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  Cheap, looks like a bubble gum machine necklace.  Cheap, flimsy chain.  I had got this for my grandaughter and hoped it would be half way decent."
2.0,Nice looking. Came with a watch tool which was nice. Unfortunately one of the safety bands was broken when it was packed (?). Hope the band lasts
2.0,"Ordered small since described as a loose swing style, but way too loose for me! Green color was very nice, but velvet light weight and kind of shapeless. I’m 5.5, 135 pds and perhaps an xs would be less excess fabric, but xs wasn’t as option for ordering. I returned this dress but it was pretty, well made, and if you don’t want to create any shape at all, it would be a pretty holiday dress!"
2.0,paid $8.00<br /><br />expected more<br /><br />shirt is good quality but sleeve length is very short.<br />only way i can wear is to have sleeves rolled up to elbow<br /><br />would only recommend to disproportionate short armed people
2.0,Dress extremely thin!
2.0,"Delivery was expedient.  However, definitely not what I expected per the picture; was very disappointed."
2.0,Runs super small. I hate returns!
2.0,This dress is extremely long<br />My daughter is normally wears a medium but this one almost went to her ankles we ordered a small and it fits tighter and has the length we were looking for just past knees<br />I missed the return window so now I have both dresses
2.0,missing stones
2.0,These were sooo cute BUT they got scuffed majorly after two wears to daycare. Cheap quality.
2.0,"It was good at first, but it got more and more loose until one day the gotcha was gone :("
2.0,Belt is not long enough.
2.0,First of all I am 5'4 and about 190 and I am a 36C. The length was fine though it was a bit tight across the bust . I think it is made from a cotton blend that is a bit rough. I was disappointed that it wasn't softer and I just couldn't see myself dragging this over my head after a hot day at the beach.  I had ordered a couple of similar dresses for less from different manufacturers and they were soft and draped well.
2.0,"Cute, but too small to carry all my stuff to the pool or the beach."
2.0,"Looks nothing like the photo. See-through. Poor quality and splotchy. Not long, at all, even after ordering an XL (I usuallr wear a medium.) ... the only reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 is because I salvaged it and gave it to my mom- who likes it. Only because she wasn't disappointed in ordering one thing and receiving something different."
2.0,"the leather is nice, however thin, and the metal accents are loose, and one is nearly falling off upon delivery."
2.0,"It’s really big - like sloppy big.  The print is not attractive, and the material is kind of stiff and scratchy.  Just not a good buy!"
2.0,Very hard to put on. Wasn't impressed.  But it's pretty.
2.0,Customer service never communicated with me. Very disappointed in this product and seller!
2.0,This watch looks great and my son really likes it but unfortunately the crown broke off the second time we needed to adjust the time and date and now we can’t adjust date or time anymore.  I’ll just chalk it up to buying a cheap watch.
2.0,Very fun colors and patterns. Way too tight in the calves.
2.0,These ratings are way to big!!!
2.0,Way to small & very long. Did not like the fit
2.0,"I'm pretty disappointed. This had such rave reviews. After waiting a month for my product to get here, I'm still going to have to double up. I used the size chart provided. They fit, they just don't support my girls the way I was expecting based on everything I read."
2.0,"item came with one lens popped out, and with a long crack down the middle the glasses are also very very wide. These are great if you have a giant head."
2.0,I bought the largest size available and it still didn't fit.  Definitely not US sizes so be very careful.  Luckily it was free returns so no harm no foul.
2.0,"Sizing is way off.  The 3D effect is not really as it appears in the picture, but still a cool design.  The material is not for ""all day comfort"" as advertised."
2.0,The color was different then shown in picture. The nose bridge was offset. Didn't fit well.
2.0,"En la imagen se veía diferente pero no son cómodas, me vino con un filo en medio de los dedos y tuve q meterle tijera para q no me moleste"
2.0,Looked like a nice shirt but have no idea what size to order.
2.0,"Ridiculously hard to clean. Not a fan, used once and never used again."
2.0,"didn't meet expectations, equivalent to quality from the street stands in NYC"
2.0,They're very pretty but after a month or so of keeping them in my jewelry box I noticed they turned brown and rusty. NO need in cleaning them I just threw them away
2.0,Bracelet broke right away
2.0,"Looked good, price is cheap, but it doesn't last at all, leather was splitting and cracking from like day 1, in a little under 6 months it broke."
2.0,"Uncomfortable on the ears. Those loops are way too tiny and far back. The back strap only stays on because I have my hair in a pony tail, but it isn’t comfortable. Three of the four had a nose bridge. One was missing. Sending back due to weird fit."
2.0,I picked a large and i wear medium and it's still not fit
2.0,"It's so much smaller than it looks, it doesn't wrap around my wrist comfortably and I have small wrists.  The picture is giant in comparison to the real thing!"
2.0,This is a nice band. I ordered GRAY and it is a black as it can be. My real issue is the maximum size of the band. It will not fit over my hand without removing the magnet end of he strap. this raises the risk of dropping the watch to unacceptable levels. Otherwise its a nice watchband.
2.0,It looks great on the model. but on me looks like a bad coat xxl and still looked weird.
2.0,Used this dress as a bridesmaids dress. I ordered the size I typically would wear and it was way too tight in the chest. I tried to order a different size in time for the wedding and it was unavailable on Amazon prime. I had to have the dress altered in order for it to work. The dress is beautiful but runs extremely small and extremely long.
2.0,"I’ve had the bras for about 2 months and the underwire is already coming out. I thought the bras were great quality when I got them but after one wash, the underwire in the bra started coming out."
2.0,"This looks ridiculous! The troopers look like sad melted trooper or something like that.<br />The rest of the patch looks fine, but the main image seriously looks ridiculous."
2.0,The diameter of each part of the ring was as small as advertised but where it all joined together was too large to fit through my dog’s id tag. Also the ring is not easily opened to put your items on the ring. It may work better if someone had something with a larger hole but that’s still not going to make it easier to use.
2.0,Runs too big....
2.0,"Based on it's price and the fact that it was only sold as a single I figured it was 3-dimensional. Turns out it was just a flat sticker on the front of the plug. That makes it a pretty cheap, uninteresting piece of jewelry to me. The plug the sticker is adhered to is of good sturdy quality, but who cares, since there's a sticker on the front of it.<br /><br />When ordering I was annoyed that they only offer singles, which means the face can only face one way, so even if you bought two they can't be worn as a pair (they should both face forward if worn in as a pair). If it's just a sticker there's no reason the image couldn't be made in reverse as well."
2.0,The pants were way to big! They came up to my boobs! The top was cute and fit great!
2.0,Fabric extremely chintzy. On the front of the sweater is a glaring mistake in the knit.<br />If I were looking to buy this in a store I would throw it an irregular sale bin
2.0,A little wide. Fall off my ears
2.0,Beautiful bathing suit but it was small in the bust area. Make sure to measure correctly and get correct size. Otherwise awesome.
2.0,Looks just like the picture but it came way too big. I got a small thinking it would fit me According to the size guide and it fits like a large. Very upset because it was for a Halloween costume and now I don’t think it’s going to look good.
2.0,Doesn’t fit right. I am sending it back.
2.0,While I really like this it came to me with two staples on the cardboard piece. I removed them carefully. You can still see the holes and it is snagged. I’m a little disappointed.
2.0,Material is cheap ..shows every line of panties ..not worth the price
2.0,"I had purchased this brand in the past so I ordered the same size.  When the pants arrived, the price tag was in British pounds and the sizing on the package was actually based on European sizing which was 2 sizes too small for me.  In reviewing the description again on Amazon, no where did it mention that the sizes listed were European.  Very disappointed.  Had to go through the hassle of returning and paying shipping charges.  Will be extremely careful in placing clothing orders in the future."
2.0,"If you are top heavy do not buy this swimsuit! The bottoms fit very well but the tops are so small. I am a size 12 so I ordered the XXL and the top fit like a C cup, mind you I am DD cup. Very disappointed! On a better not the quality of the suit was awesome and the color was gorgeous."
2.0,Earings are quite nice but the backs are very flimsy and one fell off almost losing me my earing.
2.0,Horrible! Super cheap material fits big.
2.0,"These are not compression shirts. As a t-shirt they are good, but there is no compression occurring when you have these in. I even ordered a size smaller than I normally wear."
2.0,Tiny horn with rotten shoestring for strap
2.0,I love them the only thing is that they are uneven and one side is closer to my face then the other side. I am going to use a blow dryer and try to fix it.
2.0,The colors and vibrancy is not as good in person as it is in the picture.
2.0,I was influenced to buy these off of Instagram for my hospital bag for delivery of my daughter. They are soft and the buttons are easy for nursing (I guess - I felt it was more a hassle to unbutton them). Shrinks in the wash - even following laundering guidelines on tags - and were a little small to begin with. I ordered a medium for my postpartum body of 150 pounds and 5’6”
2.0,"These shades are excallent quality but unfortunately are advertised as Polarized only, but are also ""Mirrored"". I wanted a blue lens, not a Mirrored blue on outside of lens only."
2.0,This hat is ok but not great! It's sheer and was bent on one side of the brim!! Not what I expected but you get what you pay for!! Price was Too good to be true!!
2.0,Third time I washed my hands fogged up can't see not happy
2.0,Adorable but not true to size had to give it away as It fits a kid
2.0,Leather not soft at all
2.0,"I liked how soft these feel inside and outside, but I could not find a pair that fit me, despite using the size guide.  I bought one pair (then returned them), then bought three more pairs (going up one size each time).  I gave up trying to buy these after 3-4 pairs did not fit me."
2.0,Tight around the toe area and I purchased a larger size than I actually wear.  The material is absolutely soft to the touch.  Bottom of the slipper is the hard plastic or rubber that I don't particularly like wearing on my no wax kitchen floor. I gave it a 2 because its soft.
2.0,band felt weird... broke with in 2 weeks of wearing it. keeps time great though
2.0,The stone is not very pretty. It's more of a translucent orange. These are small and look cheap.
2.0,"Cant stand when companies use photos that aren’t even there’s to market. I knew it was going to be risky purchasing this item but since I can return it(which is what I did), I decided to take the risk. And of course as expected, it’s not like the picture. For sure is bright orange. Not the color shown in the picture. Don’t waste your time! Definitely overpriced as well."
2.0,"Good Purse, I like it except for the Lock jams up. Gets stuck, I can't get it unlocked at all now😔"
2.0,The material is super thin and it's so big it doesn't stay on my face. It slides off as soon as I pull it up. The design is really low as well. Do not recommend.  Only gave two stars because of the Umbrella corporation logo.
2.0,"The ring looked beautiful in the pictures, so I took a chance and bought it even though it's on the more expensive side. When I received it, however, I was so disappointed by how low-quality the ring was. The band felt incredibly cheap and poorly made. There was no weight to the band. The ring also was much smaller than anticipated. They did send a free ring with the purchase which was nice, but the free ring did not fit my size 7 finger which is what I ordered. I ended up returning my purchase. For almost $30, I expected much higher quality than what was received."
2.0,Um yeah 3x...um 3x love the dress but yeah runs small
2.0,"The white words came off rather quickly after a day of use, tried to hand wash the bag and then most of the words have come out. Also smaller than I thought it would be."
2.0,They are very small.  Much smaller than the picture shown.  I don't think I will order you again.
2.0,"TH Rezin was better quality, but not available in my size. I ordered these thinking they were close to same. NOT...These are not as good. Faux suede in back and the buckle is plastic.  Donating to charity and going with something else."
2.0,Much smaller than described.
2.0,"Overall I’m disappointed. I was excited to find a bikini top with an underwire (I only wanted it for the top and did not try on the bottom). My first impression of it was that it seemed a little flimsy. With trying it on I found that it  did not fit how I expected it to and had  little support. I am not well endowed in the chest area. I wear a 34B, sometimes C. I ordered a medium. I felt that the top smooshed the area down, pushing it up at the top and squeezing it out at the bottom (I tried to show that in the picture). I would be afraid to wear it if I were planning to do any physical activity in fear that it would not stay in place. Maybe in the best of all possible worlds where I have perfect perky breasts it would work. I ended up returning it."
2.0,The earring back I have already lost.  It was very loose from the beginning.  The backs should be made better
2.0,I mean the material is nice....<br />But their ridiculously long. And the skull type ones you can't even tell because the designs sooooo big it wraps around your head
2.0,Soft and warm but way too big...I wear a size 6 shoe and the socks are at least 2 inches too big.  I like the length but they don't have enough stretch to stay up.
2.0,The strap broke within 2 weeks of use
2.0,Looks absolutely nothing like photo in ad! This is the 4th bead I've returned from this company for this same reason. I will not be ordering from this company anymore. Buyer beware. You will not get what you see.
2.0,"Terrible. Barely even tinted. A waste of money. If you like dark shades, these are not for you."
2.0,"These bras fit some what oddly & you have to wear the straps so tight to keep the top of the bra up. I am not happy with this purchase. I wear a 38 DD in so many different brands, however this brand fits very small."
2.0,"It's cute, but not the right color, more of a brown/yellow than the standard mustard we see, and the sizing in the chest is small."
2.0,Very disappointed. I thought these were a little tiny machines. It’s a plastic cut out. Cute but disappointing
2.0,"The quality of this product is terrible. The seams are coming apart all over. The string to tie it isn't coming out of the other side. It's really short! I'm only 4'11"" and it doesn't quite go to my ankles. The hoops are adjustable or removable so I'm rigging it up so I can use it because it does hold my dress out so I don't step on it. I had to sew ribbon on to tie it up and I'm thinking about using duct tape around the hoops to make sure they don't rip out..."
2.0,Not my style. Looks like I'm attending a funeral. Unflattering top
2.0,I bought these for my 7 year old daughter and she just thought they were ok. She wore them and they hurt her ears after a few days. Normally she can keep any size earring in for at least a week without any pain or discomfort. And they are extremely tiny from what I thought they would be.
2.0,Very thin and cheap material. Fit very short. Ended up returning it. You get what you pay for sometimes.
2.0,"Was an awesome gift, my brother enjoyed his present for ~1 month. The glasses lost all coating and are now just ugly, mildly transparent plastic wayfarers. Not worth the money due to poor quality."
2.0,"The Stadia controller fits snugly in the walls of the case. The problem with this case is that the pocket/netting on the top half puts pressure down on the thumbsticks, clicking them down. Unfortunately, I'll be returning this and waiting for a better option."
2.0,No give in the material. Very ridged.  Fit awkwardly. Course texture as well.
2.0,Wish I has 2 left and 2 right.
2.0,Too small inside for glasses
2.0,"Low quality, not well made"
2.0,came in darker than photo. wanted the lighter shade
2.0,Super cute but small on calves
2.0,"Although I have purchased a similar Jostar tank dress, this one was cut a tad smaller.  Loved the fabric and pattern but the cut was slightly smaller."
2.0,"Nice looking boots, but were too tight.  I usually wear a 7 in Vionic but these were too snug through the widest part of my foot.  They were also hard to get on because they lack a zipper."
2.0,"I like the fit, as well as the construction. But, the bill looks silly, and I probably will only wear it around the house. With a normal bill; about an inch shorter, I'd give it 5 stars."
2.0,"Too short, the metal bent the fifth time I used it in my shoe.  I should've gotten the taller, more resilient, cheaper one from Ikea."
2.0,"My shirt is not like the one in the photo. I bought the &#34;dark gray&#34; but it isn't gray at all. It's more like a dark blue color, which is completely fine. It looks blue in the photo. I just wanted to mention that. The colors are about the only thing I like on this shirt. The sleeves are short and weird looking, I think because the material is just too thick. Instead of it looking rounded on the bottom of the front and back of the shirt, it has extra material on the sides of the shirt and flares out. I guess I got what I paid for."
2.0,"Really like but the grey has holes in it so I'm returning them. I don't think I'll order them again because the fabric is so thin, I don't trust the quality."
2.0,the material was more like long johns. was not very stylish in person
2.0,"Shoes are really cute, but poorly made. The Batteries needed replaced after about 3 days and I count get all the lights to work once I changed the batteries. The insert is super thin and the shoe is totally for looks. The bow fell off after 1week of wear."
2.0,"First thing I noticed...  This comes in an envelope... I expected that the package would be a bit bulkier. I opened the envelope, and the shirt (I can't call it a sweatshirt, I'll get to that in a moment) was vacuum-sealed. Never received a shirt like that before. I thought, well, they must've used a lot of vacuum to get it so small, maybe it'll ""poof"" out after opening... Nope.  Material is very very thin (think t-shirt, maybe slightly thicker)  See pic, you can read the laptop screen through the material. So I can't call it a sweatshirt, because I can't see how it can ever make anyone sweat.<br /><br />Next point.  This shirt is really small sized. I bought a large (and neglected to read the fine print that says it uses China sizes, shame on me). Definitely not an American size large. I actually measured the shirt against their provided size chart, and the measurements were actually smaller than their chart anyways.<br /><br />Third point: Quality is suspect. Loose strings. Only one end of drawstring is coated.<br /><br />This would maybe make a decent shirt for a slightly cool day. Not really a shirt to keep you warm when you want to bundle up.<br /><br />I love the little heart design. But that doesn't overcome my disappointment in this purchase. I will be returning this not-a-sweatshirt."
2.0,This is very tinny. Not the jewelry I was looking for.
2.0,"These are not really towels in the traditional sense. I mean, yeah, they'll dry you off, but they don't look or feel like towels. They're more similar to micro fiber towels to dry off cars than bath towels."
2.0,"The design is nice however, it is skin-tight even wearing Spanx and will show every bulge.  If that doesn't bother you, than go for it but personally, I do like the skin tight look unless you don't have a lot to  camouflage.  I am 5'7 slim legs & Hips but a bigger tummy, and weigh 190.  Not that big of a deal except the material for this dress is wrong for larger women because it has stretch spandex in it and that means it will cling to everything.  Color was fine just did not like that it stuck like glue on my body.  If it were a different material, it would be a keeper for me but it's not and I will be returning it."
2.0,After reading the reviews I was excited about ordering the dress but when I received I was disappointed that the dress was too small! I recommend you order a size up!
2.0,"I guess for $4 it's..fine. Fabric is very flimsy, and one of my clasp buttons is defective. I'm really not impressed. You get what you pay for I suppose. :/<br />Will read reviews next time."
2.0,keeping in hopes I'll lose enough to make it more comfy. was going to return but xmas got in the way
2.0,"If you order this, order at least 3 sizes bigger. I ordered a 3X and it barely fits a girl who wears a size 16."
2.0,It was not what I expected a little more to fancy for me
2.0,"I ordered it by the sizing chart, it arrived way too big. Quality looked fine, disappointed it didn't fit."
2.0,I absolutely loved the style of this bracelet.<br />However the links and clasp are made of plastic or an extremely cheap metal. Mine got caught on my jacket button and snapped like it was made of straw.
2.0,This is suppose to be shock proof and mine now has a crack in it from dropping it one time by accident and then it causes your phone to echo and most people cant hear you. I have to use a headset just to talk on it.
2.0,They look good and have pretty good polarization but they don’t fit quite right in my frames. My glasses are Costa permit; the model they’re supposed to be made for.
2.0,My son kept​ it but he does not wear it much. It is too short.
2.0,Poorly made. Made out of cheap fabric and you cant adjust the suspenders.
2.0,Unfortunately it looked pretty cheap.  Fell of constantly.  Been lost since the first week i got it.
2.0,"This is very nice fabric, but way too much fabric in the front.  I'm 130# and bought the small and it could be wrapped around me like a blanket.  With all the excess fabric, it makes even a slim figure look like a pear."
2.0,Way to small ...
2.0,It said doesn’t do Fog ! But it dose<br />Also! It has a scratch on it
2.0,Totally see through and rides up. Not really what I was looking for.
2.0,"The material is thick and soft but its cut very odd.  The sleeves are fine in length but its tight in the arm pits.  The length is VERY short!  Width is fine.  If it were longer and and more room in the armpits, it would be a favorite."
2.0,"Bands great, except for the slots for the pins. They broke after less than a month of wearing the band. Normal everyday wear, no water, no strenuous activity, just snapped in half one day. Then when changing it the other side broke."
2.0,"The top was too big, the strap hooks were broken. The bottoms were a little snug. I won't be using the top at all. I might get to wear the bottoms."
2.0,Cute and very lightweight.  Fishhooks are way to straight so require rubber stopper otherwise they fall out all day
2.0,Run gigantic.
2.0,The top fit.  The bottom did not.
2.0,Not real happy with the way pearls were attached to metal drop.
2.0,"Looks like a quality product, but if you have larger wrists, don't bother."
2.0,The zipper is not holding up as expected.  I like the jacket's fit and style but have only worn once and having trouble with the zipper.
2.0,"Disappointed. These are cute, but I can't for the life of me get them open to wear them..."
2.0,"After a year, the metal case fell off, and the interior fanfold card holder fell out. Now it's just a plastic wallet. I don't recommend this product."
2.0,The low review is because the dress while advertised as a large seemed to be a little off. So definitely go a size bigger
2.0,"My daughter LOVES them. They fit as expected and don’t seem to rub/pinch. Unfortunately, they’re also not durable. Pictures incuded are after just one week of regular wear."
2.0,Just weird. Don't like how it feels on my skin.
2.0,"Maybe I messed up the sizing but the dress was way too large and baggy. I was expecting a slimmer fit like the model in the picture, but the dress is quite wide, stretchy and baggy and basically looks like a witch's dress on me."
2.0,"I was a bit skeptical that this ring is truly stainless steel, I highly doubt it is unless it is a very low grade SS.  It is magnetic, most decent SS such as 420 or 440 is non magnetic.  It glows ok for a short time after being exposed to bright light.  I personally wouldn't have paid $9 for this ring, I had bought one that was like $2 direct from CHINA but it never showed up.  I had high hopes for this ring and while it looks good, I have doubts it is going to hold up to any long term wear."
2.0,"Does not provide much compression. I bought two different kids at the same time and the other ones were much better, these are just OK, but they are warmer, so if you just want some support but want some socks that are soft and warmer than your typical compression socks then these are OK, but if you want true compression style socks I wouldn't recommend these."
2.0,"Bought this as a cheap watch to give away. The watch itself is nice looking, with large numerals on it.  That part is worth the price. Unfortunately the band came with a lost buckle.  Also, the band is made of some sort of really cheap leather imitation, and doesn't feel good. With a better band, maybe silicone, this could be a very nice cheap watch. The design is cute."
2.0,small and had hole in side that was not connected
2.0,Too hot to wear for summer.
2.0,"Poor quality, high price for these handkerchiefs.  Good men's handkerchiefs, not the ornamental kind, are hard to find.  I do not recommend these."
2.0,Cheaply made. One of the straps came off after a few times wearing it. Really disappointing.
2.0,It's nice for someone who likes large handbags
2.0,"This band is super cute but the pins aren't long enough for my Fitbit Versa 2. I had to replace them with the pins from one of my other bands. In order to do this, I had to put a slit in the band which has compromised the integrity of the band. Hopefully it'll last through the season."
2.0,"too large, not shapely"
2.0,RETURNED item.
2.0,Puppy was too long or I ordered wrong size
2.0,They weren't the shades from the picture showed. They are similar but the ones on the picture are the ones I wanted. I got the normal dark shades I like the super dark one.
2.0,I was disappointed because it arrived with a 2 mesh scratched in the chest area. Must be from packaging because there’s sequins next to it.<br />The dress is long and I found another fabric run on the back of the dress .<br />Otherwise it would have  been a beautiful dress to wear to a wedding just had to return it as it was pretty obvious scratched.
2.0,"From third week of use the lining started to fall apart and the filling started to show off from the slipper . The size is little to short, the end of my feet keeps bumping the plastic end of the slipper . Its still a cute slipper , comfy and warm, but you will change it within first 2 months of us"
2.0,Very disappointed. Been looking for a 24-7 wear toe ring and anklet and based on the description thought this would be it. It wasn't. The silver coating wore off after about 6 weeks of daily wear.
2.0,The crown is amazingly beautiful but the red isn't red it's more of a coral color. That is why I gave it 2 stars. But it is really breath taking and beautiful. It the color was red it would be 5 stars.
2.0,The color was amazing and the quality was great. If it wasn't so wide would have been the perfect product.
2.0,"This 100% does not fit a Samsung Galaxy J7. I have to stretch it so tight around the phone just to get it on. It looks like it will pop off any second. It makes the power button on the side nearly unusable and blocks half the rear facing camera. I will give it 2 stars because it is absolutely adorable, I just really wish it fit my phone. On another note, it does have a really funky smell."
2.0,Looks like aluminum.
2.0,Second time I've attempted to purchase this Item. The first time was from a different seller which I never ended up receiving. Now this is the second time (first time from this seller) which I actually received. These are my finding on this product from this seller !!<br /><br />The shirt would not even qualify as a scoop or boat neck let alone an off the shoulder !!  The waste band of the shorts are wider than the neck is ... The good thing about this product was that the fabric and the quality was very nice!!  It is a shame that I will be having to return it !!!  Was and Is not as shown and or as advertised !!
2.0,"Generally love Verdusa dresses but this one is poorer quality than the others I have. It has a slight sheen to the material and is a bit stiff even after washing. The dress does not hang on the body like the picture. It also has a very awkward and unflattering cut. The front, if you can find it puckers beginning below the knee."
2.0,Poorly made. I had to cut a lot of the strings away  from the ends when I wore it the first time. After a few wears it has a hole in the arm. A cute sweater idea but poorly made. I also purchased this in grey and the arms are extremely tight.
2.0,The dress was see-through.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:b8f53ea03a27c79e2e7f079dc6ce4aa0]] The diamonds started falling off on the first day it’s so cute but it’s falling apart..
2.0,Supper thin glove and it takes forever to deliver.
2.0,It fit her good  in length but was tight on her in a few places. Also the button on her overalls broke off the 2nd time wearing them.
2.0,Cheap thin n flimsy for readers. Wouldn’t even fit on his face right. Definitely sized wrong and not returnable. Smh. Waste of money.
2.0,I first bought a small because my daughter is a small size 4. She could not get the small on. They were so short and very tight on the leg. There was no way she could zip them up.  I ordered a med and a large to try because waterproof pants are required for a camp she is attending. The large arrived first so she tried them before the med. she is 5' 7&#34; and these barley skim the top of her shoes. They are baggie in the waist but there is no way she would be able to fit in the med. comfortably. These seem to be good stylish waterproof pants but order a larger size.
2.0,"Pienso que el producto cumple con su objetivo, pero es demasiado grande, mi hijo tiene 10 años y es demasiado grande para él."
2.0,The mask is too heavy. This causes it to sag on the face. It's unusable for me.
2.0,"These ran small, too small, I didn’t get to use them. I bought them pre birth and so after birth it was too late to return them. Disappointed."
2.0,The color contrast was not what I expected.
2.0,dress had holes in it upon purchase.  had to sew up before wear.
2.0,I loved the way the dress looked in the picture but in real life it's not that cute. The material is really cheap and that combined with the print makes it look like a night gown. It may look better on someone else but it was a hard pass for me. I'll be returning it.
2.0,"Nice looking, but very heavy. My piercings are less than a year old though, so might feel better when my piercings are more healed"
2.0,This is the second coat I have tried from Amazon it is okay but both me and my husband got the same coat and they are both tight in the arm and shoulder area. The coats we got before were sent back defective so far just not impressed with the clothes I have purchased seems like they are defective or run off on sizes and weird fabrics hummm. My really old Columbia coat seems to be made better really heavy duty and had style.
2.0,The product runs small and when we tried to return it we had to pay shipping — to China which was more expensive than the actual item so we are stuck with an outfit that doesn’t fit anyone
2.0,Low quality and does not hold bigger watches well.
2.0,"Pretty, but HUGE!  And I purchased the small one.  Not worth the exorbitant shipping to return it."
2.0,"Not sturdy, can tear very easily. One time use."
2.0,"The material is extremely thin and fragile feeling. It looks like the picture only much, much thinner. Probably would not recommend this to anyone."
2.0,"They are a little too big in scale for me as far as appearance, and also they won't stay on my ears"
2.0,"Cute boots, just too tight on my wide feet. I definitely have to return them. They fit great on my calf, but with or without the liners I bought, they are tight."
2.0,I am very disappointed in the quality of the fabric.  It is very thin and the inside is rough.  I did like the fit.  It will be returned.
2.0,The fabric is really thin and you can see right through it. A risk you take buying online I guess. Returned the dress.
2.0,Suuuuuuper small on me
2.0,"The shorts were cute! The top however, was really cheaply made and was way too large...and I'm a DD! I cannot wear it, sadly. I am still using the shorts for pajamas.<br /><br />The trim in the photos appeared to be a much more delicate lacy fabric, but the trim in person is more like a fine crochet/lace. Still cute, but not what I wanted."
2.0,The charm tarnished it turned like a copper color
2.0,"Verrrrry thin fabric, but still very cute and fashionable. I got an XL ( my normal is medium or large depending) and this was still pretty tight. It will work tho"
2.0,"I ordered an XL and for the most part, fit as expected. I thought there would've been more body shaping material, more heavyweight material. However, it's lightweight, almost like a cotton blend t-shirt."
2.0,"Definitely runs smaller than size chart indicates. Also, not sure what I was expecting, but the graphic is nothing more than an iron on decal.  Very cheap looking.  The seller did work with me on a return so that was helpful."
2.0,Came broken. I had to fix it
2.0,I had it on for 5 min and it broke at the part that holds the metal leaf :((
2.0,several of the leather straps were broke when I got it...I'm going to try the shoe repair shop. Oh well....
2.0,Not crazy about how it looks on.
2.0,Way too big for me. Sad
2.0,"Not sturdy at all, the wind broke it a few times, I glued it and still keeps coming off. When the sun hits it it looses its color on the outward side. Only good while it lasted"
2.0,"although very stylish, this shoe did not work for me."
2.0,Way too tiny and I got the largest option. Otherwise it was really cute. :(
2.0,Poor quality and shed everywhere.
2.0,bad  smell left outside 4 days may return  no information company
2.0,"cheap material, feels like a thin canvas, wrinkles terribly"
2.0,Love the look and polarization but arm broke off after a few weeks.
2.0,Too small. Needed a lining. Returned.
2.0,Missing the flap shown in picture. Material is definitely not leather as advertised.
2.0,"Cute but two of the sets are messed up. One the backing is too loose to have the earring stay hooked, the other backing doesn't open to release the part you put into your ear.<br /><br />I will be returning these."
2.0,"Ordered two belts 6 months ago, one black and one brown. Had been using reversible belts but they didn't last. Thought that these belts would cost most and last longer. Today the loop that holds the belt end fell off. The leather holding the loop tore in half. The belt is still usable if you slide the belt loop onto the belt before you buckle it. Inspected the black belt and it still looks good. I liked these belts and may order a replacement but will wait to see if the other belt fails as well. Belts have held up well otherwise."
2.0,Only came with one pair of gloves
2.0,The filter part is white but I’m going to keep them. Won’t buy again
2.0,Product was absolutely wonderful....for a month. Then a link in the band broke and started to scratch my wrist but also got caught in several items of clothes and caused pulls and tears. Currently having to order a different type of band since this one has become jagged and sharp.
2.0,The band rusted right away and made my wrist turn green when I would wear it.
2.0,"The fit was fine but after the wash, the cotton fabric turned into a wrinkled mess that was impossible to unwrinkle. I have had many cotton hats but in this one the shrinkage was extreme."
2.0,"Terrible product, cheap, see through, not even normal legging length. Shipping took forever."
2.0,"Really cheap looking and very shiny, not the matte in picture."
2.0,The shirt online looks vibrant and ended up being super dark and hard to recognize.
2.0,Ordered plus size and it was too small and the material is pretty thin. Nice color though.
2.0,Super cute but the medium would fit my 7 year old who is in small right now. She needs an extra large in this shirt for it to fit right.
2.0,The Quality is quite nice but about 70% of it was brown and tan hardly woodland I'll be seeing about getting my money back
2.0,"I guess this would be fine if you like to change up your watch band all the time and weren't wearing it all the time. For me, I've been wearing it every day, and one of the little bands that holds the strap down has already broken, and I bought it 5 months ago. So that's disappointing. Other than that, the color is great, and it's comfortable, and easy to put on."
2.0,"Have had two pairs of these and the rubber nose piece and the arm ends start to breakdown and come apart after a few months of wearing on the job. I enjoy the fit and function of them, just wish they lasted longer."
2.0,"This is cute, but is scratched and looks used."
2.0,I’m a 38C I got a medium and it fit great on the arms. The boob area was a nightmare it kept slipping down and boobs kept spilling out
2.0,"Honestly I don't know what I was expecting, but this is not it.<br /><br />This is not flattering at all, it fits all weird, those white stripes sit awkwardly and the skirt lifts up way too high and you can see the shorts underneath it. The fabric just doesn't sit right at all, just weird. Don't waste your money."
2.0,It broke pretty fast I love the color I love how it looks next to my watch as well. But not long lasting.
2.0,The dress is cute and stretchy. It is definitely not the right colors. The bottom that should be yellow is a florescent green. Disappointed in the color for sure!
2.0,"These look great.  And I really like the design.  However, they broke on their very first flight.  I couldn't be more disappointed in the performance of these.  Did not hold up.  Wheel broke during normal handling.  These look great but don't waste your money."
2.0,"Good lenses, but the frame broke in half the second day I had them"
2.0,So super small!<br />I bought 5x.. normally I am between xl and xxl my gosh this fits like a large!
2.0,"bad quality, sent back"
2.0,"Pretty cheap kept them but do not use. These are light and not the best looking, either am I but with these on it doesnt help"
2.0,I will have to agree with the other 2 reviews that it is a coarse / rough material. It is not smooth / silky or even cotton/polyester  like  but rubs against your skin like plastic mesh. it wont cover your  entire backside  and provide enough support if you have a decent sized one.
2.0,fits way smaller than stated size; cost as much to return dress as paid for.  make sure you order the correct size or size up a couple sizes
2.0,"It's super cute, but broke the first time I wore it. But for the price, what do you expect."
2.0,The pearls were more of a dark green color than black.
2.0,"This dress fit pretty true to size and very cute BUT it is VERY see through, the material is very thin, when I took it out of the package and held it up too look at it I could see through the entire dress, NOT satisfied with this purchase at all. Then I had to pay to return it not right!!!"
2.0,Came with some flaws in the wood and paint. Pen which was included worked well.
2.0,Es una tela demasiado fina y te transparenta... solo sirve para estar en casa...
2.0,"Quality was good , however item is advertised as &#34; Toddler Boy &#34; yet was made using a female style shirt with label ( in reference to material and collar ) ."
2.0,bad manufacturin
2.0,"Returned this.  The size chart is totally wrong.  I bought an Large based on my body measurements matched with the chart.  It was at least 2 sizes too big.  Pretty design but material came highly wrinkled like it had been wadded in a small ball.  If meant to be that way, it looks messy."
2.0,"If your face is very flat, these may fit, not much curve.  Plastic with spring temples."
2.0,"Not good they only lasted 6 days of skiing, they kept my hands warms when they were good"
2.0,Not really waterproof.... worn them several times in rain and each time soggy socks
2.0,I got the smallest size and it was still too big for me. It would always move on my wrist and would lock. I hade to buy I knew band shortly after getting this one because it just wasn’t working out for me
2.0,"I'm 5'5 curvy woman, it was too short for it it seemed I had to pull and stretch it to fit, I got XL TO fit my curves, it was a little too wide just not lengthy. Two sizes small on height."
2.0,"Like the color and design but it doesn't work. The magnet is weak and regardless of where I place it, it falls out. I am disappointed in the product"
2.0,Disappointed that it is not as pictured and fastens in an odd way.
2.0,Fabric seemed cheap and the button on the shoulder was odd.
2.0,"I had these for a month and some of them fell apart, much less the most indistinct ones. They were great otherwise."
2.0,"Buyer beware!  I have ordered this dress in Navy L last week and loved it so much, that I ordered one in black and just received it!  To my surprise two dresses are not the same!  The cut and size are different, but mostly noticeable is the fabric itself. The navy one I got last week is made out of soft cotton material with a nice drape, the seams are well done with nice labels, the one I got today is shiny, made out of some synthetic clingy fabric, poor quality and label text rubbed off...and the smell.. the dress smells terrible.  It's supposed to be the same dress, same manufacturer and sold by the same company, but the quality is night and day. This thing is going back asap!"
2.0,Almost immediately the metal pieces around the lace holes popped out and didn't stay in reliably and now not quite two years out of these rain boots and they have completely come apart at the heel and are useless due to the complete separation. For the cost of these boots (priced at $148 when I bought them) I'd have really hoped they'd last more than two short rainy seasons. The soft faux fur lining was amazing and stayed soft - I never wanted to wear socks (also they were narrow so I couldn't wear socks anyway otherwise they caused awful rubbing on the heel). The look was unbeatable - super cute and I got tons of complements but I just really had higher hopes with the longevity of these boots. I would not buy again and would not recommend to a friend.
2.0,They looked great for a costume but broke within a few days
2.0,Have to change my review...one sock keeps sliding down...no matter what I do it keeps sliding down. A definite flaw in the sock!!!
2.0,"The print quality is lower than expected. The color is much brighter than on screen, and it makes the product look cheaper, along with the overly shiny fabric. I found similar products in a local 99c store for 3.99... I'm returning it."
2.0,"It's nice material, but didn't fit, I'm a 36DD and it was way to small."
2.0,Size up unless you want it to be skin tight.
2.0,It looks like a gorilla halloween costume. I wish there was something that could make it better. Hate it.
2.0,"I have huge hands. Like ring size 9+ hands.<br />And this fit me right out of the (plain cardboard) box.<br />It is adjustable, but to make it smaller, you have to squeeze & overlap the 2 sides of the metal band. The band appears to be glued on to the disk, so a lot of squeezing could pop it right off.<br />Assuming you can adjust to your right size, the decorated disk is really big - as in hits my knuckle big!<br />No idea how smaller fingers would wear this.<br /><br />Since it’s obviously a costume statement piece, I guess wearing it for a special occasion or with a special outfit might be doable, but I’ve worn it only long enough to type this review & it is annoying me. A lot.<br />A couple of stars for the pretty design is all I can do.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope it’s Helpful!)"
2.0,"I really liked them when I got them.  The fit was good and I liked the design, however, one of the arms broke off (at the metal part) in the cover in the eyeglass ""section"" of my purse."
2.0,I ordered several in different colors but wound up giving them away...I found them to be too tight around the hip area therefore defeating the purpose of the shirt being a &#34;peekaboo&#34; lace
2.0,It fit me in the button however the top was small like too short. I am tall I am 5'10 and it wouldn't even stretch to my shoulders .. disappointed because I was looking forward to this being my birthday outfit
2.0,It was nice just didn't fit the way I thought it would
2.0,Turns out to be super ugly and not a thing like the picture. The material was weird and not like the other 2 different colored ones I got from the same seller.
2.0,"Glasses size was advertised as 'extra large'.  Only way they will fit over my ladies regular glasses is by forcing them in, which is unsatisfactory.  Have purchased this brand at the optometrist with excellent results, however the sun glasses that I received were not the same.  No case and very 'cheap' looking and feeling.  NOT satisfied."
2.0,it was just to small
2.0,"Neck hole is too big.<br />Like a dress sweater that you want to wear a collared shirt under.<br />I ordered a Large and I checked it against an old made in USA Russell.<br />The neck hole is at least 50% bigger on this L than the USA made XL.<br />The sleeves are probably 3&#34; longer on this size L than on USA made size XL.<br />Who is the genius that made this pattern up? He or she should be fired.<br /><br />I have an assortment of USA made Russell, Hanes, Champion and Fruit of the Loom sweat shirts that are<br />15-20 years old and finally wearing out. None of these companies seem to know how to make the foreign<br />made stuff up to their old standards.<br />If someone knows of a company that can make sweat shirts like these old ones let me know because I can't find one.<br />I would be willing to pay more to get something like the old ones. What good is a bargain if it's so poorly made that you don't<br />even want to wear it.<br />I might wear this in the basement or donate it to Goodwill, won't wear this at work."
2.0,"The threads were stripped on one of cable's connector, making it useless. Not sure how much confidence I have with the other one. The rows in the label were raised making it a bit difficult to write."
2.0,Very poor quality. The fabric looked very cheap.
2.0,Marked X-Large but must be a youth size. Fits nobody in the family. Can't return because 'original packaging' (an envelope) was thrown out.  Will have to save it for my 4 year old grandson.
2.0,"Much smaller than I realized ,  got it for elderly parent. Should put a quarter next to the photo"
2.0,"eh, not terrible but the dress is not full enough, not flowy and has two slits in front which makes the front look weird."
2.0,Wayyyyy too much heel slip made these unwearable for me.
2.0,"The bracelets I bought were pretty and look like the picture. The problem is putting them on, very difficult even with 2 people! I bought them for friends and we struggled to get them on each of them. The clasp was the problem. There is no way to get it on by yourself, pity they are still pretty."
2.0,Sizing is bigger than your normal size
2.0,Only one I could find so I bought it. Chain is as cheap-looking as it appears in photo so I replaced it. Price wasn't too bad (around $12) but add $6 S & H and it's not worth it. Haven't decided yet about returning it since I found no replacement. I should have waited for one done in silver or silver plated.
2.0,Dad hat
2.0,"Very nice looking braceltes, but the thread connecting the parts is NOT elastic as you would expect. Thus, the bracelet is stiff and won't expand for ease of insertion and removal. It hardly fit my hand (and I wear medical gloves size Xsmall). I asked my mother to try it on (her hands are slightly bigger than mine) and the bracelet won't go half through. Two out of the three in the pack won't fit the larger-than-average hands of my children's teachers. Let's hope the skinny teacher likes her gift!"
2.0,Quick on and quick off with this band.  Which is the problem you bump your watch and the band’s quick release well releases. The band itself feels great but if it can stay on my wrist it is sort of pointless especially if you’re doing anything active.
2.0,The bracelets are not even made with soft thread. They are hard and the knots constantly come undone. The bracelets are also very big and become loose almost immediately after tightening. Don't waste your money on these.
2.0,"Boxy and baggy, especially in the front. Looked frumpy, the loose relaxed style in the picture is not what they look like on in person. The thighs are as wide as the crotch area."
2.0,When I received this product it was already broken. The handle was very cheap and when you pull the stem from the actual umbrella it doesn't lock out. I returned this immediately.
2.0,The dress is really cute! I love the material and the fact that it stretches. The only problem that I have is it is too short on me. I'm 5&#34;3 and I love to dress sexy/classy and I whipped this out for an All White Highschool Grad Party and was like hell NO! I probably should've ordered a bigger size and just got it sewn to fit the rest of me. lol
2.0,Cheaply made. No glitter on it. Does not look like photo
2.0,"Gorgeous boot, and I'd be d@mned if I couldn't wear them! I have muscular, 16/17 inch calves. I wear a size 6-8 pant... so I am muscle. Initially, I was able to zip them to just under my calves. I dumped  equal parts of rubbing alcohol and water into a spray bottle and saturated these beautiful boots, primarily from the inside ... Then I wore them all day, slowly zipping boot higher and higher, while adding socks/layers. After 7 hours I stopped saturating my boots and  after about 11 hours, I took off the layers, put on one pair of boot socks with my leggings , and the fully dried boots fit wonderfully. I wish the product description provided calf circumference! I wasn't about to return these nice looking boots though! I have to stretch more so I could wear with jeans."
2.0,"It would have been perfect, had the image not been distorted."
2.0,It looked nicer in the picture. Looks more like a nightgown.
2.0,Ordered a large but it's still too small
2.0,"I have no complaints other than that it smell of mildew. I guess that's a pretty big complaint, though, as I had wanted to wear it on my shoulder, but couldn't because of the odor."
2.0,"I'm giving this top 2 stars because it is pretty, but if it weren't for that it would be a 0. Bought a 2xl and it was SO small and very short in length. It felt more like a medium or even a small if you didn't want it so clingy. Very disappointed with this."
2.0,"I wear a men's 8.5 sneaker, generally get 9-11 size socks. Why they don't use the same measuring system is one of the mystery of the ages. Received size M of these compression socks, supposed to be in black color. Instead of black, it was a green striped pair. Would I ever order socks with green stripes? Nope. Tried the socks, and they are on the small side, and more than just a bit tight. So, for compression socks, they certainly compress, to the point of strangulation.<br />The socks are well made and feel like excellent socks. The elasticity is excellent, too. If it came in the proper coloring, and was a size larger, I think this could be a very effective pair of compression socks.<br />So, if you use my experience as a guide and get the right size, and happen to get the correct color, you'd probably be happy with this product."
2.0,Do not buy these clothes or those that say PRIME come factory faulty and AMAZON is not responsible only the customers are affected
2.0,"I am taller and so one piece suit never did do me right.  Also, the hook for the back was missing the part to hook it into."
2.0,EXPENSIVE!!!!!
2.0,"Dont get me wrong, this is a sturdy product.  But seems like its made for a 5 year old kid.  Its too small for me to want to use."
2.0,"Good belt, but out of no where the pins that hold the buckle to the belt fell out. Useless now. Disappointed."
2.0,Only good purpose is for taking the bag out on day trips or grocery shopping. Esp if you don’t want to carry your large hand bag
2.0,Disappointed with the product. Didn’t make a difference in the pain in my arm
2.0,"It kills my ankles, they’re very high in the back and it hurts"
2.0,Mine did not look like the picture.
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for in this situation. The necklace is sturdy and doesn’t pinch or pull hair, which is good.<br />I did not shower with this necklace but I did wear it every day. After a month it is now brown and all the ‘yellow’ gold is gone. Will be discarding"
2.0,Cheap very flimsy & light.
2.0,The frame will begin to peel plastic bits everywhere after about a year of low usage and if one of the lenses comes out of the frame it cannot be securely refastened.
2.0,will not fit a size 13.  they were advertised to fit 13 but feel more like a maximum of 12.
2.0,The bust on a lady needs to be larger for the shirt to fit as expected.
2.0,This necklace will not stay straight.  It twist up on your neck.
2.0,Not enough support in the bra area
2.0,I wanted to love this shirt. I ordered my true size and the fit was great except the arms were about 2 sizes too small. Too tight and uncomfortable so returned.
2.0,So when I went to swap the watch color the backs  stayed attached to the watch. I was able to put it back together but anytime you go to swap it out for another color the back comes off still. They won't stay together.
2.0,"So uncomfortable because of the scratchy fabric! Feels awful! I don’t know how this product got such high reviews, but maybe they changed the fabric? If you don’t have a perfectly flat stomach, the fabric will gather your fat and make you look pregnant. Maybe that’s just how seamless leggings are, I’m not sure since this is my first pair. Fit was fine, I ordered a size S and usually wear a size 4, I’m 5’3”, 118 lbs, and athletic/petite shape."
2.0,"Broke like a week later. Seemed cool tho, very plastic-y."
2.0,"Not the quality I expected for $56 dollars.  It is not a lovely full maxi skirt like the pictures.  It has these weird flaps sewn onto an awkward cut of skirt and ends up being a midi skirt, even on my 5'3"" frame.  The overall effect was pretty frumpy.  It looks like some sort of cheap, botched renfest dress.  I'm super disappointed, because the concept is cute."
2.0,These boots started off good plenty of support and fit well but after 1 year the shoes fell apart soles separated from the uppers.
2.0,"Very poor quality, it's cute but broke the first time it was worn."
2.0,Please don’t waste you money.  These are not worth $20.  I’ve found better quality sunglasses at the Dollar Tree! I was so excited get them until I unboxed them. I am so disappointed in the quality of them!
2.0,Boob portion fit but the body was so long
2.0,"Looks good from afar.. but if you or anyone else gets a close-up look at it, you will be severely disappointed. Very few of the stones sit correctly in their holders - some of them are nearly in there sideways. What makes it worse is that the exposed part of the stones that are supposed to be seated have chipping paint on the side of them instead of just the bare stone. If this is a gift for someone else, move along.. if it's for yourself, think twice."
2.0,"The hoodie looks good, nice graphics , 2x fits like a large so buyer beware."
2.0,"I got it to give my dad as a gift. Battery died after a week,"
2.0,"I liked the style and the way it looked, but the sewing on this was horrible, I washed once on a gentle cycle and the stitching start getting loose...Ever since I have had to hand wash it..."
2.0,"Went up a size in this top cause my other one was too snug.  Was too big and too long.  The point was all the way down to my knee.  The quality control for this top is not that good, I bought 3 of them and each one was different.  Thin material so if you don't want it see through, buy a dark color."
2.0,I am a medium and the large was way too small.  The fabric is a silky poly feel and not comfortable.  Will be returning.<br />I am bummed because the design is cute.
2.0,"The leather is more like a plastic.  Hard and stiff, not in a good way :)"
2.0,This Pendant is much bigger than you would think and looks a bit awkward underneath clothing. The bulbous lion at the top can been seen as a bump at the top of the chest. I wouldn't recommend this product for most people.
2.0,"Soft material, true to size, but poorly made.  Stitching is a mess.  Would expect it to start to unravel after a wash or two.  Oh well."
2.0,It smells alot like petroleum.
2.0,It was like it was for a doll. Had to return it
2.0,The design of the mask is more vivid and stands out more in the sample photo on Amazon. The mask itself is kinda blurry. The photo isn't really visible. Kinda disappointing for me as a MJ fan. The mask material is also too thick so breathing in mask is.very suffocating. Takes away my breath a little bit
2.0,"I opened it and it looks like a $19.99 bag to me. I bought the brown one. It looks very plasticky not leather. It feels plastic too. Plus there is a pretty strong polyurethane smell to it. For people who say they don’t smell anything, their nose might not be picking up scents well.<br /><br />The zippers do not look high quality. It may not look as cheap if they made it all black but the little brown accents just make it even cheaper. Even my cheap laptop bag I bought for $20 from FYY feels more substantial and leather like."
2.0,"The product was extremely bent when I received the package. A little disappointing, can't be too sad due to the price"
2.0,"Poor material, shows every flab"
2.0,It keep my hands warm but the the gloves started pilling within 2 weeks of usage. I don't think this gloves can last past a season. Also the touchscreen capability is intermittent and that what I bought the gloves for initially.
2.0,The first order was defective.  One of the turkey's had no eyes.
2.0,Only thing I like is the cute babydoll style and the color
2.0,The tank stringer itself fits well and is decent quality. Sadly the screen printing is pretty bad. It's the super thick kind I remember as a kid that leaves a sweat spot because it's so thick and hot and starts falling apart as you wear it. The cracks and separations you can see in my photo are after only one washing. If I didn't like Capt. America so much I'd have probably given it one star.
2.0,"This item gets two stars because it comes with no washing instructions. It seems as if it is sturdy enough to wash- kind of a thin cotton twill with spandex. Apparently it is ABSOLUTELY UNWASHABLE! It shredded in my washing machine on a gentle cycle (I have a front loader and they are fairly easy on clothing). It is now full of large-ish holes. It can't be repaired because the holes are in the middle of the fabric and shredded, not along a seam.<br /><br />The fit and styling are otherwise fantastic. I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. The stretch of the material allows it to fit like it was made for you. Just hand wash very delicately and lay flat to dry. Wear it a few times between washing! I'm very sad that I can't wear it and am trying to think of a way to patch it so that it doesn't look ridiculous!"
2.0,"They look awesome but absolutely REEK of glue. The glue is also not the kind that dries hard, it's mushy. Maybe worth it if glue smell doesn't make you sick and you only expect to wear them once but why bother"
2.0,"It was definitely too small, I use it as a top. The material is not good quality at all, but honestly I paid $7 so for the price, I guess I got what I paid for."
2.0,came undone after 3 months. very difficult to install.
2.0,"I honestly worried that they wouldn’t fit me so I go these leggings and todaaaa they fit! They make me even look confident and good! I wanna buy another pair! 10/10 will try again<br /><br />Update: after a few wears, holes started to form and they sadly ripped out of nowhere plus they fuzz up too quickly. So 3 1/2 out of 10"
2.0,Hard to open and close.  Would have been better buying a Tote at the drug store.  At least they have the button to deploy.
2.0,"Very ill fitting, bulky, and doesn't flatter at all."
2.0,"The tie dye color is much lighter and more pastel than pictured, MUCH more. They're also not control top as described."
2.0,"I initially was very pleased with this Briefcase.  It was aesthetically pleasing, large enough for my 15&#34; laptop and documents, and seemed to be of high quality.  However, the handle broke off the bag this weekend.  Although I've had the bag for a few months, I've carried it no more than 20 times, and usually I use the shoulder strap.  I will not carry a case that has a handle dangling off the side.  I am trying to find out how to contact the seller or whomever might be able to help me regain my satisfaction with the product, but since it's past the return window I cannot find a method. As of now, I am displeased with this bag."
2.0,Bad material. Reminded me of a poly rayon mix.
2.0,"Very very very long. Amazon did suggest a medium, but you never know with pants. I ordered a large. They fit around my waist, bum, however the fabric bunched in my groin area. Great feel and color. Very soft. Returning them."
2.0,"Disappointing the item that arrived, as they are not as pictured. if you see the picture the cuff-links dont have a black background which do come in the ones i received. i will be returning them, as detail is lost, as you can see on one of the dragons the wing is not as visible as the other one."
2.0,"This is a beautiful band, but it is NOT womens!  The product description NEVER said this was a LONG/LARGE band, but it is WAY too long to be a womens band!  I can't wear it!  !"
2.0,Way too small for most men's wrist. The overall feal of the watch is a bit dated and doesn't have a lot of the features of the rest of the G-Shock line. Had to send back.
2.0,"Appears from the photo the collar stands up, not true. Not made for petite women, comes to my knees."
2.0,Junk dont wast your money
2.0,The top way too small.
2.0,"Fit description was WAY OFF.....descent fabric & weight....inside sleeve lining was twisted....Never wore, passed on to a granddaughter who loves it. Would not buy again."
2.0,"Very cheap zipper, worried about breaking it in just carefully trying it on.  Sleeves are very tight. If you are a pear shape, this might work for you."
2.0,The hook clasp is very imperfect! Disliked this product
2.0,I bought this product for my sister a month before Christmas and it did not get here until January. The product is cute and my sister loved it once it got here but it took far too long to get here and it was difficult contacting the seller.
2.0,"Coin is 1/20th ounce and is really cute in the pendant that it comes with. However, the necklace is REALLY cheap."
2.0,Its pretty but it does not fit I will sale it to get my money back cause I don't want Amazon credit
2.0,Earrings were not lined up properly.... the whole reason i ordered this pack is because of these 2 styles in the pics and I can’t even use them!!
2.0,Hurts to wear them for more than 20 minutes
2.0,Cheap material but if you are only planning on using it for the season it will do just fine.
2.0,Waist a little tight but these do fit seems like a 5 Waist with a 6 length
2.0,Classes are small and tight and fit crooked as if whole frame is bent .
2.0,Earrings are unique and pretty but they fell apart. I put them together but they fell apart again. Not worth sending back
2.0,The seams along the neckline and arm holes didn't lay super flat.  I think that's what you get for what you pay for though.
2.0,I was going to give this as a gift but it is not good at all. The purple turns white when you go to put it on.
2.0,Not very happy:( this coat came un-sewing under the arm seam after only worn a couple of times.  Poor quality materials
2.0,"Cute and comfortable, but didn't even last a month. The top was glued onto the sole and it broke apart within a few weeks."
2.0,Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin
2.0,"This wallet is soooo cute. But It’s just naturally bulky! So when I stuff my receipts and 1 spare key some cash 0change and 10 cards, the thing will not close all the way! I am returning for something else :((("
2.0,not at all like the pic
2.0,This is the biggest waste of money ever a 150 dollar piece of crap that sits in my drawer for the last 2 years
2.0,"We purchased two sets of these dress up shoes, one to give as a gift and one for our daughters to share.  Each one had at least one pair of shoes that didn't match.  The flowers have fallen off of most shoes after wearing them the first time.  We are just disappointed all around and embarassed we gave the other set as a gift!"
2.0,"Im a 100 lbs and ordered a small and it DID NOT fit good at all. The shirt is a little oversized, nothing like the picture, but I can make it work. The shorts are so long and baggy and just fell off of me. I keep the shirt gave a friend the shorts."
2.0,"Loved the fit, but quality is poor. Guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,lens scratches easily
2.0,this does not look like what i see.the quality is too poor and it laps and pops in the arm.i suggest u put a connection btw both ends to pull that poff.i did not feel comfortable with the product and hace never won it since i mearsured it.
2.0,"it was too tight around my chest area and too wide on my stomach. It was short, too. Unfortunately I had to return it. Otherwise it was cute."
2.0,This dress is a simple nighttime dress it shouldn’t be worn outside of the house. Very thin and see-through along with bra lining that shows through the dress .
2.0,Tank looked badass but way too tight
2.0,I returned for the round ones because they match a necklace I have
2.0,Earrings are not red they are hot pink.<br />Other pair is true to color.
2.0,"WARNING: When you first take this wallet out of the plastic it's wrapped in, there is a Smell - like burning rubber! I mean, it's a stench, and I'm not kidding! However, it seems to being 'going down' after about a week - I haven't put this in my pocket yet (afraid the 'scent' will attach to my clothes) - waiting to see if it goes away. But get ready for it - you'll need to let the wallet 'sit' for a week or so to air out.<br /><br />I have written to the manufacturer about this smell problem and am waiting to hear back from them - when I do, I will post their answer here.<br /><br />One other thing - it is cut too small if you are putting American dollar bills into the wallet. It needs to be at least an 3/4"" taller - I do not know if this is because it was not intended for American money, or if the makers just decided to 'shave 'n save' a little bit on the material.<br /><br />Summary - don't buy this wallet. Look for another brand."
2.0,Way too small I would have to drop at least to dress sizes to fit especially if you have a larger bust I am almost always a medium and a size 8 I have a 36DD and 150lb and way to small
2.0,Did not last long! As a 6th grade teacher these shoes did not last long! After a fire drill in the rain I could not get the grass stains out!
2.0,Per the comments runs small
2.0,"I'm happy I got the cosplay 2 days earlier, but the quality sucks. I almost ripped the white blouse when i tried it on it fits perfectly just horrible quality blouse. I'm very disappointed but the rest of the cosplay is fine."
2.0,"For only spending $8 on this wallet, I wasn't expecting much.  The product is poorly designed (it is very thin and does not hold nearly as much stuff as the pictures depict). It is basically just two pieces of material poorly sewn together with slits in it for credit cards."
2.0,"Let me first sau that I'm not a big girl. I usually use S or M depending of the design. I was expecting a lot from this piece, and It desapointed me. I bought it hoping I could use this piece with my boyfriend, but I honestly think that I will use only the panties and throw away the top. The color black in lingerie is very beautiful on the body, but the top is extremely small ! I have a C cup bust and it barely goes through my shoulders. If I reallu push it I can't breath. The panties are a little just but it is possible to use and it looks good on the body.<br /><br />I wouldn't purchase this piece unless you have a very small body (like a Extra Small or something).<br />Disclaime: I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.and hope this can help you. If it did help you somehow, please press the &#34;YES&#34; button ate the botton, it really helps. Thanks."
2.0,"These were just what I was looking for, but very disappointed that the clip to adjust the length worked for about 1  day.  Tried others in the packet and none of those work.  If you are looking for adjustable length these are not for you."
2.0,Very thin! Cheap quality
2.0,I have been wearing this band for at least 2 months and the band is still quite stiff. The leather is not soft so it doesn't conform to my wrist.<br />The gray metal part that attaches to the Fitbit is losing it's finish as shown in the attached picture. I have an office job so I expected that the band would hold up to a desk job.<br />I would not buy a band like this again.
2.0,I like the leaf shaped ones but the drop ones are half the size. Bummed about that. Quality is good.
2.0,"Returned the item way too small and does not stretch. The top was so poor quality it just rolls up...I'm only a 34B so its not like I have nana to make this a difficult item, but it was"
2.0,"I had such high hopes for these. I bought a different style of these leggings that have the scrunch butt that is trending and I'm in love with them so I thought I would try out this style.  Right off the bat I had issues. The first pair I ordered was defective. The seam in the back on the waist band and the the seam on the butt was not lined up so it looks like your butt crack is crooked (not flattering at all). I sent them back and the new pair arrived and the new seam was aligned but the legs are SOOOOOOOO long.  I'm 5'8"" so not short for a girl and there was a good 6"" of fabric at the bottom which I didn't feel like was the cutest but it didn't really bother me until I wore the leggings for an entire day.  The leggings are great at not slipping they are form fitting but not uncomfortable unless you have 5"" of fabric bunched up at the bottom of the legs then it's extremely uncomfortable feels like you're wearing compression socks that are too small.  I would NOT recommend these. I saw reviews that cautioned on them being long but I didn't realize what a big deal it would be. NOT WORTH IT!"
2.0,"Updated Review: The masks I originally ordered were great. Three masks with good quality (see below for my original review). I decided to order more and the quality was not as good. The filter would not fit in the pocket, the opening was too narrow and there was no nose wire at all. But my original order had nose wire and openings for the filter to fit in. So the quality is very inconsistent, which is a disappointment. So I'm changing my review from five stars down to three.<br /><br />Original Review: Our kids, ages 3, 6, and 9 love these! We got the cat ones and they are acting like it's Halloween around here. We've had them for about a month now and the kids are happy to wear them when we need to go out. They seemed really big at first but did shrink with a few washes. For the little ones, I had to tie the ear peices to make them fit. Just ordered more!"
2.0,Very flimsy and cheaply made. Had they been made with stringer material they would be so much better.
2.0,SUPER short
2.0,order an xl..it's more like a m. Cheap material. Yuck
2.0,Looks cool... stones fell out after the second day...
2.0,"Sleeves were too small in diameter, hard to pull over the hands. 2 out of 3 buttons fell off first time it was worn. Very poor quality"
2.0,Really cheap quality and I see rainbows thru every tinted window. Its managable but dangerous when I'm driving. It legitimately blocks my view at times. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"I think this is a good idea but it’s not very practical. The magnet kept sticking to anything metal I got remotely close to, including and very continuously my truck. I was also scared to lose it all the time so I kept babysitting it all the time I wore it. I lost it once but found it the next day on my living room area rug. Today I finally lost it somewhere at work, well, I lost the face of it, the magnet stuck to something metal on my pants and dropped to the floor when I got home. But I never did find the beautiful checkered front. I would give it another shot if I get a replacement front, and could consider changing my review because I do like the product. I think it’s gorgeous, very classy and tasteful. It goes perfectly with all my outfits and it doesn’t ruin my ties with a hole. Thanks!"
2.0,Way too small for adult woman's size-8 shoe foot.
2.0,Bought a small for my 5’4” daughter and it was too big and just hung there- very shapeless.  Would probably work better on a taller and larger busted person
2.0,The whole dress was see through.
2.0,Small is not actually small<br />One in Reebok store which is small fits perfectly<br />Whereas this one is loose fit and does not compress the abs area at all
2.0,I ordered 3 pairs of clip-on earrings from Body Candy.  Two of them arrived broken.  I won't be buying anything else from them.
2.0,"Poor quality, very plasticy. I expected different for this brand and price. Not comfortable."
2.0,Hoped to get a good deal but these are oddly sized. I can leave them at my kid's house for when I visit. Not an everyday item for me.
2.0,Low quality stitching.
2.0,This fit very awkwardly and I doubt I’ll be using them :/
2.0,"Jacket color & quality seamed ok for price. However jacket was crop fitted, not at all what I expected so I returned."
2.0,"Does not match the picture.  Model has the bag on her shoulder with the two handles. Main reason I got it for versatility.  Bottle of water looks like it will barely fit, same with an umbrella unless really small.  When I took it out of the plastic it had an odor.  I will air it out and see what happens may be from the weather.  Has pockets that is what I was looking for.  Just know the picture is better than in person."
2.0,We're too small
2.0,Runs very small and fabryis thin and not at all soft
2.0,"Much smaller than anticipated, not as shiny and silver as it looks"
2.0,"These are very cute. However, the liner inside isn't stitched in well so it pulls out when the mittens hang out of the jacket by the string. I had to stitch it myself. Even then, the quality is just not there, especially for that price.  Save yourself the money and get something different."
2.0,"Too small on my back, shoulders and laces above the waist even though I went up one size. The sad thing is that my girlfriend wanted to surprise me for my birthday and bought me one the same size. So now I have two not fitted jackets!"
2.0,"Unless you have a head the size of a watermelon, these are much larger than another brand I purchased.  My wife and daughters are able to use them as headbands, but that's about it.  If you're female, or smaller, you may want to consider another brand or style."
2.0,Size was too small even though I order my size.
2.0,Over half didn't work upon arrival.
2.0,I found this to be unappealing. Too wide. I returned.
2.0,much smaller than I expected. Fit my niece so she has it
2.0,"The item picture looks like it’s actual glitter, what I got is a mask with glitter printed on it.<br /><br />Extremely misleading and also it did not come with the activated carbon pad inserts that the listing claims to have two with the purchase.<br /><br />It’s as if the one in the picture had glitter, they took the picture and printed it on a mask.<br /><br />So deceiving.<br /><br />Only reason I have it a 2 is because it is a mask. Just don’t expect the inserts. Or for it to look like the picture.<br /><br />They really should label it “glitter print” claiming it’s glitter is false advertising."
2.0,"I made 2 separate purchases (each a different size to find best fit). On BOTH pairs of pants, the buttons on the pockets are far to large to fit through the buttonholes! It's a REAL struggle to button them close or to open them. I can see this happening with 1 pair, but both?? Definitely won't be ordering this product again!"
2.0,"Basic popcorn knit - not as soft as other popcorn knit sweaters I've bought. The sweater is several inches shorter than shown in the photos supplied by the seller. It also lacks the textural detail. I tried a larger size, hoping it would be longer, but the only noticable difference was the width. On the plus side, the color matches. I really like the yellow color. The light blue pretty much matches the color of the photos. It's more of a periwinkle (purple tinted light blue). I liked the colors, but sweaters were too short, and disappointing because appear lower quality than advertised."
2.0,"New pair, one sock has a hole; only one day wearing, the other one has a big hole again."
2.0,Material is very cheap.  One wash and already faded.
2.0,"Sleeves are too tight. Material is not for summer. It’s uncomfortably thick and heavy. And because of this, it doesn’t hang or drop the way it supposed to. Definitely too hot in Philly right now to wear this."
2.0,"I wanted this blouse to really work but it was way to short not even a tunic. Color was great, but overall this was a fail."
2.0,"Pants run very short. I may be of average height (5'4"") but I have very short legs for my height. These pants were still about 2"" above my ankle which is an odd length, in my opinion. Also, the fabric is very static-y. It clings easily. One plus I could see, if the length works for you, is that they are super thin (yet not at all see through) so they'd be perfect to be a little dressy in hot temperatures. Also, the waistline was flattering. Basically, the length is my big deal breaker.. I could handle the rest."
2.0,Cute but broke very easily. Didn’t last through the day.
2.0,These hats are not very high quality but are fine if it isn't too cold.
2.0,Irritated ears
2.0,"Warning:  This is NOT a necklace and earrings. It's a PENDULUM and earrings.  And it's CHEAP JUNK.  I ordered it as a gift for myself after just coming home from being in the hospital.  I didn't realize from the pic that it wasn't a necklace or at least a bracelet.  Also, it looks like kids' play jewelry.  Amazon will NOT refund.  Very disappointing."
2.0,"I wear it, but it’s cheap metal, poor chain, and you can’t even put the pendant on a better chain"
2.0,The seems across the front Don't lay flat when its on.
2.0,Fits nicely around.<br />Padding is too thick. It adds nearly a whole cup size. Makes breasts perky and padding is stiff.<br />Just looking for a push up not a padded bra look.<br />Lace stitching is not even. One side is smooth and the other bends as it cuts in.
2.0,Okay looks decent good for a knock around watch that you don't really care about.<br />Crown stem is to tight breaks finger nails to adjust time & date fair quality grade D below average. Looks of watch are decent the hands illuminate but at below average duration.
2.0,i was expecting a loose fitting shirt-dress but it fits very tightly to the body. like skin tight. returned it. i would order up a few sizes if you want a fit like the picture.
2.0,Iv seen other people with hats like this in the past and in comparison I'm not impressed if I wasn't pressed for time to use it for a Halloween costume I'd return it I wish I had seen the review that stated that hat had a price tag of like 3-4 dollars when they received it in my opinion if your going to buy a hat of this style use a different vender this one is a overpriced joke!
2.0,Too small need to return. Can’t use this item.<br />Please send return label to refund.
2.0,"These are comfortable; however, the fabric pills severely after one wash.  These will become ""home"" pants. Definitely, not worth the money if you are looking for pants to wear outside the house."
2.0,"Very, very thin material."
2.0,Loved the boot but the shoelaces are very poor quality 😔
2.0,If you want these to be comfortable order two sizes up and don't expect them to last longer than a dozen days of wear. They are very cheaply made.
2.0,Only arrived with 2 sets of earrings instead of 3 but they are nice earrings
2.0,Order one or two sizes down.
2.0,The quality of fabric so bad :(
2.0,"Slightly cheap looking and the back of them easily bend unfortunately. Other than that, they look adorable and I still wear them time to time"
2.0,This look totally different on I would advise a size up because of length
2.0,I like the look and size of these glasses but they are very poorly made. Very loose (they fall off my face) and they are crooked.
2.0,Band was very thin and too big for my wrist. Sent back
2.0,"Like that it was leather, but, band broke and the weakest link, only lasted less then 7 months, won't buy again. For the price should have lasted much longer."
2.0,"The dress runs big. I bought a small for my sister and it was too big and shes a size small. The dress looks like the picture, however the length is not what is advertised. It is not like the picture, its very long. Way over the knees"
2.0,"I ordered these cardigans to wear with  the “supposedly “ matching sleeveless tunics.  The navy, burgundy and black cardigans were not the same shades.  They also ran very small.  I ordered a 3X which fit like a 1X.  Sleeves were too long and very tight.  Also did not like the placement of the pockets.  I really wanted to like these because of the reviews, but had to send back."
2.0,I really wanted to like these but the way that they bunch up in the crotch is very awkward.
2.0,"Super cute, but I knew from the moment I was putting it over my head, that the material was itchy. It's SLIGHTLY distracting, but I can imagine if I had to wear it for several hours, it might bother me. Also, the part where it dips in (at the armpits), dips in WAY more than any normal sleevless shirt would do. Thats actually the only reason I'm gonna return it because when. I start gaining weight, that area shows it first and looks like I chubby armpits, so its you're self conscious about that part of your body, this shirt shows that off WAY too much. Other than that, good for wearing to short outings like church or something, but for all day at work or anything cuz its too itchy"
2.0,"THIS UNDERWEAR HAVE MY PACKAGE ALL OVER THE PLACE . THEY DON'T PERFORM GOOD ON WALKING ,BIKING EXETERA EXETERA<br />HOWEVER THE FABRIC AND STILE IS NICE ."
2.0,"This dress looked too boxy,and the material is not good...it didn’t make Me look slim at all, it looked like I put on 20lbs"
2.0,"It did not hold up the sign I wanted, so I will have to try something else."
2.0,missing beads...
2.0,"The fabric was really stiff and the bust was too small, despite carefully reading the measurements before I ordered.  It didn't matter, though, because the zipper on mine wouldn't go past the halfway point anyway.  Even when I wasn't wearing the dress, it just stuck there.  I had to return it."
2.0,Runs small in the chest and waist area.  Two areas I normally don't have any trouble fitting.
2.0,"It's really adorable and fits very well. The color was spot-on, however I noticed after I wore it halfway through the day that there we're a few snags that are not able to be fixed. I can't return because I wore it half of the day."
2.0,What I was looking for but has broken after using it 2x
2.0,"These earrings were so beautiful when i received them. Got plenty of compliments but then after maybe about the 5th time, the needle u put through your ear lobes, just fell off! So i was very bummed out."
2.0,SO cute but I had to take out because they hurt my ears- and I don’t have sensitive skin to any metals.
2.0,"This is neither an elegant nor winter coat. I live in Wisconsin and would would freeze to death if I wore this in spring and especially in winter. It is made of felt like material and has a straight cut giving it a cheap look.  On the positive, for being made in China, it fits and yes it does have lining. I send mine back right away."
2.0,"I bought a med too big, I bought a small, too big, so I gave up. You can not wear the black with light colored clothing cause it bleeds. Also the dye gets on your skin and has to be scubbed off. After having a double mastectomy scubbing my skin to get dye off is not what I want to do."
2.0,Made great and sturdy however the top fits to your body and the bottom does not so it is completely useless for me...
2.0,The shirt fits great but the skirt will needed to be ordered 2 sizes up. I will need to send mines back. Overall its a cute outfit
2.0,"So I was excited to get this cute duo for my new Apple Watch series 7. I put the silver one on, and it started to snag on both my slacks and cardigan over and over again. It then scratched me and when I looked down on it, it had like a little hook open on the outer edge and I tried to push it down and had to file down the sharpness because I was at work and needed my watch, but it didn’t really work and got home and took it off. It’s a shame it wasn’t what I expected and a waste of money."
2.0,5'7 125 lbs and a large was too small. Immediately Ripped out of package and threw away in hotel trash as we were out of town so my ooh la la moment did not come to fruition.
2.0,they are too short and do not provide adequatesupport where needed
2.0,Funky seams made it lumpy. I returned it. Weird smushed product from the seller.
2.0,"I ordered a medium and it was WAYY too big and puffy (5'3"" 135lbs, 29"" waist, and 37.5"" hips). If you have a smaller waist order down a size or two. Also the string to tie it wasn't in there very well and came out in the wash immediately.  I am not happy with these pants."
2.0,Soaked up any dye on your shirt sleeve. It was dirty looking by week 2
2.0,Fit well. See three
2.0,Came bent in the mail and irritated my ear. When I tried to bend it back it instantly broke.
2.0,Love the design and the way they looked on me but very cheap.  The nose bridge is a very sharp metal and so uncomfortable. Would be nice if the bridge was a softer material.  It can't cost that much to change it.  I have other Quay sunnies that I love but not these.  Too bad though.
2.0,My son asked me  a wooden sunglasses for a gift. This one seems a nice one but when I received I thought it was a toy. It isn't  a wood but a plastic. Very disappointed
2.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my son.  He loves the design but I was a little disappointed in the quality.  Its a bit smaller than expected, I would size up.  Also, after only a few wears and washes, the fabric has really pilled up all over the sweatshirt.  I have sweatshirts I have owned for years that havent pilled like this one did after 2 washes."
2.0,The material is definitely not for the summer season.  It was not at all what I expected.
2.0,"I found this to be really bulky and uncomfortable, whether sleeping with it or wearing it during the day. It is also awkward to get the fitbit in and out. It does seem to track my steps correctly."
2.0,"These socks look so cute in the photos, with the scalloped edge super noticeable -- if you don't have super skinny ankles, though, the scalloped edge gets a little stretched out and they kind of just look like normal socks. They are pretty thin so I think that is why they get stretched over my ankle. They are still cute and comfortable though, but just not as scalloped as they look in the photos (on me, at least)!"
2.0,I ordered from Amazon the picking order again due to having lost one.  The ones I received are smaller.
2.0,"My daughter loved the shoes, but have to  return them because right shoe is not taking the charge."
2.0,Purchased a 9.5-10.5 because my husband wears a 10....his toes were SO cramped and pressed against the end! Size up!!
2.0,"Worked well for a few weeks but already broke apart at stitching. Not very durable.  Did not even use in extreme manner, just holding phone while walking"
2.0,"I wish this was sold as separates. At least for me, my top and bottom sizes are not the same, so while the bottom fit well in the size I ordered, the top was tiny on me so I had to return both."
2.0,"I have no idea why my item came in a underwear box that was open. The item did NOT even fit in the box.<br />This was very weird.<br />I wear a size 32 DD at victoria secret, so I ordered the c/d size, and yet it came as a size D.<br />With no instructions, I tried to line it up with the best I could but, all it did was pull my boobs together. NO lift at all.<br />I have no idea how the girl in the sample picture got her breasts to look like that (unless they are fake.)<br /><br />Overall, I like the idea of the product. It's not sticky when you take it off.<br />It clearly did not fit me right at all.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br />Even at the discounted price, I think I may return it. I'm scared the item has been used since it came in weird packaging."
2.0,Flimsy.  Not worth it to me.
2.0,"These tore on my first use. I know they’re only $7 but they should last longer than that. Also, they run a small which probably contributed to the tearing. I’m a size 9 and bought a medium. I should have bought a large."
2.0,"Loved the PINK, but is PEACH. Did not like color at all."
2.0,I have yet to attach a button. It is like the button is to thick. I have wasted about ten fasteners or more trying to make it work. it is like the fastener is to short.
2.0,"This didn't meet the expectations for the price and size/fit.  The straps make it a challenge to get on, which I don't want to deal with before coffee, and the cup pads shift, even though this is marketed as good for yoga.  Disappointed in this one."
2.0,Product is afew shades lighter then expected
2.0,"Exactly what I should have expected for the price. A super cheap looking piece of costume jewelry. Would be great for a Hippie costume on Halloween, but you could never get away with wearing this anywhere seriously. Even a teen at the beach in a sundress would feel like it was embarrassing."
2.0,"Delivered on time.<br /> But, it was missing an ear."
2.0,"I bought the xl but it is to small. If your a small person then the xl will fit like it should in the pic, but you dont offer any sizes over xl for me to swop for."
2.0,It was just ok not good quality for the price. The hems and seams frayed a lot when it first washed it.
2.0,These shoes offer little protection and no support for your feet. If they weren't Merrells I would not havebeen surprised. But since they were Merrells I expected both good support and medium protection for my feet. These are more like bottom of the line Sketchers. They look cuter in the picture than they do in person.
2.0,I typically wear a xxl so that's what I ordered. I found it to run quite big. I returned item.
2.0,This dress is very short and VERY see-through!
2.0,The fabric looked like a cheaper looser woven polyester. I returned it.
2.0,"Dress was fairly thin cotton fabric, much like your basic table cloth with no loner. Probably great for very hot weather. The small was way to big. I am 5'2 120 pounds."
2.0,The material was a lot more synthetic than I thought it would be. The print is also not very good quality and it does leave that plasticy feel to it. Overall okay if you don’t mind a lower quality print and fabric. Get what you pay for.
2.0,"Yes, the purse looked liked the bag, but the zipper was messed up. It will cost half of the price to fix it."
2.0,Cute but not comfortable will stick with reebok zig.
2.0,"In the picture it looks like a comfortable bra, however after trying it out it doesn't quite feel right. The material is perfect and the right size fit probably would make all the difference."
2.0,I wanted to love this but the color is so off from the color I wanted. I ordered the jacket in charcoal but it turned out to be brownish. I don’t know if I’ll be wearing it. It also fits weird on me and the material doesn’t feel that great either.
2.0,I returned this product as very thin and feel like the mesh would tear after a few washes.
2.0,What kind of disappointed it’s nothing like the picture is missing the graphic along the sleeves and it’s a 4X and it fits a little snug unhappy with the product it’s nothing like what the picture is and what I ordered
2.0,"It is what I would expect for the price. It does look cheaply made close-up, but most people are not looking at it that closely. I own this necklace in other colors and I often get compliments. The only down-side for me is the shade of green I received. In the picture, the necklace appears to be kelly green, but the one I received is more of a emerald green (darker than what I expected). Other than that it's not bad for the price."
2.0,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY smaller than i expected- this desc. should say &#34;COLLAR extenders&#34; and not come up in seaches for waist extenders
2.0,"I ordered these pants about two weeks ago. I was very happy with the style - they fit great and look great. Unfortunately, the very first time I pulled the pants on, the belt loop ripped away from the pants. I wasn't happy about it, but I was planning on ignoring it assuming that it was a fluke. I then started checking out the pockets and zippers. The zippers on the two front pockets were faulty. The first zipper I tried did not connect all the way up, so I was left with an opening at the bottom of the zipper. I tried the second pocket and found the same problem. I can't say that I was surprised though because the zippers are very lightweight.<br /><br />I would have been willing to overlook one or two of these problems, but given that there were three faulty items on these pants I decided to return them. I just don't trust them to hold up very long. I hope the manufacturers improve the quality of these pants because I honestly loved how they looked."
2.0,"Not really well made shades,don't really block those harmful rays"
2.0,THESE WERE JUST CHEAP THROW AWAY GLASSES . . . .  OK FOR A ONE OR 2 TIME USE . . .
2.0,This is the second time I ordered this item and it doesn't even last a month it breaks everytime I'm done
2.0,The dress size ran small. I would return it and try a larger size but I was also sent the wrong color and no shipping label to return it. It has been a pain trying to get it sent back. IF I get my money back I may improve the rating to 3 stars.
2.0,"Comfortable on my wrist, the outside is pristine, however the QR code that discloses my medical info in the event of an emergency is already unreadable. I wear my watch daily, not too tight, and take it off to sleep. I do not do sports or any rigorous activities while wearing my watch. Not sure it’s worth buying a new one every six months which is a shame, it allowed me to feel safe in public without wearing an additional bracelet."
2.0,The material used is too thin for what i thought it would be. Seemed kinda of cheap. Only good for wearing around the house.
2.0,definitely too small
2.0,"I'm normally a 1X, so I ordered a 2X the dress was to small and too short. Maybe I should have gone up 2 sizes. I'll know next time if there's a next time."
2.0,I love the bracelet except that I can't wear it as it falls off...The clasp is not secure.  I have had it for just under a year.
2.0,"This is very form fitting, so the pattern helps with hiding any problem areas, but I was seriously underwhelmed when I put this dress on.  The materials seems cheap in person, and the neckline stitching puckered a bit in a distracting way.  The neckline really wasn't flattering either with the height right across the neck.  I returned it."
2.0,I dislike that the pads did not stay in place under dresses. I am not sure about pants. Top rolls down even though it's low cut.
2.0,"Like the watch but can not get the links off to make it smaller, very difficult"
2.0,"The XL is tight on  me, I'm 5'6&#34; 131lbs, usually wear a small and medium but these are tight and that means the excess fat gets squeezed out and you can't wear them with form fitting stuff. Now I have a big but and hips already so if you are flat in that area they may be ok."
2.0,The flowers are made of some kind of metal making this very heavy and clunky. I am afraid it might nick my skin as well if I were to wear it. The clasp was not working and I am not sure I will ever get a chance to wear this. Very disappointed.
2.0,"2 Stars because wrong size was sent. 4 stars on quality and feel. Now I ordered a size 13/1 and I needed them by Thursday the latest since we were leaving for vacation on Friday night. When the package arrived my daughter was happy, until she tried them and and they didn't fit. The packaged stated 13/1 and the bag they came in also stated 13/1 but the slipper tag and the bottom of the slipper stated 11/12. Too small and now no slipper on the trip. I will have to try and find some in our travels."
2.0,A flimsy cover not worth the money.
2.0,Glasses look rad but they scratch super easy right in your line of vision. I tried to be careful with them and the blue mirror coating scratches ant pits easily.
2.0,"This jacket runs extremely large. I ordered size Small, which should have been a perfect fit for me based on the size chart in the product pictures. It was enormous!!! I looked like a child who tried on her dad's jacket. I'm 5' 3"" and 105 lbs, for reference.<br /><br />I'm sad because this looks really well made and was exactly what I was looking for, at a fair price. Just not made for us petite ladies!"
2.0,"Color is beautiful, but the cups are hard plastic and super uncomfortable."
2.0,It went off both 2 times for my 2 testing trips
2.0,"Cute fireman costume. My LO loved it & looked adorable in it. The reason I’m only giving it 2 stars is because it arrived with noticeable dirty smudges on the yellow stripes (one of the smaller smudges is pictured). I reached out to the seller & customer service was dismal at best. It did wash well, but smudges only partially came out. I was NOT given a partial refund!!"
2.0,"I agree with those who have commented that they are very comfortable.  The mesh fabric is quite soft and they fit great in the rear.  The pouch/sheath though on the pairs that I purchased  (olive, white & black) is ridiculously large and not as form fitting on the model shown.  I mean LARGE... I'm average size in that department but you would literally have to be around 8 or 9 &#34; flaccid for these to look proper.  I'm wondering if there was just a manufacturing error.<br /><br />Anyone else care to comment?  Of course, taking them to a tailor would be a bit embarrassing so I just live with them and make sure I'm not undressing in front of anyone while wearing.  HA."
2.0,"Although it is a stretchy material, and had nothing wrong with it, IT WAS WAAAYY TOO SMALL. I am not a big girl by any means but boy was this fun to attempt to put on. Super disappointed. One size doesn't actually fit all!"
2.0,"Great shorts, perfect summer weight, all my others were too hot. So I was so disappointed when the fabic started to pill on my first wear! :-( I bought one of the prints so it's not as obvious as I imagine it would be on the solids, so I won't return them but would not purchase again."
2.0,Colors should have been flat instead of shiny!
2.0,"I've been experiencing some hair breakage lately and thought I'd try the 21st century equivalent of a nightcap to see if that helped. As much as I like satin and the sweet shade of pink, sadly this did not want to stay on my regularly sized and shaped head. It kept falling off and I have regretfully put it away, but am secretly relieved that I don't look like some crazy character out of a regency novel or possibly Dickens."
2.0,"These shoes looked good when we got them, but my son wore them to one basketball practice and he was slipping and sliding all over the floor! He was embarrassed that he could hardly stay on his feet. I’m thinking these might be better suited on an outdoor basketball court, or if you’re just buying them for the look and not actually playing basketball in them. Returning for ones with better grip on the bottoms!"
2.0,Xl is really a large.. the sleeves is really a  extra small size
2.0,Well it's not beige...it is more peach than beige. That really threw me off. It is a pretty coat but I really wish it was not peach.
2.0,"I don't like how it hangs in the back. Sleeves are bit tight, but I have bigger upper arms. I will be returning it."
2.0,Took a long time to receive
2.0,It did not fit according to the size chart. It was small
2.0,"The robe is sized small, so order larger."
2.0,Really disappointed in the size. It runs small
2.0,Not made for DDD or DD. They only hold the breasts up by 2 inches
2.0,Too many of the same fresh water snail she'll African snail
2.0,It may just be a personal preference but I prefer the shirt stays the come four separate. I tried these and they weren't comfortable to me.
2.0,"This looked like such a great shirt from online! When I received it the sizing was wayyy off, I ordered a medium and it was true to size, except for how incredibly long it was. The color was also bright turquoise stripes as opposed to the nice light blue pictured."
2.0,It is ok picks up a lot of lint and gets dirty material is thin.
2.0,It bleeds messed up my pillows
2.0,They did not tell me to put them in a case.  The nose piece is off.
2.0,"It looks good so far, i haven't tried it on yet<br />Update: its too big and the ring broke :( unhappy with my purchase"
2.0,"Strap broke in a few short months. Didn't overload the bag either.  The following was my initial review (before it broke)......<br />For the price, it's a nice bag. The zippers are just ok. Same with the inside lining. Wish it were a little stronger material. Otherwise, the look and feel of the outside is great!  Classic color!"
2.0,It's too big on me. It stretches so thats good for a person with a big head but the band isn't sturdy. It's ok. I might give it to my dad and get a new one like a baseball cap
2.0,"I ordered this shirt because I thought it would be cute and stylish, and it was, but I had to return it because it was EXTREMELY short. I ordered an XL because I knew it would be generally short because it's a crop top, but I got it in the mail and it looked like this shirt was for a toddler. Not to mention it was also very tightly fitted, which made it even more uncomfortable. I would not recommend ordering this shirt if you are expecting a comfortable, loose top."
2.0,"While many bands of this kind are infinitely adjustable, this one can only be set to a handful of lengths, the shortest of which was still too large for my wrist.  The clasp is also *very* hard to open.  The band may work for you, it didn't work for me, and returning it would cost as much as I paid for it."
2.0,Very light weight however the text is raised. Chain is very light weight and seems frail. Also chain is coarse when rubbing fingers on it. Was expecting it to look like the picture but sadly it is not. Pendant feels like same material that fake coin money is mad out of.
2.0,Muy cortas y mal acabado
2.0,I actually ordered this twice. The sizing is crazy. Once its on i found it to be bigger and it just didn't fit the way i expected.
2.0,"My sister bought these for my son as a birthday gift.  The strap was completely severed and someone stapled it back together.  Hard to know if the seller did this or if it was returned and not checked by the seller before reselling it to someone else - either way, it’s pretty disappointing. Otherwise they they seem to fit well and are comfortable.  We want to buy another pair ... that is actually new and undamaged."
2.0,They are pretty and you get alot of them for the price it's great! They are too big and kind of hard to breath through.  Now I am stuck with all these masks.
2.0,The band hurts my temples and gives me a headache. Also at daiso this costs less than half.
2.0,The strap on the back of herl is not adjustable and it is a little loose on the heel so it's uncomfortable.
2.0,"Great concept,  they just don't stay in place with a crawling baby."
2.0,Returned.  I ride distance and the padding was very thin
2.0,You can not see the t in &#34;to&#34; nor the a in &#34;and&#34;😔
2.0,Just seems cheap and the band is very stiff.
2.0,"I was hoping for more of a cotton fabric. It's quite shiney and the fabric looks cheap when stretched out. The shape is fine, but it shows every lump and bump. You'll need some shape-wear underneath to wear it."
2.0,"The bag is cute, but I received the wrong color 😩"
2.0,"They were a little thicker than I expected. I couldn't use any of the, the L shaped ones, in the corner it isn't rounded and quite sharp. I sent them back"
2.0,"Seems to be well-made, however considering the extremely small size of this item, the measurements should be included in the description.  A penny more than covers this Poor Poodle.  Going back."
2.0,"I was shocked when this arrived...I am 5ft 4in and it is short on me, not as long as the pic shows and it is very wide....I ordered an XL it's more like a 2XL for a petite person very disappointed"
2.0,So small foot could not fit into the boots.  Ordered whole size up and will see what happens.
2.0,"When these shoes first arrived, they were squished up in the packaging...the inside soles were not glued down and the size was way to big.  I had bought these for my 5 year old who needed slip on's for his karate class so we will keep them just for that and its not worth going through the trouble of printing a label and returning them and ordering another one from the same company."
2.0,"For the price, I wish it wouldn't fade and tarnish so easily. It was nice while it lasted. But I won't buy again."
2.0,"I loved this shirt! The fit, the color, wasn’t sheer even though it was white, wasn’t a crazy material that made me sweat. BUT…. First time wearing in and it ripped. While inexpensive enough to order again, I can’t justify having to purchase a new shirt to wear once. Super disappointed!"
2.0,Not true to size. The arms especially are too tight.
2.0,I do not like the quality of the material it looks cheap...
2.0,"Small fit, very scratchy material and it says dry cleaning preferred.. can only imagine how it will wash up so be aware dry cleaning only way to clean it"
2.0,Difficult too use
2.0,"These were good sunglasses, however they only lasted 4 months. I put them on while driving and the loop holding one of the lens snapped. I never abused them. They are a waste of money because they don't last."
2.0,We liked the collars and they fit well but they did not control the dogs either one. We bought to thinking that they would work. We have two Australian Shepherd's who like to chase rabbits and cats. And we needed something that would pull on them when they would leave at them and The collars didn't work
2.0,"The sewing was haphazard, the seams are coming undone.  The trim was not even with fabric edging. The fit, feel and shape are all good."
2.0,This bag is sewn tight and it doesn’t carry much.
2.0,Sizes are off.
2.0,I bought the extra large in this and it came in the mail to be sized like an extra small  nOt A gOOd dAy
2.0,"The top that I received fits nothing like the photo. It's shorter, tighter, and the overlap isn't as prominent. Instead, the drape fits a little strangely. Because it's shorter than I expected, the criss-cross design hits above my waist, and this just isn't flattering. I'm really disappointed because I really like the 3/4 sleeves and the style that is shown in the photo. It just doesn't fit well on me."
2.0,These seem to fall out. They dont have like a knob or bulb at the end. Not a huge fan. Like the different colors & sizes
2.0,Very small. Also the fur sleeve part seen in the pics doesn’t exist. It’s just the hand/glove part. I bought them because they appeared to include the forearm sleeve part. They don’t.
2.0,This must have been the display model<br />the tags were missing and the lens were covered in thick finger prints.<br />Gross
2.0,"Just receive in I order a small,I wear a size4-6. As the chart showed. Romper is nice but to big. This rompers runs big.smh"
2.0,Ordered a Men's XL and it was more like a woman's small
2.0,Horrible in cold weather.  Buy something else. Hands froze immediately in 33 deg weather. Not recommended.
2.0,"Cute bathing suit overall, but I didn't realize until my daughter wore it that one of the straps is sewn on twisted.  Ruffles on the straps only make it more noticeable when worn."
2.0,Got so small after washing came up to mid shin.
2.0,It was too big in the back half and too tight by the toes. Really stiff and cheaply made. Returned.
2.0,I'm 5'3 and they were too long and didn't stay up. Too warm for my preference as well.  Giving them away.
2.0,Exactly one month since i purchased this item and the strap got unattached. Disappointed!
2.0,The thermal is good quality but is way too short. I ordered the large and it was so short it goes only to the end of my abdomen.
2.0,"Pretty, but super cheap."
2.0,"Cheaply made. Fresh out of package and the seams are alreadt unraveling. Bummer bc its a cute suit. Also, I ordered up bc of the reviews when my normal size would have been a better fit."
2.0,I would have sent this back but I waited too long. Terrible seam lines - looks awfully cheap. I'll never wear this.
2.0,"Did not work for my husband. He previously owned a similar cap bought from a different haberdashery. It was his favorite for 20+ years until it started falling apart. I bought this as a gift for him to replace the other cap but this one has a strange fit and is very rust colored, different from the online photo. The band fit fine around his head but the upper part of the cap extends too far out, making his head look like a mushroom. This actually might work better as a young woman's cap, but definitely not for my mature husband."
2.0,Side pockets are not very attractive.
2.0,Didn't do what i needed it to do and the bottom of it eventually ripped after 2 months of light use.
2.0,"I think I was just too tall for this dress. It was a cute fabric, but the fit was off. The waist did not hit anywhere my natural waistline like in the pictures, but it wasn't anywhere near an empress waistline, either. Just awkward. I sent it back."
2.0,Kinda cheap I guess cause it was too small for my old eyes but still kinda pretty I didn’t want exspensive cause I cannot keep taking off and putting on myself so it’s fine
2.0,"Purchased as a replacement band for SM-R720. looked great, and was able to wear it for approximately 25 minutes before the connecter that attached the band to the watch face fell off. I reattached it over the next hour 3 times. before deciding to return to the seller. loved the way it looked and felt. however with the watch not being secured to the band, I do not feel justified in keeping the band.<br /><br />Follow up- I received an email from customer service that offered to send a second watch band to me. Note I did not contact customer service they contacted me which I thought was very cool. But upon receipt of the second band had the same issue. I could wiggle the watch band away from the face in seconds, and I'm not risking a $230 watch on something that falls off."
2.0,Just unflattering
2.0,super thin even though it's 2 layers. Runs small and I ordered 2 sizes up. I returned it. The style itself is actually nice if the material wasn't so thin.
2.0,"While I love the chain and the fact it arrived lightning quick, this is a HUMONGOUS let down. When I opened the bag it came in, it was hanging on the card by only one side of the necklace while the rest lay tangled in the bottom of the bag. On both sides the eye is off center by more than 'just a little', the silver ring it is enclosed in is not on track with itself, and the piece that attaches the charm to the chain is also overlapped and causes the charm to hang completely off balance. I wanted to love this SO badly but am completely let down."
2.0,I am very disappointed in these bandanas. They are board stiff even after 3 washes. Planned on using them as face coverings during the COVID-19 Pandemic for myself and family. But the stiffness of the fabric makes for a very uncomfortable and scratchy mask. I would like to return them and be refunded but probably not able to since they have been washed.
2.0,"Size chart says 38 waist is an XL, I'm a 38 waist and I couldn't even get the pants on. It even tells you to order your normal size, but my normal size didn't even fit me so if you're a bigger guy then I recommend you order a size or two up. Material isn't the greatest. If you have pets then expect these pants to collect every hair in your house. Style is nice, just wish there was a warning about the sizes."
2.0,the fit was weird and not like the picture
2.0,It was pretty but it looked a little cheap personally. Like it was made out of curtains. It could look nice on some people I'm sure but not on me
2.0,"Pretty from the front, but cheap from the back."
2.0,the material of the item is not what i expected
2.0,"Arrived on time as promised, but the pieces started coming apart. I will not be ordering from Bling Jewelry again because this pair did not last long at all."
2.0,Nice pattern kimono but the sizing is way off. Ordered a large but fit like a small
2.0,Band was weak. Not a great design
2.0,definitely for an adult head.  bought for teenage son and he cant wear it since its too bog
2.0,"These gloves would be great if they offered them in a smaller size. I'm fairly big guy at 6'2&#34; 190 lbs, and these gloves are too big for me. I'd give 5 stars if there were a medium size, but as it is expect these gloves to fit only if you're a huge person."
2.0,Runs really small.  I had to return them as they did not fit.
2.0,It was good quality but I personally didn’t like all the pockets a d handles
2.0,Did not care for this fit.  Uncomfortable
2.0,The earrings themselves are great quality but the backs never stay screwed on. I lose them constantly in showers or even sleeping. Will not buy again.
2.0,"Very sheer and too big, baggy."
2.0,It took awhile to get it delievered and once I did get it I had a nice pink shirt to wear with it however its really itchy and I can't have it on long or my head gets red. I was going to order more colors until I actually wore it but its not bad if you don't plan on wearing it all day.
2.0,"The so-called XL briefs are too small for me -- I usually take clothes in large size, or even a medium -- so something's wrong with these ..."
2.0,"This item was rec'd in a bag (inside the packaging)  that looked like it had been sent to 20 people and returned before me.  The overalls inside were not folded, not even rolled but just shoved in the bag in a ball and therefore massively wrinkled once I took them out.  Have you ever tried to get an idea of how something looks on when its completely covered in wrinkles? Not good right off the bat.  The overalls are made of a very thin material, (lightweight yes) so much so that you can see completely see through them.  Front pockets show through and it the light (in my house) I can even see my legs inside them.  Based on the reviews I ordered a size up (large) and they fit fine but I'd say that after one wash and dry, they might be a 1/3 of the original size.  I'll have to see if it's worth returning these.  They might be great to paint in (the material is very similar to the lightweight material painting tarp you get at Home depot) if you need to buy something for that purpose?Oh, also they are not beige and not off white like the photo shows, they are definitely more of a light yellow!"
2.0,I didn’t like how the material felt. The shirt was very thin and shear. It isn’t what I expected.
2.0,"Scarf is cute, hat is very small and pattern is off..."
2.0,The glasses looks good but we ordered 10 glasses but only received 9 glasses.
2.0,"Not worth the purchase!! Within a few weeks it was tarnished, missing stones, and turning my finger green! Not only green but I got weird red itchy bumps. I am allergic to nickel, which tells me this was a cheap ring."
2.0,I ordered one of these before and liked it a lot even though it broke a few times. I ordered a new one thinking I would have better luck and the quality on the new one was terrible. The shape of the butterfly was undefined as if the metal overran the mold it was poured into. I am returning it and sad that I have to because I like the style
2.0,"Cute Necklace / Poor quality looks better in pictures then in person . When I opened it , it reminded me of the cheap necklaces you get from the quarter machines."
2.0,"great looking cap; however, the depth is relatively shallow - it doesn't sit well on ky jead and blows off with very little wind"
2.0,two size smaller then described
2.0,"This dress is pretty.  The material is heavy, but not too heavy.  However, it really runs small I mean way too small.  Some will be blessed with a great dress."
2.0,Legs are very short. Crotch only came about 1/2 way up my thighs.
2.0,"Wasn't very impressed. It fit smaller than I anticipated, and also very low. It was suppose to be high waisted but it comes at least an kncje below my belly button. Quality felt cheap too."
2.0,This looks like a children's dominatrix outfit.....
2.0,"The printed image was stuck to itself and damaged first of all.<br />Also, even though I ordered a size larger as recommended, it was easy too small.  XL looks more like a Medium."
2.0,Really bad material. Was sorta see through and size ran big
2.0,Very pretty top but fit too tight at the bottom. Returned
2.0,Pretty but runs really small. Returned it
2.0,"I've ordered these for my granddaughter before and they were great.  So I wanted another pair since she's grown out of the originals.  I used the size chart attached to this item, received them in a few days, and the shoes are WAY TOO BIG.  Heading down the return maze.  So please DO NOT use their size chart!!"
2.0,"Sizing is on point; however after the first wash, the elastic in the waist twisted, and I can’t get it to lay flat.  If you purchase, I would suggest hand washing and hang dry.  These were cute and fit perfectly.  I have not tried ironing.  I just wanted a wash, dry and wear type of shorts.  These are not."
2.0,We got these for a hike down the Grand Canyon and ordered the size Dave has worn for years but they fit weird. The seat is very tight and the legs were impossible to hike in. He opted for jeans and the new ‘hiking pants’ were left at home.
2.0,I received the ear rings but not the ring. I see the package with an empty baggie where the ring was supposed to be as you can tell by the photo
2.0,Ok so I only bought these for how nice the print on them looked hoping they would be good or even decent quality. The print was beautiful in person but there was a strong nasty plastic smell when I opened them. I washed them twice but still had a plastic funk smell. I owe them a couple times but they just slide down! Poorly made and poorly designed.
2.0,"The neoprene is hard and not comfortable, plus the strap itself is not very long"
2.0,I’m sad that I had to give so little stars. I was pumped to get this for the summer thought it’s be cute and great as a cross over. No ! This is very small.  I was first attracted to it for size but this is like child size not a small clutch size.I had to give mine to my 7yeat old cousin. It’s made a little cheap but can’t complain due to price. I’m averaged sized so it looked odd to wear. This is for kids.
2.0,Too short  (above the ankles)<br />Height: 5 6&#34;<br />Weight: 112 pounds
2.0,"I really like the look and feel of these shades, but one of the arms broke off for me in less than 6 months. They were never sat on or similar. Just flipped them open one day and the arm came off."
2.0,Has a very uncomfortable band at the waist. I had to constantly adjust it throughout my day. The material makes an annoying swishing sound when walking!
2.0,"cheap materials, magnetic buckle do not hold"
2.0,I love the colors they are very vibrant  but unfortunately only 3 of the 10 weren’t chipped and had paint falling off of them I would gladly send them back for new ones
2.0,The pair I have worn obtained a run up the backside right away.
2.0,The color is very nice as is the fit. The deal breaker for me is the fact that it is handwashable only. Life is too short... going back.
2.0,"It was great at first but as you wear everyday, after a week, the strap gets dirty very easily.<br />You can see spots and marks all of the straps and can’t use it anymore. It was only good for 7 days."
2.0,Fit too big
2.0,"They look nice but WAY to small for a VCH Piercing, no use for them"
2.0,"Well, this was really disappointing. I was expecting it to be larger than what it turned out to be- about the size of a nickel. More like a trinket from a gumball machine than the sophisticated item I was hoping for. I don't know why some of these jewelry sellers don't ever photograph their items on actual people."
2.0,"It's a nice piece, but very small -- the pendant is only about 1/2 inch long (about 13 mm), and I don't see this information on the product page. It's hard to see the design even at close distance. I would give it 5 stars if it was around 1 inch long.<br /><br />Update 5/21/18:<br />My wife liked it, but after a while one of the rings on the pendant that the chain connects to opened up, and she almost lost the necklace. I carefully closed the gap in the ring, but a few days later it opened up again. Now the necklace sits in a ziploc, and I'm trying to find out if it's possible to weld the gap in those two rings and prevent them from opening again. I'm knocking off one more star because of this design flaw."
2.0,What I really needed were bi-focal sunglasses. These are not!  The frames are comfortable but flimsy. Not what I needed
2.0,Did not look like picture. Decided to return it.
2.0,"I'm 5'0&#34; and the Small came to my knees.  But the reason I returned the robe was because the sleeves were huge...wide.  They would've knocked something over or gotten into make-up, etc.  The color of pink was very pretty."
2.0,Not much of a shift dress. I'm 5'1&#34; about 120lbs. I ordered a large and It sticks to me. It is also too short to wear without pants. I don't suggest you buy this unless you want a tightly fitting tunic.
2.0,"Exactly as described. However, the material is cheap and it broke apart after just one night out. I do not recommend this."
2.0,Too tight for my ear.
2.0,looks cheap. white lace is super bright and doesn't blend well with shirt. just awkward
2.0,"Didn't care for this purse. It was bigger than I thought, I didn't care much for the material, and just seemed really stiff. I eventually ended up giving it away."
2.0,Love it- fits smaller than expected
2.0,Not at all what I expected the sleeves are not done right I'm not sure if I'll ever wear it 🙁I'll probably cut the sleeves and make something else out of it . The material is nice and soft .
2.0,"This is a lovely dress let down by how it fits and drapes.  It fits wider in the waist by around 1.5-2 inches more than the size chart.  The waistline is also really high.  Lastly the fabric makes for a boxier shape as its too stiff and doesn't drape well.  If the waist line was a bit lower, size was more accurate and it was a lighter weight fabric I would but it in every color."
2.0,Set of 6 but half of them are broken. The first one broke and we threw it away but then noticed two more right out of the bag are broken as well so he can’t use those either.
2.0,$25?????!!!!!! For what I just got? So so so flimsy and thin. Lol I would feel comfortable buying this at CVS for max $12.
2.0,"While the material was thick, not sheer, and had a little stretch to it and was comfortable, the color was much brighter and the cut was very odd. It was too large in most places, not quite right in the chest."
2.0,"I liked the jacket but the sleeves were cut very, very small for the size I ordered.  Also, general size ran small. Quality seemed good."
2.0,nothing but room for cards I did not understand when I purchased it
2.0,For people with really really small necks
2.0,"This dress sits about mid-calf compared to what I expected from the photo. The fabric was more of a slick fabric rather than t-shirt fabric, which wasn't bad. The waistline sat at my natural waist. The sleeves were relatively loose and came to a few inches before my wrist, which makes sense because I'm taller than average. Doesn't really look like the picture."
2.0,No es como lo esperaba  ennla foto se ve dorado  y es beige<br />Demaciado  pequeña yonla pedi XXL  llego esa talla pero queda como L
2.0,"it bent the spring bars,  the holes of the bands are NOT in line with the aquaracer’s holes which bent the spring bars. maybe a manufacturer's defect?<br />make sure you have spares (spring bars)! it's also quite hard to install.<br /><br />i've attached pics for reference.<br />maybe curved spring bars would work? not sure...<br /><br />lastly, once you get everything to work, and you're not afraid that the bent spring bars will drop your watch, it's comfortable and pleasing to the eye. the deployment buckle is great too."
2.0,Arrived with one of the leaves broken off. I put it back on but it keeps falling off so I don't even wear the necklace anymore.
2.0,It turn dark.
2.0,There are no instructions on how to change the day/date!!
2.0,I am 5&#34; tall and it looked funny and huge. the sewing on the bottom front was crooked and the whole area was sticking out like for a mail.
2.0,Weird fit and cut compared to the old summit series
2.0,"Just a bit too small. Would have ordered a bigger size but it is also a wee bit too short for me. Overall cute skirt, but not very functional."
2.0,"Graphic looked great, but the bottom hem was very uneven. Long in the front short in the back. Sizing up wouldn’t have mattered. Do not recommend anyone buy this"
2.0,It took way too long to get here and it’s not as eye catching as the foto online.
2.0,The material is not cotton and quickly creates a stench.
2.0,"The metal clip is very flimsy and doesn't really hold onto my cash.  This thing holds cards in too tightly, making it difficult to just get one out when you want to purchase something.  The black paint chipped instantly and the carbon fiber looks like hell after a couple months."
2.0,Glasses were to big for my face. Not a good fit for me.
2.0,"The material is so cuddly and I love the color, but it is SHOUTCAST. The photo doesn't do it justice. I'm returning it because it is essentially a crop top. I know that style would be perfect for some people, but it isn't what I was looking for."
2.0,"The picture did not do the product justice as far as material. I didn't like it. If you plan to buy, check on that."
2.0,they're only good for cloudy days.
2.0,Lost umbrella first time I used it.  Wind turned it unside out and broke the hinges.
2.0,Color is a little different in real life & they look cheaply made . The fit runs small
2.0,"Looks as pictured. Didn't last a day before one of the small metal buttons that holds the strap to the bag busted off, literally as I was standing still. Had hardly anything in the bag that would make me believe the bag had too much weight in it.<br />Positives: Cute, great size shoulder bag, lightweight"
2.0,"Your most likely looking at this belt because you’ve seen the Klik belts or other Cobra style belts and realized that they were asking 80 bucks for a belt!! This price point is more what your looking for. And you definitely get what you pay for.  It’s a knock off for sure but it works mostly. Definitely not as thick as a Klik belt and the Klik belt will last a lot longer than this one. This style belt always requires you to remove one side of the buckle so you can feed the belt through the belt loops.  Some tactical pants are wide enough to feed through withought.  I personally wear the “Propper” tactical pants and the loops are too narrow.  Not sure how they work with 5.11 pants. This is how the belt is.  It’s not a fault of this belt. Now my biggest complaint is the belt loop keeper.  I do not know how the keeper is on the Klik belt but on this one its a cheap price of elastic that can easily come off.  Every time I remove this belt from my pants, this loop keeper either falls on the floor (luckily I have seen it) or it gets stuck in one of my pant belt loops.  It’s insanely annoying.<br /><br />This style belt is awesome though.  I drink a lot of electrolyte water so I find myself running to the restroom often.  This belt makes it SO easy.  You think its no big deal now but once you try this style click belt you will literally laugh at how a regular belt works and how long it takes.  The pulling back to find the right hole, the feeding it through buckles and loops etc.  This is set once and its good. Just click it on and off.  But you do have to set it first.  Allow extra time just to put on your belt in the morning!<br /><br />So I am stuck with this knock off belt until I get the courage to buy a real Cobra style belt.  I have no regrets buying this belt for 14 bucks because now I know why this click style belt is becoming so popular.<br /><br />05-14-19 update<br />So I have been wearing this belt for about a week and its already starting to show how cheap it is.  It’s flimsy and the belt loop keeper is absolutely useless.  It stretched out and wont stay in place.  So if you don’t have a properly placed belt loop to catch the extra, its going to curl.  Because its so flimsy.  I saw a belt from Vedder holsters. Same concept but it has a narrower buckle so you can feed it through belt loops and it has Velcro to hold down the extra.  It’s pricey but its worth it now!<br /><br />05-16-19 update<br />The elastic holder is completely stretched out and useless.  Ive only had this belt for two weeks.  But I did figure out that after you feed the belt through your pant loops, you can feed it through the buckle part in reverse and fold the excess under the belt.  This keeps the extra tucked away.  I ordered the Vedder belt so I only have to deal with this belt for a couple more days.  and the Vedder belt is same price on Amazon as on their website if you include shipping."
2.0,The hats that caused me to order this were not in the box. And only 6 of 9
2.0,I really liked this product however after wearing it once it started coming apart.
2.0,"I bought these expecting they would attach nicely to my prescription glasses and they slide down and off my nose.  I was hoping they had hooks at the top to hold onto my glasses for a better fit.  The glasses are nice, but I wouldn't have ordered if I would have known."
2.0,Bad fit looks generic
2.0,Slouchy
2.0,Majesty heat look flat . Not flattering but it it is very pretty and comfortable
2.0,"color was browner than expected, one pocket was partially sewn shut and although I ordered this size before the back at waistline rode lower by alot"
2.0,"It was listed as xL and was maybe a medium, the seams were also in odd places making the butt unflattering and uncomfortable"
2.0,Top of dress is not proportionate and way too small. Not sized as stated. They charged me for two and I can wear neither and too expensive to return. I am out the money.
2.0,It is missing the clasp to buckle the strap.
2.0,It is not sweat shirt it is tee-shirt the non-stretch kind. It is short and not oversized at all I wear a medium but ordered a xl it fits but is tight out what I was expecting at all.
2.0,"The fabric is lovely in texture and color. The feel is wonderful, like a very lightweight suede. The stitching is superb. BUT -- these gloves were sold as multifunctional. They were supposed to be warm. The leathery strips were supposed to be used for touch-tech switches, keyboards and screens. They're only so-so.<br /><br />Real bottom line: they feel good and they're pretty.<br /><br />Well, that's not nothing! The company undersold the sheer joy of wearing gloves that are pretty, sensual and colorful. If feeling cold, I'd recommend you put them on and rub them all over someone warm.<br />That's their best use, in my opinion."
2.0,"Pretty fringe, fits a little odd but nice material."
2.0,"The strap looked great online.  However, since it's made of at least 2 layers of fabric, it had to be stitched together.  The top layer did not line up well, and exhibited some bunching, making it look really bad.  I returned it and picked up a D'Addario strap.  It wasn't much more money, but looks and feels way better."
2.0,i brought this dress in too colors red and blue one in a large and one in an extra large i normally wear a large and it fit tight around the breast on the large and the red one is not red its a hot pink color
2.0,"Very fun costume, but the want is VERY cheap.  Ours came bent."
2.0,This top had the potential to be cute but the sizing was ridiculously small. My head could barely fit through the hole. Disappointing.
2.0,I don't like the jersey material used. it sticks to the skin (clingy) and when I put my phone in the pocket it weighed down the whole dress (stretch it down a bit). i didn't like it much.
2.0,Too Small.  Really thin!
2.0,Not sparkly enough for me.was to flat to the finger.
2.0,"Strap broke right off within a few hours of wearing them. Sad, because they were cute and comfortable,  just very poorly made. Seller offered me 50% refund only reason they get two stars."
2.0,bought this for a church dress. was not prepared for how my behind looks in it
2.0,"Didnt fit right, I also don't like the folds on the side of the dress. Came without tags which was odd because the packaging says it must return with the tag still on, so i believe the dress was used"
2.0,"Boy shorts cut into my waist, causing a muffin top. The top was fitted, but not enough to hold in my tummy or muffin top. Tie at the top made the suit look cheap. I would eliminate the tie (cut it off!). Also the shorts gave no shaping, making an unflattering appearance from the back. However, the pattern is pretty. If you have a toned figure this may work for you."
2.0,"This item has the one big thing I was looking for and that is softness. It also does not pill. I would have easily given it five stars if it were not for one very big problem. It is a really dangerous one, so this review took a hit. It’s the zipper. The top right side of the zipper is razor sharp. I do mean razor sharp. It cut my husband’s finger and has scratched my neck. He wants to take a file and try to file it down. I think this hoodie is a recall item. Who knows, maybe a person who sews poorly put my zipper in, but they probably made more than one and there could be others like it out there. I cannot not recommend this hoodie."
2.0,"This was as a present for my mom for her birthday.  I always buy her pears.  The color is not blue but a typical black pear.  I was excited that to give her blue pearls, thought it would be different.  Too bad it was not as described."
2.0,"The helmet was quite small, but manageable. Three negative point I can think of is that...<br /><br />1. The painting was pretty bad. Shiny yes, but you can feel the texture or the dried part in some place. It wasn’t as smooth or glossy when seeing it in person or close up.<br /><br />2. The visor/tinted eye piece was horrible. You can feel or see the flimsiness and creased. Sorta like a sunglass thats made out of cheap plastic material. Hard to explain. Think window material for chocolate bunny box. Very thin and easily to bend or creased up. :-)<br /><br />3. Photo shows padding all around inside helmet, but reality, only had 2-3 pieces of sponge. The Helmet look like it made of paper maché<br /><br />Possitve: The helmet’s pretty solid. Had a little weight to it.<br /><br />P.S.<br />If you charge consumer $130+ for this, at least make it worth that much. I would be happy if I pay no more than $25.99 for it. :-( and would not return it the next day. Just saying. Hasbro charges their’s for $69 to $150. And it’s worth every penny on some of their helmets."
2.0,Mask is way too small for an adult. I tried to mess with the straps but the actual mask itself is pretty small also. Definitely meant for children!
2.0,These earrings were huge and not at all what I expected. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Don’t really like this, and it started to break with light wear. Sitting in the junk drawer now. Oh well."
2.0,Too tight in tummy area. Not flattering.
2.0,I recall my other Hue denim leggings being thicker and a a much nicer color. These are very blue.... I miss the old style.
2.0,They do not perform as advertised
2.0,"The band itself is nice, and I’ve had similar ones for my previous Fitbits, both Charge 2 and 3 which I loved. With the Charge 5 being newer, there were no reviews to peruse so I took a chance since I was familiar with the style and looks.  Like I said, the band is great. My reason for 2 stars is because it did not come with the REQUIRED resizing tool. Luckily, I had a resizing tool from my other band, but if you don’t have the resizing tool, the band is useless to you unless it fits perfectly as is…which is usually not the case.  Spend a few extra dollars and get one that confirms the resizing tool is included."
2.0,Not nearly as heavily made as original band loops.
2.0,Too thick wish they were not do dense
2.0,"Garbage paint, instantly starts to chip off as soon as removed from packaging. Given that this is a key-chain (and will, you know, hit off of keys and stuff while in your pocket) I can't imagine how the paint will hold up after even a few times in your pocket."
2.0,Dress did not fit - and color was more of a coral than red.
2.0,this product appeared comparable to a similar brand i bought on amazon  however looks are deceiving it was over sized and the quality was very much inferior I regret the purchase of two pairs.<br /><br />Lloyd
2.0,"Weird fit, returned it. Sorry I can't give more specifics as I returned it before documenting what was off about the fit."
2.0,"Cheap material, looks like a hospital gown"
2.0,Hood was put on backwards. I only have 2 stars because I recieved it fast.
2.0,We were not sent the adjustable closure shoes in the listing. The ones we got looked similar but neededed to be tied so we had to return them. Adjustable closure was a must for us. My son does really want red shoes so I ordered from another listing. Hopefully we can get when is in the photo.
2.0,Dead on  arrival. The watch did not work when I received it. The watch looked alright but wouldn't buy again.
2.0,Hole after first use
2.0,Pretty but turned my neck green in about a week
2.0,"Some of the pairs are size 10 as ordered, but others are size 7!!"
2.0,Was small in size
2.0,it's just too small.
2.0,It was ok. It I wouldn't buy it again either
2.0,Ordered a bigger size and it was still too small. I like the back and the color. If you have wide shoulders don't buy. Has poofy shoulders. Completely see though. Would recommend buying a undershirt.
2.0,Loved but wasnt sturdy at all.
2.0,"Item was not as described. The hat has a word embroidered on it and from the looks of the picture, you're led to believe you can lift the shield when you're not using it (if the middle button isn't buttoned.) It doesn't lift all the way. If you want to use it with the shield, you have to take it completely off and hold it. I wish it would life all the way so it would be multifunctional."
2.0,These felt poorly made very thin. I wouldn't order again
2.0,Is not what I expected
2.0,"Great dress, but it’s very thin and see through."
2.0,Did not come with bangle
2.0,Comfortable shoe.  First time I've ever bought nikes that feel so large.  It feels about 1/2 size too big.  I bought 7.5.  I normally wear exactly that size and on occasion an 8.
2.0,These are not an authentic brand. These are imitation. I can tell from the pic. Good price though
2.0,Well... it's super cute... wish it wasn't put together by one stitch. I went to put it over my shoulders and the whole right strap popped off. Luckily I can sew 'er back up. But... common now.
2.0,My son loves it but the material is on the cheaper side and the eye mesh fell out with in the first 24 hours.  I think it might be fore 5 or 10 dollars rather than 20.
2.0,"Everything is perfect ony lenth is very small, length should be 42” you sent 36”"
2.0,Way too small for an adult.
2.0,&#34;you get what you pay for&#34; was never more true than with this bead. It was cheap and looks cheap.
2.0,"These shoes seem promising when I purchased them.  I was very disappointed that these shoes don’t stay on and get super dirty so easily.  I regret buying them, save your money and don’t buy them."
2.0,This is simply a very lightweight silk scarf folded in half and would give zero protection to others or yourself so far as COVID-19 is concerned. My exhaled breath goes straight through.
2.0,"Now I realize these snap earrings are relatively cheap for what they are but after reading other reviews it seemed like they would be a great deal…not the case.<br />These are sloppily made, do not open/close without pinching, some dont open at all, and they discolored after one wear."
2.0,Wait for it to work
2.0,Bought these for the longer leg boxer style length. They are cut like regular girls underwear.
2.0,It's not true to size.
2.0,Awful! Bad fit. Look cheap and feel worse. Not unisex by any stretch of the imagination.
2.0,"Fits in the bust but is not long enough for comfort in the waist. The white &#34;sleeves&#34; fall to my elbows and will need to be altered. Also, the bow on the very front is crooked. I may have it removed and altered as well. The quality is poor but as expected having been shipped directly from China."
2.0,This ripped extremely easily and had holes in the bottom after a few wears.  The holes let the pens in my apron get ink on my jeans.
2.0,"I have 10 globes that have no match.  So, I need to have 5 more pairs that match sent to me and then I can return the 10 with no pair."
2.0,Umbrella is very flimsy. Bag feels cheap.
2.0,"I bought these for vacation and as soon as I washed them (in a delicates bag) on delicate, the lace was coming apart in several places. I couldn't send them back, as I was leaving for vacation right away. Not worth the money"
2.0,I love that way it looks and the fit is great but the clamp broke way to easy but luckily I was able to fix it no problem
2.0,Fit perfect but the seam starting coming apart 15 minutes after wearing it!  Thankfully I wore stockings but by the end of the night I didn’t have enough safety pins to keep the seam from unraveling up my behind and back!  Ended up in the trash bc I had already worn it and there was no saving it. WASTE OF MONEY.
2.0,So I ordered and was so excited when it was delivered promptly but looked at the bottoms and it broke my excitement immediately! The upper scrap was sewn into the waistline. Attempted to get a replacement and was told the request could not be completed!!
2.0,"These gloves are a big disappointment. They're comfortable, but only keep my hands warm when it's 25 ℉ or warmer. Any temps lower than that and my fingers get very cold. Also they rarely work on my iPhone touch screen. I'm looking for better/warmer gloves now."
2.0,"too small, sent back"
2.0,"This was too small in the bust and not even the design that's pictured.<br />I ordered a small, but it fit everywhere else.<br />I'm 5'4&#34;, 130lbs, 32D."
2.0,"Sadly after owning many Seiko's this watch was a let down.The Crown pulled out and the Watch wouldnt work after hours in the Sun,wont buy another Solar Watch so I returned it unworn,wish it was better packed arrived in a  envelope with no padding,very expensive for a Seiko but I like the looks about it.Dont quite understand the Solar therory but living in Florida one would think it would charge quick,60 hours of sunlight and the hands didnt move.The Crown wobbled when pulled to the third notch and could easily pull out.This Model is ""too busy""with all the colors of the dial,hands etc."
2.0,"I ordered one size up; however, they were still too small."
2.0,"Tight! It fits but the top of the dress has no stretch when trying to get it on, it's not a flexible material."
2.0,"I bought the white one and I love it, so I bought it in black. The black one feels like it was stitched wrong. The stitch on the right side comes forward to the front and I have to keep twisting it back then it gets tight on the left side. I would like to exchange it. I will try to do that..."
2.0,Fades away really fast!
2.0,"Pretty, but way too small. They are being returned."
2.0,Did not like the fabric.  Not tight enough like a swimsuit should be.
2.0,Color tended to be more Orange than red
2.0,This item is not the same as pictured. Poor quality plastic flat earings. The necklace I recieved is not the one pictured.
2.0,I looked silly with these on. The plastic frames were sturdy but my problem was the nose bridge width which was too small so it made my face look huge. Returned.
2.0,"Too small I got an extra large which is my usual size and it was very snug around the bottom.  The fabric is much heavier then it looks however I really loved the shoulder cutouts, the color, and length of the top. Unfortunately I will be returning this top since it is too snug on me."
2.0,look cheap and fall down easily
2.0,After first wash it shrinks 50%
2.0,"The shirt itself is very nice and the burgundy is very vivid but not blinding, and would be a good match with different summer outfits. So why only two stars? The XL is more like a medium, which is too bad as I was looking forward to wearing it. Unless you are fairly slim, not muscular and don't mind the really short sleeves and the way it doesn't give then DON'T buy it. The sizing chart did not show anything when I checked it but I took a chance and lost. I should have listened to the reviewers before me."
2.0,I wear a medium and with these it is uncomfortably tight. I even bought a set of large and again tight. I have different pairs of this brand but I cannot even wear these. It's as if little boys or people with zero butt are the only ones whom can wear.
2.0,It broke in a day 😠
2.0,Necklace is nice but very light weight does not look expensive.
2.0,"Better than a bandana but the fit sucks!!! Hangs down to my middle neck! If you have a really long face and big chin they might be ok. Made in China, cheap fabric and poor fit. Filters are paper. I thought that I was buying a mask like my son bought but definitely not same quality as his (also bought on Amazon) so these are cheap knockoffs. Disappointed because of the fit and poor construction."
2.0,Doesn’t stay on the head
2.0,Returning this because it left a blue ring around my wrist.
2.0,I realize it’s under $10.00 but if it breaks within minutes of wearing it is useless even if it’s free. My daughter was very excited and even put a few strands of her dogs hair in the locket so she could be with her the first day of 5th grade today. Too bad the chain is junk and broke. She couldn’t wear it. Lesson learned. In my haste I didn’t read the reviews. Lesson learned. Now I will confirm what the reviews stated. Junk chain. They are all going to break because the links of the necklace aren’t fused together. They all will break if there’s a slight bit of movement. My daughter being so upset prompted me to hurry and let others know.
2.0,Is nice but the material is very cheap. After 2monthss of wear it started to have bumps and looking old
2.0,"I'm very disappointed with this sweater.  It does not look like the sweater on the model as the neck is droopy and way too big, as well as the overall fit is way too big and loose. Looks sloppy.  I do not like the fabric.  I feel like I'm wearing a rug.  I should never have ordered the color black as every piece of lint, etc. finds it way onto this sweater making it look terrible. I'm not returning, but will try to make use of it."
2.0,The priniting on the watch was crooked and off
2.0,"This hat is too small; fit is way too tight.  I have a small size head, so this hat might not even go on some heads.  Hat is cute, lining is nice and warm but unfortunately not comfortable to wear."
2.0,I didn’t like the fit. It fit weird on me. One can adjust the sizing but it still was odd fitting and uncomfortable. Felt like it would fall off. Maybe this hat was too big on me (even after adjusting.) the hat is pretty and I liked the feel of it and material.
2.0,It’s pretty but runs way too small.
2.0,Ok quality for the price but one pair arrived rusty
2.0,Best didn’t come with the white the north face logo. Name is as color of vest.
2.0,I didn’t like that after one wash I could no longer wear it out the house . It is now a house dress.
2.0,This is a nice key ring but it is pretty poor quality assurance when someone did not even take the time to confirm that the ring on the product would actually fit properly into the hole on the Dodge key fob. It's pretty sad when you have to replace the nice ring that comes on it because it is not a proper fit for the item it was intended for. I expected  a little more out of $15 key ring.
2.0,"This top is okay, it washes well. It's not really form-fitting like in the photo with the model - maybe I ordered too large."
2.0,"It did not look as good on as it did in,the pictures"
2.0,Go up a size! I bought a large because I usually wear around a size 12 shirt but it was too small.
2.0,Too heavy for me. Haven't worn because of that.
2.0,"ok for the price, stitching was a bit sloppy"
2.0,"Beautiful earrings, but broke on second wear"
2.0,Fits just like a tight skull cap: there no room for any hair.
2.0,Do not work with my glasses. Still fogs up my glasses plus very heavy and hot
2.0,"Wasn't a fan of the dress when it arrived, the material was stiff and didn't wear well."
2.0,"Ordered a 12-13(B) US for my husband. They are marked as a 40-41, which is nowhere near a 12-13 in men’s or women’s. They’re smaller than my own size 9 women’s sandals.<br /><br />Otherwise, they seem like decent house shoes."
2.0,"Great key chain, but the coating on this does not last and started chipping the day I started using it. you can see in other posts with photos how it chips"
2.0,"Bought it for the pretty coral color, but it has a lot of blue in it. Cheap, rough cut edges without any stitching on the wrap part. Haven't put it on, forgot to return while I had the chance."
2.0,these tarnished right away
2.0,"1st wash, washed I side out and when came from washer the whole picture had faded.."
2.0,The material on the inside has already ripped and I've only used it maybe 4-5 months
2.0,"This looked so cute when I took it out of the package, but after I washed and dried it, it became very wrinkled. The sleeves are shorter than they appear in the picture and it felt more like a sleeveless nightgown. Not a fan."
2.0,The mechanism to close the umbrella did not work properly. I returned it.
2.0,This thing is trash it’s small and thin nylon please don’t waste your money
2.0,"I would only recommend buying this if your nose is narrow, if you have a wide nose it's completely unnoticeable.  For example I'm not even supposed to wear it at my job but I do because my manager can barely see it. And until you get the hang of it, is extremely difficult to snap open and closed! But still kinda cute."
2.0,Way too much material.
2.0,It was really cute and would've been perfect if not damaged. I received it with one snap not attached to fabric but attached to other snap (if that makes any sense). I may have been able to repair but I felt like the other one may come unattached as well and I shouldn't have to fix something I've never worn. Hopefully mine was not the norm
2.0,"When they say WINTER SOCK they must mean some tropical area winter sock.  They're not bad socks, but they're to thin for what I'd call a winter sock."
2.0,A nylon / spandex compression sock is better fit that delivers even compression than heavy cotton sock - even if 2X cost
2.0,The design was so pretty so I was sad to return it. I normally wear a Large and ordered a Large. The skirt waist was so small I could not even put it on. I should have read some of the reviews and sized up at least 2 sizes.
2.0,"Nice style, but the fabric is very cheap and piles.  Plus buttons have fallen off after  only a month...  Get what you pay for."
2.0,The buckle broke in about a month.  I do not recommend.
2.0,This dress is not flattering at all.  The material is not cotton it feels like a microfiber.  I would joy our haze again.  The dress looks very different than what the model is wearing it lays different.
2.0,Color changed and made my septum feel infected!!
2.0,"The wires in these are not round, but actually flat. That could fine if it wasn't for the fact that they are so big that they don't fit in my various key fobs."
2.0,"Only giving 2 stars because it is decent quality and I think sizing is spot on. However, I didn't not receive anything remotely close to the picture/description provided. Top and bottom do not match. So disappointed. I'm gonna order it again and see if the outcome changes. Will update once new item received."
2.0,These did not last a month.
2.0,"These necklaces seem fairly well made, but the gold tone is a dark orange-yellow amber and clashes with my other gold jewelry.  It's fake and garish looking.  The photos on the models are misleading, and make both chains appear fairly thin.  The other photos are more accurate in showing the thickness of the chains.  They come with a surprisingly thick, high quality ivory velvet pouch."
2.0,"I purchased this suit to fit my top half 36DD I read the reviews and purchased a large. Although the top is long, it does have drawstrings on each side and can be adjusted to fit perfect. The bottoms however, are more like an XXL. I will keep the top because it fits beautifully and is made with high quality material. The cheap bottoms will be going to the Goodwill."
2.0,the fabric is very heavy. stains become very difficult to remove
2.0,These boots run right on the size but are not like pictured. I returned these boots. Not worth the price asked for.
2.0,"It’s a great product, but I received the wrong size."
2.0,"Love the size and color, mobility is good. The product is not very well put together. The first set the top handle broke in its first trip to Chicago, this set was replaced. Car trips were fine as was the next air trip with the new set. The very next airtrip killed the suitcase again, the side handle popped loose when the shuttle driver picked it up, the handle was entirely gone when arrived in Phoenix upon return home the top handle was dangling and a set of wheels was missing. Very disappointed"
2.0,They broke I didn't even get to wear them!
2.0,"after a month of waiting on them, extremely disappointed.  I couldn't get them on even after unfolding the cuff.  They were cute but not worth the work of struggling to get into them.  I'm a slip them on and go type of person and if takes more than a half a min to get into both shoes, forget it.<br />I gave them to my niece who's foot is narrower and she got into them just fine."
2.0,Nothing over an A cup would fit this; zero structure ; horrible shape
2.0,Too small. Stayed lit up for maybe two months after purchase? And they weren't just left on either. Maybe this type of thing is fairly new and they will come out with better ones. Son was happy at first but ended up breaking them and lost the battery. May get another pair but will definitely read reviews first! ;)
2.0,"I wanted to love this, but it fell flat for me.  It was too form fitting, and not as soft as I expected.  Soft is key for me. Did not look as pictured."
2.0,The medium is Way to large
2.0,Very short fit.
2.0,"Despite washing and using fabric softeners; these socks are just too itchy to wear! The thread for the gold is really rough. Disappointing, because they are cute."
2.0,"Very pretty, a little heavy. I returned due to the closure being too tight on my earlobes. They pinched and hurt, not worth it to suffer through."
2.0,"I was very disappointed in the durability of these shorts.  I bought a couple of these for my husband for Father's Day, and already last month both pair were ripped just below the zipper.  They tore, actually, so there was nothing that could be repaired.  I had to throw them out.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"What can you expect from  a $15 dress? 🤷🏽‍♀️ Lol. I have been obsessed about the Pretty Little Thing corset and skirt set that had been floating around social media for months now. When I saw there was a dress style and I didn’t have to necessarily buy it from Shein, I was excited. The dress actually arrived earlier than expected and fit me despite 3XL is the equivalent to a size 12 maybe a size 14. There is some stretch but the quality is poor. There is ZERO support in the bust. My boobs barely fit the cups and just hang awkwardly underneath/to the sides. Boob tape can’t even fit this. If the top part had some type of boning or made similar to a corset, the dress may would have fit a little better. The straps looked as if they were a few wears away from ripping. This is still a cute dress that you could wear out. Just make sure you have no plans on moving too much or dropping it low on the dance floor. Imagine your tata’s tumbling out and you have to quickly gather then then run away from embarrassment. You can’t even look like the moment in this dress. I guess it can be some sort of sexy lingerie at best smh."
2.0,"5'3&#34; @ 115lbs and the small was a little too big. The back had slack and would hang open. The material is a little thin and light weight, but not see thru. The dress sent had a sewing defect so it is being returned."
2.0,"I kept it as I can wear it in the house however, it’s tighter then description and size chart shows so.. go up.. but it can make this work for chill out house wear."
2.0,ring is to small
2.0,"We got the 2, my daughter is now in 4t clothes and the 2 was huge, wish made a little smaller for my wedding at end of month"
2.0,"The material is nice and as expected with little flaws of material hanging out when it has been sewn. But nothing you can't cut. My BIG disappointment is I search ALL robes and specifically wanted them with good length, pockets and inside tie and they DO NOT have pockets or inside tie. I would of never purchased these if I knew that. The retailer should correct the detail description of these robes to not falsely advertise what you are really getting. The price was the best part so I'm looking for robes that have pockets and inside ties and if I can't find them I will stick with these as they are not bad besides missing those details."
2.0,Go sizes up
2.0,I got this about two months ago and the fake leather or material is already peeling from the handles.
2.0,"This shirt is not made right. It feels like a pajama shirt when you’re wearing it. According to the picture it was to be short sleeve, but it is long sleeves.<br /><br />Material is very soft and I like that."
2.0,"The colors were fine. I ordered 2 the same size. They fit different. The arms are a lot longer on one. Poor quality, not worth the sale price"
2.0,Really tiny but guess I’ll keep for a keep sake
2.0,One size does not fit all just FYI
2.0,Worked great for my watch but didn't last long at all. Came part quickly.
2.0,"Mask was awesome but after first time I had to charge it, it would not work and when it did work leds had died so my text was missing parts. Super cool at first I haven't tried asking the company anything so this review is only based on my current feelings and probably doesn't reflect them as a company just giving a heads up"
2.0,"The fabric is very thin , and bot the best quality.  Threads are falling apart .<br />The top fits really fit, but the skirt fits fine. Just seems like the sizing is off ."
2.0,Very pretty but cheap and does not stay on. Very disappointed in the product.
2.0,Returns are not allowed morni wound have returned. Lenses are heavy and almost look mirrored - not like photo. Will not be wearing them so was a total waste of money. Gave 2 stars because quality of frame portion was good. For reference I have 5 pairs of blue blocker glasses so I knew what to expect.
2.0,"First time using this socks an gloves.  They do not slide at all, but they do hurt in between my fingers and toes because it pulls when I stretch. I it may be just me, but I cant use them if they hurt."
2.0,"The product works well, but it is not tear resistant. If you train hard and vigorous, it will tear."
2.0,"Title says it all - meaningful bracelet, but a bugger to close with one hand. The snaps are not aligned well from the manufacturer, so your always going to have one with a button loose, or unsnapped. Too bad!"
2.0,The  claaps are too big to go through my bails.  I have to take each one apart to use.  Very time consumming.
2.0,Runs small and rolls
2.0,The neck is sooo long. I had to fold in half and hem. The dress itself it very thin and runs large.
2.0,Don't waste money .. Put some more money and buy some nice pair of sunglasses.
2.0,"I usually buy smalls in everything but since putting on a little Covid Cushion, I went with the medium.  They fall right off without even being unbuttoned and the ankle area doesn't taper as the photo appears to show.  too much hassle to return, so yardwork jeans only now.  bummed"
2.0,The style is nice but this sweater started pulling right away… I wouldn’t buy it again.
2.0,"Purse was ridiculously small, pretty color but had to send it back as it was child size"
2.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and wear a size 10 -- but this dress in an XL was way too small for me. And it's not worth the price to send it back to China (it didn't even come with a receipt, even if I wanted to send it back). So don't order this dress unless you're a smaller person than me. I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"It's more like a costume than a dress -- trim began to unravel exposing frayed lines and there's no way to fix it.  But my granddaughter enjoyed the wings and pretending to fly as well as the the cute unicorn hat.  If you're thinking this is a ""pageant outfit"" as described by seller you will be very disappointed.  Price is too high."
2.0,It's a really small top. I wore it but was really tight for XL. Using XL is really baggy the fit was quite tight.
2.0,"Too big, I couldn't even keep it on my wrist."
2.0,Shorts fit larger then the top. Top runs narrow. Collar on the top came apart first washing. To bad because it is very cute.
2.0,"I purchased this backpack because it was called &#34;heavy duty.&#34;  I have to use a clear bag daily for work.  It has NOT held up well, and the seams are already tearing after a couple weeks worth of use.  I will not be purchasing another one of this style."
2.0,The material is not soft like I hoped.
2.0,Good feel and fit but didn't last long. This happened after my 3rd time wearing them. Sucks.
2.0,When these arrive 2 came with broken points that need to be rewarded.  The rest had bends in the filigree so I had to flatten them out before I could use them.
2.0,Way too see-through.
2.0,"Too loose at the wrist, too tight through the upper arm.  I found it uncomfortable and pretty much unwearable."
2.0,Motor started making noise after two weeks. I had to put it in another room so i couldn't hear it.
2.0,Too light and look cheap
2.0,"the cut of these pants are too tight in the crotch, not nearly as comfortable as they looked. Also the fabric is not very soft, I purchased thinking soft like flannel but the material is more like.. cheap bed sheets that are new and starchy. washing didn't help."
2.0,I think they feel small because the 'waistband free' allows the pantyhose to inch down while I wear them.  I'm a size 6/8 and I purchase the size a and size b.  Both do the same thing.  My body style is  curvy. So maybe it's just me.
2.0,"Was hoping these would work out for basic gardening yard work boot, but it was too tight (even ordered 1/2 size larger per reviews) but it was too narrow and tight on the upper laceded area.  Also the quality of construction appeared pretty weak especially the holders for the lace.  Probably would break after regular use."
2.0,WAY WAY TOO SMALL! The size chart is wrong by two full sizes. If you search for European shoe chart online you’ll find the real size conversions. Very disappointing as they are now full price ($55) and unavailable in most sizes.
2.0,"For some reason these were so tiny, I've bought the same size at Spencer's and hot topic and they fit a lot better than these."
2.0,Really small and the sleeves were not as pictured.
2.0,"Although its a nice jacket, it runs very small! 3x fit more like a US Large"
2.0,very dull
2.0,Loved the look of this band but very disappointed that I couldn’t get it tight enough and it would slip. I don’t wear it.
2.0,Sizes are way off. Xxl is like a medium
2.0,"You get what you pay for. The order was accurate and shipping was fast but I was very disappointed when I saw the product. It is cheap looking and not as authentic looking as the picture. I'm pretty sure it will turn my sister's finger green and bend if she knocks it on anything. Lesson learned, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."
2.0,These are pretty earrings but please be careful because while i was putting them on I cut the crap out of my finger trying to close the clasp. Very sharp and could be dangerous for a young girl.
2.0,"These were fine, but cheap. They started getting gaping holes in them, and I didn’t wear them nearly as much as I could have and I only wore them inside. My biggest pet peeve with these were the Pom poms actually. I couldn’t put my legs under me with them on because the Pom poms hurt my ankle. I ended up cutting them off with scissors, and just getting new slippers. I wouldn’t buy them again."
2.0,I was really excited for these to come in but they look terrible. They fit at the waist but the legs are huge and baggy.
2.0,turns your skin green
2.0,There was a white mark/line on it when I received it. The quality did not match the price.
2.0,I originally ordered a large.  Then ordered an extra large to compare.  They were EXACTLY the same size.  They simply just put different size labels in them.
2.0,Very cute shoes. I was very excited for my baby boy to try them on but had to wait couple monhs since they were a little to big. He has worn them about 4-5 times and the strap came completely off from the velcro. I would love a replacement of them since they looked pretty comfy on lightweighted on my son but return window closed since he didn't start using them till two months after they arrived.
2.0,"I returned , was too large and dry cleaner only"
2.0,Broke within 30 days
2.0,It was much smaller than expected
2.0,"The 'standard fit' did not fit most of my glasses. The one pair it did fit was super-tight and super-hard to get on, so my intention to take the croakies on and off whenever I want is not practical. Just seems like their template that they make/sew them must be too small a diameter. I used to have croakies years ago and they were really good. I wish I had my old ones here in front of me so I could compare. But yeah, my guess is they are now made to a smaller diameter template and are close to useless unless used with glasses that have a &#34;paperclip-wire&#34; diameter sized ear-pieces. I am going to have to buy another product to fulfill the need I have to have the wind not blow the glasses off my face when I drive with the windows down. And if they work for you I apologize but they were not as useful as my old ones from years ago."
2.0,"For as cheap as it is, a bit overpriced. Needed for a very quick costume and they worked fine but could probably make a better set."
2.0,Fell apart after the very first use.... i really liked how they looked...
2.0,"These shoes are as cute as can be, but they smell terrible. I read reviews of them having a “chemical smell”, but I chalked it up to it being a review from someone who is overly cautious about chemicals. I was so wrong. They smell horrid. I’ve set them outside for two weeks to “air out” and have sprayed them with Lysol, wiped with Clorox wipes, and nothing has helped the smell. If you can deal with the smell and still want to order, make sure to get at lease one size up."
2.0,"We order Champion Vapor Knit Shorts from this seller. The limited product reviews seemed to indicate it should be ok. What we received was a cheaper pair of generic jersey shorts, not at all of the same material or sewn the same. Checked the seller reviews and (70%, which is not good) and this seems to be a common practice of getting something different and cheaper than what was ordered.  You are rolling the dice. Buyer beware."
2.0,"I got the black and white dot printed dress. The pattern is very cute, but this is a two piece dress, which I don't believe is in the description and I didn't see in any reviews. The material is a bit slippery, so the skirt part of the dress doesnt feel secure and it feels as though the top portion could get pulled out/look disheveled. I would much prefer if it was all one piece, I think it would be much more flattering. Sending this back."
2.0,.The silver started to wear off. you can see its copper ..SO DISAPPOINTED!! I CAN ONLY WEAR SILVER OR GOLD.  THIS WAS GOING TO BE MY NEW FAVORITE RING..
2.0,"I hate this fabric! It's very plasticky and does not breathe well at all. I'm no polyester hater – I usually prefer synthetic or semisynthetic fabrics – but this does not have good airflow and I feel sweaty in it in no time.<br /><br />Design wise, it does work well for nursing. The neckline is just low enough to enable comfortable nursing, though snaps would be easier than buttons. Sleeves are too short, though I'm taller than average (5'8"") so YMMV."
2.0,These were sooo pretty loved the colors but had to return because they are just waaay to big. Much bigger than they appear in the pictures.
2.0,"Opened my box today to find book marks that are much smaller than those that I've ordered from other suppliers for this style. They also are already beginning to tarnish almost as if moisture was trapped in the bag they arrived in. Upsetting seeing as how I wanted to use these to make bookmarks for my gift shop, but can't see selling them to my customers of they're already tarnished and haven't even been used yet... won't be buying these again."
2.0,I sized you getting a medium and it was still very short on me.
2.0,Pendant is chunky and looks cheap
2.0,Love the style. Doesn’t wash well
2.0,Color wasn't what i expected and it was too large for my liking. Too bad to its a nice leather and good compartments
2.0,This item is not the normal sweatshirt fabric. It's a synthetic fabric with a shiny finish and not breathable.<br />The print was not centered (too low).<br />The 3x size is equivalent to a U.S. large size.
2.0,Cheep looking never wore it.  You get what you pay for on this one.
2.0,"It didn't look like the picture, didn't  have that antique look. It looked as if it came from the 99 cent store."
2.0,This sweater is SO SHORT. It’s much more cropped than it looks in the photo
2.0,Starting to change colors.  Have not have it 2 months yet and the string is too light for the heaviness of the necklace.  The string has broken to an irreparable status.
2.0,"I looked very carefully at the size chart before ordering these. It says: XL (18-20 Years):Waist(31.8""),Hips(38.5""), Length( 39.7""), which should have fit big as they needed to fit a 25"" waist. Could barely get them on and WAY too tight, unwearable. I'd recommend sizing up at least two sizes, although in this case I simply had to find a different pair."
2.0,I gave this away.
2.0,Looked great but fell apart within 2 weeks.
2.0,This shirt is way too small. I think it is a kids size. I wear a L/XL and ordered up because of the very small size chart listing.  I ordered a XXL and it is about the size of a M. The material is also very thin.
2.0,"Product quality is ok BUT....ithe description states, medium glasses, BS...this has the capacity to hold very narrow and flat lenses. Other than the misleading description, it is a hard case that will protect lenses, IF they can fit in it."
2.0,Material does not stretch and it shrinks
2.0,It is cute but not for Daith piercing because the points of the star is too small.
2.0,"I'm familiar with &#34;no show&#34; socks, but these did not cover the top of my feet. Its like a weird liner, and it made me uncomfortable inside, almost creeped me out. What of shoes are they expecting me to wear with these??"
2.0,"Will not stay on my face, how to use spirit gum to keep them on."
2.0,The shorts are alittle longer than I expected and they bunch up along the top not very comfortable.
2.0,It was too small and the material was very thin.
2.0,The shoe bed fit as expected however the ankle strap was huge. Way out of proportion for the shoe size. The ankle strap fit around an adult leg with room. We sent it back
2.0,I returned these because they were way too small and did not feel like good quality.
2.0,Returned<br />size is too big
2.0,I’ve gone accustomed to some of the knock off material but this takes the cake! Color looks nothing like the photo and the sizing chart is just a tad bit off. I bought a large but a medium would have been hands down better. I bought one in black too.<br /><br />They certainly did get the design down but you can even see the black lace through the belt loop. Just a little bit bad quality material.
2.0,"Did not like the fabric, it is silky and thin. Would not purchase again."
2.0,"I got these in a size 11, and am 5'9&#34; the foot was way large, and the calf was too snug and too short for me. It felt as if they used a different sized foot for upsizing, but neglected to scale up the shank."
2.0,This watch tool opener case wrench will not open my watch case.  Shipper is good but the wrench will not open the back of my watch.
2.0,I actually like the blk & gray tanks. The white one however came with stains all over it that I cannot get out no matter how hard I try.
2.0,"The one reason why I got this was the zap feature to wake me up. Having to wake others to my alarms is a drag for them so I decided to get this. The device is cheap looking and the band definetly will not last long. The app is down right awful. For what they are charging for the watch should reflect in at least a decent app.<br /><br />Watch<br />Pro:<br />-seems durable<br />-one full charge lasted me for a week<br />-will give you a good zap to wake you up<br />up<br />-I guess it can be used to fix habits but its misleading.<br />Cons:<br />-cheap band<br />-the device itself is cheap and clunky looking.<br />-holds a terrible connection with the app<br />-absolutely no manual. Seriously I get its 2019 but at least have a manual that comes with it. I can buy a $20 toy drone that has more features than this watch and it will come with a manual.<br /><br />App:<br />Pro:<br />-has a multitude of feature for setting alarms. Zap, beep, and vibration. Multiple times can be set. Has options to zap you if you press snooze, have to perform jumping Jack's to stop alarm.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-for me it's very cheap looking. At least stick with a pleasant color scheme.<br />-has features in it that don't make sense. I get you are trying to help with habits but that's what a trained and certified professional is for...focus on the UI and usability because it's very lack luster for a $150 device.<br />-if something is in beta just don't put it in...I paid a good amount of money for this and you are telling me these things are in beta...ouch<br />-video and sound is low quality and unnecessary for the tutorial.<br />-when I have the watch connected the app alone uses the second most amount of my battery...an unnecessary amount to put it bluntly.<br /><br />To be honest I would not recommend this to anyone unless you absolutely need to wake up without a loud alarm. Leave the habit fixing to professionals do not depend on a finicky app and an overpriced electric shock toy to fix your habit. Right now there is nothing that's like it to compete with which is why I ended up buying this with the help of amazon points.<br /><br />Overall great idea and concept but very poor execution."
2.0,"OK, I read the size chart thoroughly along with the description AND I read the answers that people gave. Based on that, I bough the 11 year old boy a size Large bc he's a big boy and those are the size dimensions that would fit him. We received the item and not only was a GIGANTIC enough for a grown man to wear it, but it had a brown smudge on the front because it was dirty! Disgusting. And a waste of time. Was supposed to be a bday gift, but now I'm gonna have to make time to run around to return it PLUS I don't have a suitable bday gift. I do this all the time and usually have very positive experiences with my amazon online purchases. But this was not good at all."
2.0,Bottom is not same shape as picture. Was disappointed by shape.
2.0,I'm a size 14 and this was way too small
2.0,"1) Shirt and pant dont have the save size. My shirt was OK but the pant was TOO small and tight.<br />2) The fabric has of poor quality, the part where are the buttons is fraying and this pijama has only been washed by hand and dried outdoors<br />3) When I communicated with the seller and talk about the problem #1, she said she was going to resend a new pant bigger, and it never happen (it has been 3 months or more)"
2.0,"Loved it at first, but a month in and it changed colors to old nasty looking...."
2.0,Horrible style. Not a high Impact bra! Band not tight at all. Disappointment
2.0,"They are very comfortable, but very thin. I bought them for work, but am using them for PJ bottoms."
2.0,Was a last min outfit for my son's school. It didn't hold up long.  Started to rip like 2hrs into wearing it
2.0,I was little disappointed with fit of the shirt.  Definitely runs small.  I usually wear a medium in women's tops and that is what I ordered--should have ordered a large.  I also must not have read clearly that the material is like polyester because to me it looked like a cotton blend.
2.0,Works fine if you buy extra extensions on the back. Figure at least 3&#34; smaller in size than it says. I usually am a 36 ordered a 38 and still had to add another extension
2.0,"i loved my last ping cap, it was all cotton, and sleekly shaped. this one is all synthetic, and more importantly even though the band fits around my head just right, the top of the cap is big and bulbous, looking just a bit like a big bubble. my last cap got compliments but this one is dorky looking"
2.0,The bra in this is so tiny compared to the actual shirt. It also doesn't show any of your back like the picture. The top of the shirt meets the bottoms of the sports bra. It is super uncomfortable. Very disappointed.
2.0,I did not keep this. The fabric is too thin.
2.0,The picture on this feels like a large piece of rubber attached to a t shirt. It will not be comfortable and I would return it if I could. 😞
2.0,"This bag is larger than expected, more of a rectangle shape and the color is darker, more like a navy blue. I was disappointed because I wanted a trimmer bag and  the brighter blue in the photo."
2.0,They seem a lot bigger in person.
2.0,too bulky to be a clutch
2.0,We bought these for Thanksgiving and most of them broke the first time we put them on.
2.0,Came disfigured!!!
2.0,Looks adorable in after the struggle to get it in place but unfortunately after 2 days in it started to really pinch and irritate so it needs removed. It was actually starting to pierce my nose on its on and I still haven't been able to remove it. Used two needle nose pliers and was able to pull it to a point that it's not hurting but it may need to be cut out.
2.0,"The style is adorable but this dress is Incredibly cheap in its makeup,  and see through. I personally wouldn’t recommend wearing out of the house. Also I felt it was disproportionately long. I sent it back"
2.0,"Fit is good, but the touch area for phones does not work."
2.0,small in the arms
2.0,this suit started to droop like curtains after a month! the cups in the bust is goofy small and not well placed. the straps also stretch a bit right away. I have only worn this for 6 weeks and it looks 3 years old!
2.0,Not black tourmaline. It's onyx
2.0,Seam Threads were already unraveling straight out of the package.
2.0,I bought this mask because I was traveling on an airplane.  Well the airlines won't let you wear these types of masks because of the holes that the air comes through.  That was also why I bought it. SO I could actually breathe.  I did use the mask when I went to the grocery store and the airflow worked great BUT it doesn't fit my smaller face.  The whole thing is larger than any other masks I have (cloth and disposable) and the nose piece is so stiff that it cannot be pinched to fit across my nose. I will keep it and maybe my husband will use it.  I would not recommend
2.0,It wasn’t stretchable as I wanted
2.0,"This pin is brightly colored and very cute. I was disappointed by imperfections, however. Please refer to my photo. Three of the eight letters in &#34;game over&#34; are messed up, and a scratch on the orange stripe reveals the light blue underneath. It's quite possible this was just a fluke and most of the pins are as nice as pictured."
2.0,The product material and design was far from expected.
2.0,"The quality of the dress was not even worth the price. In the picture, they advertise a darker shade of green, and that is not what I received. I give it a two star because the style of the dress is still accurate to the picture but you will definitely need to tailor."
2.0,"It’s really cute, but it is wayyyy too big and not adjustable."
2.0,I could not wear runs very small and doesn't really stretch much
2.0,"I bought these to combat swelling in my leg after foot surgery. The socks were nice, but they were so tight that I couldn't even get them over my toe to pull them up.  I am returning them today."
2.0,I liked the pastel color despite I didn’t see any yellow really. The earring backs did not stay on so I had to use some off other pair of earrings
2.0,"Good whilst they lasted. After the 2 month mark, the hinges became very loose, causing the not to fit correctly. Shame as I liked them."
2.0,The watch was much smaller than the previous watch with the same model number. It had to be returned.
2.0,I did not like that it has a lot of strings coming off and a tear in the side within a day. Not good quality and the shipping took forever.
2.0,"I was disappointed with these workout tights.  They fit fine, but easily snag and worst of all....sweat runs down the back and leaves an ugly butt sweat stain that is really embarrassing."
2.0,"Nice quality, but very narrow.  It would work much better on a child or teen."
2.0,"I didnt read Nylon and Spandex, but i really dont like the material it doesnt breathe... not healthy for your Va-Jay"
2.0,Gave to my kids for school they are in 1st & Pre-k. the plug on the top of the lid has broken off of two bottles already. Leaks very easily.
2.0,This hat will look just fine hung on the wall or on a hat rack.  I like the thought of using it for a flower pot.
2.0,I ordered the biggest size because I'm recovering from surgery and need the pants to be loose. They were so small in the waist that I can't get them past my knees and they're size XXL. I gave them to my daughter who usually buys a size M.
2.0,"Not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it. Mask came vacuumed sealed which means it has wrinkles all over the fabric and velcro that will not come out. No adjustment options for the strap that goes around the ear to secure it better. Buttons for the vents pop out often. Since you can't adjust the ear loops that means all of the pressure goes from the next velcro to the nose ""clip"". That clip is plastic which means you can't really tighten it to the top of your nose. That means that it inevitable slides down and closes your nostrils if you are running making breathing through your nose nearly impossible. I had to take it off after a few minutes and go back to a simple cloth mask to finish my workout.<br /><br />Less comfortable than the disposable masks. Other than looking interesting this is not a good mask..."
2.0,One of the earrings has a kink in it.  Item was shipped in a velvet pouch so I am not aware whether this happened in delivery or if the item was packaged in its damaged state.
2.0,The snap on earring doesn’t stay closed.
2.0,I ordered it for my 8 year old son. And they fit too small. Might fit a 3-4 year old better. They look pretty cool and the case is cute but they are more of a toddler size. The sides open out when he wears them.
2.0,"They are more like a pair of tights than leggings.  VERY thin.  I ordered a large/extra large and the size is more like a small/medium.  Disappointed, as most clothing I order from Amazon is true to size.  The only 'thing' that I say good, is the print is nice."
2.0,"I am a big fan of Not Your Daughter's Jeans. I love the slim look and control. I was excited to try these pants as a casual work day option. These pants are made of a mid-weight soft stretchy knit fabric. They feel GREAT on, like pajama pants almost. These do have the LiftXTuck Technology panel in the front, though combined with the midweight fabric, the panel doesn't really control my jiggles like I expected.. I think these pants would be great if they were made with the thick stretch denim that NYDJ is famous for. The inseam also runs a bit short. These are a bit longer than capri, but shorter than my other crop pants. I ordered the size 12 petite. The waist measures: 37"" / hips: 44"" / rise: 12"" / inseam: 26"""
2.0,I am a size 12 and the XL was too small. The fabric is light. Product did not have ruffles in the same place as model/picture.
2.0,"The dress was beautiful, But too small!! Really takes you back to the 50's and 60's I had to return😞"
2.0,The color is much more of a pink than peach
2.0,My daughter is 4'8&#34; ... we ordered the small and it was waaaayyyyy to big!!
2.0,"I bought these for my wife, they tarnished and turned rose gold color within 2 weeks.  I would not recommend these"
2.0,Shirt was about two sizes smaller than other t-shirts. Order accordingly.  The materials were high quality just smaller than expected.
2.0,Cheap material and cheap foam..bra cups are kinda stiff
2.0,"Such a cute dress, but much smaller than expected in waist hips and chest."
2.0,I bought Titanium so that it would hold up to wear. I find it hard to believe that this band is titanium because after a week at work as a nurse it's all scuffed and scratched.
2.0,"Cute style, color is as expected, however just too large. Will be returning. Hood is very thin too."
2.0,I wished it would not tear around my thumb area. Otherwise it would last longer at work.<br />Won't be ordering again.
2.0,"Not what l expected, it is not stretch and is too small for the size."
2.0,"It has a nice loose fit, but sleeves are too tight and fabric has no stretch. So it’s uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"I didn't like it, I don't know if is because I hate that sticky part on my nipples and I get itchy. I ordered a D cup which is the same size I buy vras from Victoria secret, however this bra didn't fit all around my breasts.<br /><br />I do believe the other reviews about loosing the stickiness because it started to get loose after a couple minutes of wearing it."
2.0,"The color is very one dimensional, mostly blue, not like the pic. Looks flat like a shrinks dink, which is ok for a kid but not adult."
2.0,I bought this watch and have had it a little over a month. It broke already and I didn’t even bump it on anything
2.0,"This was a bit large for my 7 year old son. It doesn't stay up well. Also, the stitching is starting to come out on one end after just a couple of uses."
2.0,I had the impression these were purple. Mine are navy blue and hot pink so I am not loving the color.
2.0,These are hard to adjust and really big not suitable for super small fingers
2.0,Unfortunately ( as described) these sunglasses  are NOT POLARIZED! :(
2.0,"They fit and feel really well.. Esp on my 9 year old who is very skinny. These wash well and haven't pilled yet either. I really didn't want tight pj's and these were a very loose comfortable fit.<br /><br />Update: After three months of regular use, these pj's pill horrendously. It's very noticeable and looks really bad. For the price I paid, these aren't worth it. Walmart has cheaper and better quality pj's but they just aren't in stock all year."
2.0,I wanted to like this product but it feels so awkward on the face. It also gets really hot and humid inside.
2.0,Están muy bonita demasiado pequeñas
2.0,"It only took a few months for the holes to start getting stretched out and too wide. The belt itself is nice in looks, bit it didn't last long. Disappointed."
2.0,Too large and too thin.  The neckline was so huge that I looked like I had on one of those old timey men's bathing suits that was a tank top but the neck scooped way down.  No thanks.
2.0,The quality of the product is not good at all
2.0,Ordered 4 shirts the same size. 2 were a lot smaller
2.0,"Beautiful but shrinks in the wash. Order up a size or two. Such a disappointment, it is now really tight in the chest and waist and doesnt have the long flowy feeling that I wanted. I'm thinking I will return it."
2.0,"I have had Nevados boot and worn them for the last 12 years so I thought it time for a new pair. When they arrived I put on the left boot first and it was a good comfortable fit. I then put on the right boot, although it was marked as the same size it felt like it was 3 sizes too small1<br />I had to return them as they just did not fit."
2.0,I put a 2 star review because the hat is very cute but very small. I have a normal sized head and this won't fit....it wouldn't even fit my tweens head. I'd keep looking if I were you
2.0,"I ordered this charm to be added to my charm memories bracelet, but much to my dismay this can not be added unless a hook is added by the jeweler. I'm going to take it to the jeweler and see if I can a circular piece added for hanging. This charm is for link bracelet. I hope this review will help."
2.0,Pretty top but tight in bust ...Even ordered a larger size as I am big busted but still too tight
2.0,"There are seams down the center of the front and back of the dress that are very crooked. The V-neck isn’t even either, longer on one side. Would not reccomend to a friend."
2.0,The fit was tight. I ordered a size up and it was still too small. Doesn't look like the picture. Chains looked cheap and broke easily. Smh for the price I should have got a quality pair of jeans
2.0,It fit ok the color is as advertised.my only issue is I wear a 42DD and there is no support whatsoever.  In the photo it looks like there is some support or wire or something but it is not. So if u are a bustier women like myself take that into consideration.
2.0,"I’m 5’1, 127lbs, ordered extra small. I appreciate the pattern, color, and softness  on the outside. However, it’s not soft on the inside. Being that I am a short in stature person I figured I would not have any issues with the sleeves like in other reviews however, I not only were  the sleeves short on a short person but also  when buttoned, the sleeves were very tight on my wrist..The cut is still very big/oversized in an XS and the cut of the sleeve & shoulder areas are off likely  due to the compensation of trying to be oversized, I am returning."
2.0,"Received item without the &#34;secure adapter&#34;. Fantastic packaging and great looking band, but unusable without the adapter."
2.0,"This seemed like a cute wrap, but I would not feel comfortable wearing it as a skirt. It is a flimsy shiny material. It would be cute over a swimsuit, but I bought it with the hopes of wearing it to a HOT outdoor wedding over the summer and I ended up wearing something else. It just didn't seem appropriate."
2.0,not even remotely as pictured. Too bad. I passed along to a friend.
2.0,This shirt is long and is a strange material. I did not like it
2.0,"This necklace looks nice but has very little magnetism.  I need more magnetism because I have  vertigo and more powerful magnets have helped a lot, but vertigo has been bad with this necklace."
2.0,A lot larger than expected.
2.0,Returned. Not long enough
2.0,"They look nice,  but are too big for smaller wrists. I bought these for my 12 year old for her new watch and they just fall off her.  I would imagine that smaller women would have the same problem.  (She wears women's size small in clothes). I thought they would be tighter and stretch to fit,  but they are just very loose."
2.0,"First and foremost, they were small scratches on the lens.  It could have happened at the manufactures.<br />The picture makes them look as though the lens color is much darker than they are.  The colors on the lens is so light it's almost transparent.  They are very sturdy glasses for the price."
2.0,poor quailty
2.0,"Wow.  Most poorly fitting swimsuit I have tried on in a long time.  Would only recommend if you have zero hips and size A cup.  Otherwise, regardless of size ordered, this is likely to be too small and not flattering.  Can’t return it fast enough."
2.0,These have a base metal look to them - the metal work outshines the bling and gives the appearance of wearing hubcaps instead of the delicate feathery look I was hoping for.
2.0,Very thin without much compression.  They run large.  I got a XL. I’m 5’3” and weigh 195#. Should’ve gone with a large.
2.0,"Very cheap quality! Returned. For this price I expected thicker, better quality socks."
2.0,"Covered in tiny nits, like they had been washed with old towels, when they first arrived. That didn’t wash out. Only got worse. Will not buy again."
2.0,ridiculously tiny
2.0,I was not happy with the product said it had red lenses which is one of the color is recommended for playing golf come to find out the red is on the outside and vision wise it is gray!
2.0,Quality is good.  But top was small and bottoms were huge for the size I ordered.  Had to return.  They have to get the sizing figured out.
2.0,It was an alright shirt and soft but the material kind of feels cheap.
2.0,Weird material and too small when this is my size.
2.0,"Broke super easily, totally bummed"
2.0,"The frames are cheap, the lenses are plastic and doesn't stay clean long. But from a distance they look nice."
2.0,Tried bending it to fit it on and off my toe once and one of them broke.. not the best product
2.0,"Quality off leather is amazing,but on buckle color came off easily after few days using"
2.0,Is not the same as a picture shows I ordered one with a different design and is don’t same
2.0,knots came undone
2.0,"The feel of the leather was nice. The pack itself is quite &#34;puffy,&#34; extending out from the belt by around 3-4 inches. A single pair of standard black plastic frames took up all of one pouch and half of the other. However, I was outraged to discover that one of the leather zipper pulls installed was red, while the rest of the unit is black. I was going to use this in a professional setting, and a brilliant red leather zipper pull is completely off-putting. As it comes in red, it seems someone was just lazy and installed the wrong color. I am quite disappointed and returned the item."
2.0,Vest after 2 washes is starting to fall apart
2.0,"Buy one size bigger than you would normally wear. Dress is also very short, must wear leggings with it. Material does NOT breathe well so expect to sweat. I bought the white one, it did the job I bought it for but I will probably never wear it again."
2.0,Ran small and looks cheaper and more yellow in person. Loose strings all over
2.0,This item broke shortly after purchasing.
2.0,"I purchased this phone cover because description states it is slim, lightweight, and waterproof.  The cover is slim and lightweight however I'm not so sure about it being waterproof.  The cover over the charging plug is fragile.  I have had the cover for 4 days and the piece that plugs in the the earphone port and charging port has broken off while taking the phone in and out of my pocket.  I guess it got caught and was pulled off."
2.0,"I bought this item twice. The necklace is fine and I have of them both. The bracelet, both of them, broke the same way within days."
2.0,Love the material! But it doesn’t fit like in the picture and the pattern isn’t the same as the pic so kinda disappointed since i bought this for family pictures.
2.0,Definitely not surgical steel. They are great looking earrings but the metal is very very important as I can’t even wear 14k gold without getting an infection. Surgical steel is all I can wear. Ears are in a lot of pain - I tried sticking it out thinking they were just sensitive because of the threading but it was only getting worse.
2.0,Loved this one alot
2.0,Not flattering. Small top & very loose at bottom. Very thin fabric.
2.0,"I didn't have high expectations for this dress being that it cost $6. This was far worse than I thought. The material was like a kids costume and far too thick to wear in the summer. I am not saying not to purchase it. However, Just know what you are getting."
2.0,I bought the labradorite bracelet and only 6 out of the 16 stones even had a flash of color. I was happy with the size and how fast it was delivered. I wanted it to last a long time but it broke after I tried to take It off.
2.0,Cute but it turned orange a few days after putting it in
2.0,"This purse got 2 stars based on design and color, it's loose and roomy and functional while looking natural and rugged..  however...<br /><br />It smells like a loose woman who hasn't showered in 2 months.  Faux leather is always a gamble, but based on reviews I decided it was too good to pass up as it met my aesthetic desires and needs.<br /><br />But my gosh, this rotten fish smell.  I need to chat it in leather oil simply so it can rid the smell.. after airing it out for two weeks.. it still wafts smells of funk.  You can imagine my apprehension in ever taking it in public, without having to give it a disclaimer that it's not me!"
2.0,Wouldn't purchase again. XL was so narrow in width and elastic top cut into the back of my knee. Super UNCOMFORTABLE. Had to cut elastic. Get stocking that have you measure your legs and have sizing charts for a better fit. If you purchase these you better have skinny legs!
2.0,The silver really stands out a lot more than it looks like in  the picture... I didn't realize how many Rhinestones where in it... The product description should emphasize on just buying this leather band for women never guys. I think Im going to send it back. Really bummed is not what I thought.<br />  The company has been great though.. Quick shipping!
2.0,"The measurements aren’t accurate. I was afraid they’d be a bit tight, but they are quite big and the flowers feel rubbery. Don’t think they’ll last very long."
2.0,"Not at all the look and fit as the photo shows-the material is very thin and see through, the fit is weird and the print is blurry.  I returned them."
2.0,"These are the type of slippers I always wear but these are not sized correctly for the US market to me. In the first photo I have my current slipper (blue inside) next to the Husmeu slipper and it seems they are the same length (actually in the photo the Husmeu looks a bit longer) but because the they are so narrow, plus the fur taking up room, it is uncomfortable for my foot to slide all the way up. I was thought maybe they stretch a bit to my foot in time however the fur inside don't seem to stretch so I doubt this will ever happen. I normally take size women's 9. I ordered size 9-10 but should have ordered 10-11. I think that would have been a much better fit so size up.<br />The slippers are fur lined completely, even the inside top of them which would be great for those cold mornings or during winter but I do not recommend them for hot climates or summertime. The inside bottom of them are soft but I have memory foam footwear and the slippers don't feel like ""memory foam"" to me. I know not all memory foam is the same and it can be due to just being a different or the thickness, I am just saying that it just don't feel like memory foam to me.<br />The bottom of the slipper is sewn on by one row of stitches. I know it isn't attached above the stitch line and can't tell if it is attached in any other way at or below the stitch line. In my past experiences, any footwear that is only secured by one row of stitches fall apart rather quickly because a stitch breaks.<br />The bottom is another issue I didn't care for. The description says they are rubber and no slip. Notice in the photo what the bottom looks like. It is flat with raised diamonds and that flat area around the diamonds feels smooth so you are relying on the raised diamonds and that little strip of textured rubber that is around the bottom to keep you from slipping. Remember, these were advertised that you can wear outdoors too. I wouldn't trust that bottom non-slip part after awhile since I think it would wear down rather quickly. (I can't prove it but it is just a gut feeling.)<br />While I can't recommend these for everyday use, I am putting these in my overnight bag (can't begin to tell you how many times I packed that thing forgetting my slippers) as they should be fine for occasional wear."
2.0,This was way too small and I am in the process of returning it
2.0,"Had to return this, too small, not US sizing.  Wasn't a fan of the material with these colors either."
2.0,"The stone was attached a tiny bit crooked. For the price, I expected better quality. It was not enough to deal with the hassle of sending it back, but detracts from the over all beauty of the piece."
2.0,"The shirt is pretty but the material is that stretch, sweat-wicking, not a standard cotton T. Plus, they used an iron-on for the decal which is not good on such stretchy material. The iron will crack under pressure. I'm returning it. Hopefully, I can find one that made of real T-Shirt material."
2.0,I work at UPS so depending what u want these for they only last a week
2.0,The fit of this product was as expected except that the bottom was tighter than shown and the pockets back so far that it feels weird to put your hands into. I was very disappointed in the quality of the shirt. The top as you can see in the photos looks washed out already and a lot more pink for the leopard one than was shown as well. I ordered the leopard not the pink one. The fading was what got it the two stars though. I don’t like to wear stuff that looks washed out before I even wear it.<br />The two stars was for the shirt fitting well up top and the fast shipping.
2.0,had to punch hole in it to fit
2.0,Wasnt aware that the back of the shirt was different than the front.
2.0,I am a size 4-6 and I got this in a small. I LOVE the skirt but it runs BIG! The small was ENORMOUS! I am SO DISAPPOINTED they do not have extra small. Size down if you get this.
2.0,"beautiful shoes. but a very sharp and not pleasant smell of chemistry held for several days, very persistent. after washing in the machine, the smell was slightly extinguished. the clasp is very dense, which is not bad, but the child does not cope with it for 5 years. although this may not be a problem for other children."
2.0,"It's extremely rare for me to write a bad review. I am sorry but I have to warn other folks...there have been other reviews that this product does not snap in. I have experienced this same problem. I put my lip ring in, went to eat dinner and it fell out while I was eating. You'd think with previous reviews of this problem the company would have done something to fix this problem. My current lip ring I've had for over a year and the stud has never fallen out while eating. I don't know where the stone went. This product is just not worth it. Had this on for like ten minutes.<br /><br />I'd give it one star but they are very pretty and the plastic is very comfortable. If they would just make sure the stud actually snaps in this would be a great product."
2.0,There were little fuzz balls on the sweatshirt. It’s a Christmas present for my daughter who is a huge Taylor Swift fan so she might not notice but this mother sure did!
2.0,"Sunglasses looks good but are heavier than expected, that is not good if you plan to wear it all day, but the part that I did not like was that it was already scratched when i received It, small scratches in both lens, but starched anyway, not happy."
2.0,"Kind of disappointed with these hoops. Pretty flimsy--not as thick as I expected from the photos. There are better earrings out there.  I love the pearl dangles, but I'm using them on other hoops and would give these hoops a 1 star if it wasn't for them."
2.0,First sunglasses only 3 months.  Bought my second set in Dec just broke in May. For $20.00 not bad but will not buy again.  Both sunglasses broke in the same spot at the hinges.  Plastic seems to be weak/brittle.  Maybe the screws in the hinges are too tight.
2.0,cheaply made not sturdy Ok for kids or as a base to cover
2.0,"You are lucky to get them on in one piece, toilet paper is thicker and more pliable!"
2.0,"I will be returning the necklace.  The chain looks expensive, however, the diamond heart is too large for the necklace..."
2.0,"super cute, but my daughter;s hair gets tangled in the letters on the back and the sprinkles on the goggles....kind of makes it not worth the cuteness"
2.0,"The Size Chart is a bit off, but they're super comfy."
2.0,"It's a love/hate relationship. The shorts themselves are lovely and exactly what I was looking for: lightweight, cool, breathable and very comfortable. I live in a warm tropical climate and these are perfect. However the craftsmanship is extremely poor. The threads were already unraveling when I received them and the front seam is coming apart, it's already opened 1&#34;. I'll sew them up so I can wear the shorts as long as possible, but it's probably not going to be a long-term relationship. If I could give separate ratings, it would be 5-stars for the material and design but 1 star for the craftsmanship. Buyer beware."
2.0,I ordered my size it was too tight so I reordered it in a larger size still too tight.  I gave the outfits away.
2.0,These run really big and I have a small rest and keep sliding off also the covers do not stay on so I would give It only 2 stars
2.0,"I like the lenses of this sunglasses.  good polarized and it seems to be good material, however, it is very heavy and press down on my nose.  I am an Asian and it is rather big, so it fits me well.  but just bit heavy."
2.0,I was excited to receive this necklace for my birthday and the day I decided to wear it the clasps on the Virgo was not tigen and I lost it.
2.0,"Beautiful earings, but they kind of stick out a little differently than expected, and the end of the stirrup on one of them was so sharp I started looking for a cup but tool to sand it down a little as it hurt behind my ear.<br /><br />Because of the design, these were difficult to put in, because the navigation of getting the stirrup into your ear was blocked of course by the wooden earring. No fault of the earring really. I just found them difficult to put in.<br /><br />After a week, one of them broke falling into the floor (about 3 feet onto a wood floor) from a table. So they are very fragile.<br /><br />The major flaws are the poorly made stirrup that goes into your ear (just to sharp and rough at the end) and the fact that they are soo soo fragile. Still pretty if you can keep them from breaking."
2.0,"I am sad,  because I ordered this beautiful dress to go with the blue wig and blue, green purse.<br />Unfortunately they all had to be returned,  the dress fit down to my hip.<br />I read all the reviews and ordered mine 2 size up."
2.0,"This coat shell is made of 60% wool, 10% cashmere and 40% synthetic. However it is described as 11% cashmere, 66% wool, 9% silk, 14% polyester. What makes the seller to lie?!"
2.0,"It does a pretty good job maintaining heavy use shoes and work boots, but it quickly falls apart melting it's internal connections and shorting out with added bonus of some potential fire hazard."
2.0,I did not like the padded bar
2.0,Normally wear a 2x or 18/20. Couldn't even try it on. Looks about like a medium.  Really sad because the pattern is cute.
2.0,Around the chest fit good but cup size was way too big.
2.0,"The heart edges are almost sharp, like it is unfinished.  Not smooth like picture.  The chain & clasp are nice."
2.0,"not a good fit, very wide"
2.0,"Bought this specifically for the neck detail pictured, but no matter how I stretch it, it never comes close to looking like what is shown on the model.  In the attached photo, the top image is actually better than it usually looks (often large, loose loops hanging all over the place); the second image is with my shoulders pulled back, unnaturally; the third image is with my hand pulling the shirt down as far as I'm able without damaging it.  Think I'll just cut the detail off (it's sewn into the back of the v-neck) and leave it as a basic, comfy shirt to knock around in.  I will say that the fabric is very soft, but the detail has been nothing but a disappointment.  It's a shame I bought two of them (a charcoal one, as well) ... will have to do the same alterations with that one, now, too."
2.0,In picture looks sequin . It’s not very disappointed
2.0,dress just ok...not what I expected...hate the neck...looks like a stretched out tee shirt
2.0,"They are much bigger than I wanted. For $5 I won't bother to return them, but they are too large for a small stature woman IMO. Maybe fine for a man."
2.0,"The ring is fine for my uses I suppose. I was disappointed that the ring was very different from the product image. Mine was highly polished so I used a fine scotch brite pad to dull it down a bit. The shank, finger hole, of this is unreasonably sharp. All in all, for the price, It's.... Meh... ok. I wouldn't recommend it to someone else though."
2.0,"I usually wear Large size, and I got this one woth XL size because the bras would run too small, according to the reviews. But... it’s too big for me and the white elastic bands on the back looks too lose just like a torn or used one."
2.0,"Stiff. Color not pretty. Stitching coarse looking. I'd return it, but such a hassle."
2.0,"Nice fabric and fit, very poor workmanship. After 1st wearing, the hem of one leg completely unraveled."
2.0,"I typically wear L to XL. Could not even get these over my leg. My daughter who wears a small fits in them, but they’re so sheer, she won’t wear them. Disappointed because this brand is usually really good."
2.0,"I am disappointed because the description said I would get Navy, Grey, &White and 3 assorted colors. I did not get navy or grey and that was what I wanted the most. Instead I got 2 red, 2 blue and 2 white. I thought it was going to be an assortment of colors."
2.0,Its super thin the outside pocket is where your credit cards go.
2.0,Not good fabric.  Rips when removed
2.0,I returned this item but do not know if I received a credit for it?
2.0,cute but too big for my 10-month baby even I pick 0-6months.
2.0,Lights Don't last long. Have to charge often. My  Kids only wore them briefly.<br />A little on the big size.
2.0,"I dont know how they stretched, manipulated this product to look like these pictures. But I bought 2 and they both just look like scrub tops."
2.0,I almost feel like these pants were made as a joke. They are baggy like hammer pants and flare at the bottom. They have this strange elastic at the waist that looks like an '80's hair scrunchie. They are NOTHING like the pictures. I may actually wear them for Halloween. They are SO AWFUL. But I expect nothing less for the price tag. I think I paid $6 for them. Do not expect them to be cute like in the pics.
2.0,Did not have sash attached which is fine because you can just tie it. Mines was missing the broach on the sash. Very disappointed thats what made the dress stand out.
2.0,"Loved it but a couple of high fives and the pins broke holing the strap to the watch, just cheaply made."
2.0,The watch is way too small should be made for a child not a man
2.0,The dress length for super tall and waist length for super short person.  Nice dress otherwise
2.0,Very thin material.  Not much stretch to it.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"I used this mask maybe 3 times. After that the filter started falling off. seems like quality at first, but it is cheaply made."
2.0,It diesnt have good elastic material. If your not careful when you put it on you will stretch it out of shape
2.0,Is so large!! Like a chef hat
2.0,I received earrings but they are not what I ordered. I bought them for a special occasion and am not going to go through the hassle of returning them. I just wish they would have came as advertised. Funny thing is that the earrings I received are not even listed. The gold looks like it will rub off eventually. Beware that you may not get the exact style that you ordered.
2.0,The gloves are warm and are pretty; however my right glove immediately had a tear in the seam - like it wasn't stitched completely.  Too much hassle to return for the price I paid though.
2.0,"Have worn three times and the black threading has already come loose. Too late to return now, unfortunately."
2.0,looked weird
2.0,Is nice but it has been used it came dirty and not sure how long it was used for. Not to happy.
2.0,I cannot open them but they are pretty
2.0,"Beautiful pieces, however they broke after the 3rd wear. Great for a days wear, if you want an inexpensive day look."
2.0,Ok but the nose pad broke off after a few uses
2.0,They are super cute but when you order a large they come in a small. And they are super thin.
2.0,This was a terribly fit shirt. I returned it immediately.
2.0,not as big as picture
2.0,"Product is a hat, its ok, but it came two months after anticipated ship arrival"
2.0,Straps way too slippery and when adjusted and I ran in this completely loosened up
2.0,nice material<br />disappointed it doesn't fit my grandson
2.0,Doesn’t fit. I ordered the size 34 and I wear a 34 waist. It doesn’t fit but looks nice. I will be giving it to a friend
2.0,"The watch seems to work just fine, I wasn't expecting it to be so heavy. I personally do not like it, Its in a drawer somewhere, Very heavy. It's so heavy unless you have the band so tight you lose feeling in your fingers it will slide around to the back side of your wrist. Also the huge center knob will hit the back of your hand every time you flex your wrist to far. Overall, just not a good watch for me."
2.0,It's not a long cardigan. Very short.
2.0,"This a a beautiful dress -- it fits me well, tru to size, and looks great.  Unfortunately I noticed an area near the back of the right arm where 2 lines of beads were missing totaling about 7 inches.  At the time, the dress was no longer available on Amazon so I decided to have it repaired by a local seamstress (a little bag of beads and sequins were luckily still attached to the dress).  Of course, now that I've already taken it to the seamstress I see the dress is once again available on Amazon in my size."
2.0,"They are soft, do not roll but are too high waisted for short people with zero butt."
2.0,The decal started to come apart when wearing it the 1st day
2.0,"It supposed to be one size fits all,but is to small"
2.0,"this thing feels sturdy & you will need a stiff belt that's at least 2.5 inches wide & substantially thick  so that the weight of the camera doesn't threaten to pull your pants down. the picture shows this being clipped onto the waist band of the guy's jeans, which means that the hard 4.5"" x 5 "" slightly contoured plastic ""clip"" part will be against your skin/underwear.  Will comment later on how comfortable that is. the impressive metal part of this is screwed onto the plastic clip. The item does not come with instructions,so you are left to decide for yourself just how to attach this to you. You can thread a belt through the clip & have the whole thing hand outside of your pants/clothing. But if you choose to use it as a clip the way it is pictured (guy in jean pic), then I sincerely doubt the longevity of the product as you will be ""stretching"" ?/bending the one part away from the other in order to attach it.While most of the item's plastic is substantial, the area that will be stressed by multiple uses & eventually break. It's a bad design for a $30 item. Also in order to release the camera, you must press 2 areas (next to each other) at the same time,  which is awkward & does not result in a smooth quick release. This may require less dexterous & less strong fingered people to use 2 hands; not optimal considering you need one had to hold the camera you are removing. Am considering returning this."
2.0,"I wanted to love this set because it’s a beautiful color and pattern, but I am returning it.  The shorts run small and fit weirdly and as another reviewer mentioned, the buttons popped open as I was putting the top on and taking it off.  I doubt they would stay buttoned while sleeping.  I ordered a medium.  Do not waste your money on this set."
2.0,"These are VERY small so if you have a larger head, stay away! I returned mine because they looked so bad."
2.0,The pants 👖 fit fine but the top sleeves are to short for my arms.
2.0,"I don't Care for this on me, you can see the lining through some clothes.<br />material is good.<br />As with all clothing items, my taste is not what yours may be, so you should try whatever you think you like and see for yourself."
2.0,Sized up for my daughter but still obscenely tight for a junior. Its very pretty but will be returning.
2.0,"Although a great design,, when it arrived the center piece was only attached on one side.  I can easily fix it but just seems like no quality control exists.  I would seriously consider packing differently as well."
2.0,The glasses tend to slide out very easily. When I tried to adjust the metal piece the whole loop broke off. The only way I could get them to work was to weave back-and-forth through the rubber pieces and slot at the end of the elastic band. They made it bulky and was still too easy to takeoff.
2.0,Unfortunately these masks to not contain nose clips to make the fit a bit snug.
2.0,I bought four sweaters from this seller and everyone of them are good quality and very nice. I gave two stars due to the fact that this particular sweater is torn around the neck line.
2.0,"It turned out to be NOT tarnish free and it broke within about two weeks. The break was my fault, but the tarnish was certainly not my fault.  Will not be buying this one again."
2.0,"When I first took it out of the package, I thought it was the wrong item. The quality of the material is tragic - doesn’t look or feel anything like a swimsuit. I may return because it looks so awful, or keep because my baby is likely to grow out of it in a matter of weeks, and this will at least suffice for winter break and a few weeks of swim classes, but... honestly, yuck. Thriftiness isn’t always successful."
2.0,Not strong enough to hold me tees. Material kept slipping out.
2.0,"Cute dress, but very cheap. You get what you pay for. I recommend hand washing and not machine if you want it to last."
2.0,"My daughter liked it. However, I felt that it looked like thin cheap pleather."
2.0,I ordered according to measurements provided and could not zip them up.
2.0,"Not sure what's going on with cloth belts on Amazon, but there's zero consistency w/ sizing, compared to other belts.. This belt is marked &#34;38, fits size 36&#34;. I have a 34&#34; waist (and I know this because I can read a tape measure). I ordered the 36/34 belt, which was 2&#34; too short, and tried this size thinking these belts are some kinda crazy 'Euro sizing'...Nope, this was loose on the tightest/first punch hole.  I've bought and sent back 4 belts on Amazon, and I'm officially over trying to buy any more cloth belts, except for Tommy Hilfiger, which are cut and sized perfectly and consistency. Just my .02, ymmv"
2.0,Poor quality material and the tie was impossible to tie properly. I washed the outfit before putting it on my son but unfortunately forgot to wash the hat and his head did turn red from it. I wouldn't suggest this outfit for professional pictures.
2.0,"I tried it on once, and I'm returning. the sleeves were a bit too small for me. I didn't realize that the sizes were probably different bc these are made in china. Returning"
2.0,"Too small, thumb too tight and the way the thumb is stitched to the glove it will tear easily.  Sending back."
2.0,Material is thin. Good for when you just need something to put on. True to size.
2.0,It's a XXL for a small child maybe!
2.0,La tela es pura licra no me gusto
2.0,"Cute  but very disappointed in design of buckle clasp, not sure how to buckle strap, bottom plastic part of shoe a bit rough and jagged, rubs my daughter's foot, not enough extra holes in strap for adjustments"
2.0,"I love the style and the idea of it but as one with a long torso, this was not for me. It will dig up in your crotch in order to get straps on. The cups are also way small. So if you have larger than a DD, forget it."
2.0,"These glasses are cute. But, they are very flimsy and not made very well. When I was cleaning the lenses with my shirt the lens popped right out. It was easy to put it back in. The frame is very maluable, and when you close them it tends to bend a bit. So I have to keep adjusting them. I see some people asking to put regular prescription lenses in and I do not recommend these glasses be your first choice. I took some pictures showing how easily you can bend them."
2.0,"Cut off the circulation of the fingers of my 9 year old daughter. Not sure who this would ever fit. It's an absolute joke that they show it on actual ""hands"". I guarantee the piece they used for the images is not what they are selling.<br /><br />It looks neat sitting on a desk collecting dust though."
2.0,I should have listened when someone else said that there was a stain on the dress. Mine too had a stain (it is going back). This dress runs small so make sure to get a bigger size. I did this and it fit fine. I do not like the pockets or the cut. It accentuates your hips and makes them look even bigger. The waist is also very high (right under your chest). The material is nice and the color is bright (but I liked that about it).
2.0,"I got this because I was tired of showing so much cleavage in yoga class.  It is a beautiful top and doesn't show top cleavage, but I had a wardrobe malfunction when a breast popped out of the side during a crowded class.  Very embarrassing, so I will not wear it in public again.  Why can't a big yoga company like Prana make tops for women over a C cup?"
2.0,My badge reel broke into 3 pieces 2 weeks after buying it. The cap is just glued on to the reel so it pops off super easy.  I had to glue back on twice. Then the whole reel itself broke
2.0,"I am 5'4"", weigh 145 lbs with an apple shape, and typically wear a size 14 or large. I ordered these in a large because the description said ""true to size, order usual size"". I wash and dry all clothes before reviewing and these pajamas shrunk considerably.  Obviously, you want PJs to be comfy and these were not, way too snug! I gave them to my much smaller sister (who probably wears a small or maybe medium in PJs) and she said they fit her but the buttons did gap a bit. It's a shame because they really are cute pajamas."
2.0,It was nice until I tried it on. The label and fit did not match
2.0,Even two sizes larger than normal was way too small.
2.0,"Nice fabric, long in the back but the knot in the front is to high up, shows stomach. Just not for me"
2.0,Cheaply made came with the hole already in the cargo pocket. Very cheap material does not hold up to the wash.
2.0,"The gemstones were really nice. Seemed to be good quality, however, The wire for the wrap was too thin and broke off right away. I did not return them though as I will re wrap them myself with better wire."
2.0,I love it but it was too baggy on me unfortunately.
2.0,"Shirt runs small through the body. Will have to return both. I usually wear XL, this one is more like a Large and is too tight."
2.0,The product did not match the photo.
2.0,Real flimsy frames and did not darken in the sunlight
2.0,"I thought the fit would be different, it’s better suited for a skinny figure otherwise it looks like a moo moo."
2.0,"This bag looks so much cuter in the photos than in person. I would give it one star but it did arrive very quickly, which is an additional star for the seller.<br /><br />In person, the color of the bag is a dull gray and the owls, while vibrant, are only printed onto the canvas, not dyed into it. They will fade quickly with use and if you throw it into the wash.<br /><br />I do not know what &#34;quality&#34; the other reviewers are talking about as this bag looks flimsy and cheap. The lining is this thin, hard, rayon-like material that looks like it's easy to snag. The zippers are cheap and will probably break with constant use.<br /><br />It also has this weird chemical smell. It was very strong when I opened the plastic bag it was shipped in but has faded after a day.<br /><br />I also found it a lot smaller than expected. I have an 11&#34; macbook air with a sleeve and it does not even fit horizontally. When I put it in vertically, there's barely any space left for a school book, much less a notebook.<br /><br />One good thing about it is that the strap looks solidly sewn on. That's about the only good thing. This is a bag I'm sure I can find being sold on a street corner in Asia for $3-5 max.<br /><br />I have started the process of returning it. I hope it's painless."
2.0,Horrible smell that permeated my house and leather was paper thin in a 2 square inch area.
2.0,"I knew these were not expensive jewelry, and I make inexpensive jewelry but these were lacking in many ways. They look cheap and one fell apart as I was putting in ear."
2.0,Watch appears to be 38mm instead of 40mm. The crystal is blue tinted rather than clear with blue dial. Very hard to read.
2.0,Not anywhere long enough.
2.0,"Band most definitely does not look retro or weathered, it's a shiny brown. There are no quick release pins so was a bit of a struggle to change band."
2.0,Bought bag for girlfriend. Looks great but didn't even last a month before one of the straps started to rip and eventually break. My girlfriend is great at sewing and was able to repair it. But if she couldn't of fixed it we would of returned it.
2.0,"I bought the size (medium) as described by the chart, and it's the equivalent of an XL. Extremely stretchy, so it won't last as an undershirt. Very weird sizing. No smalls."
2.0,Do not purchase if you have boobs! I have DD. Fabric does not cover boobs
2.0,Main reason for two stars is that many of the red stones were broken and loose in the package before I opened it.  Cannot use 1/2 of the package.
2.0,Hard to fasten (then tighten) around the neck.  Just hung there.  Two of us simply could not figure it out.
2.0,It's cute but it came looking dirty on the exterior. Inside is nice suede.  Shoulder strap broke in 2 weeks. Meh. Get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,I was super excited for these sunglasses because of the style but when I was in the sun i was blinded!!! They didn't work like normal sunglasses protecting my eyes from the sun there more of just for show glasses.
2.0,"Update: While the quality of this item was not to my liking, the seller reached out right away and was friendly, professional, and offered a full refund of my purchase. Great customer service, thank you.<br /><br />This top is not my usual style, but I thought it might be cute to wear for my son’s space themed birthday party. This is the worst quality garment I have ever purchased. It looks like it was sewn by a three year old and sold off the racks at the Dollar Tree."
2.0,But not as I expected..
2.0,"I ordered a Red Floral dress, received a hot pink. Also, the lengths listed above are definitely inaccurate. I ordered an XL for the sake of length, and beware - if you are 5'11&#34; and taller, this will be a couple of inches short of a maxi dress. Disappointed, returning it."
2.0,Had less than 2 weeks sole started to come loose and stitching began to unravel nice looking shoe but cheaply made. Definitely not made for active kids
2.0,I only received the top part. If I get sent the bottom part then I will give 5 stars. Definitely like the top...not much support wise but totally cute and different!
2.0,I am a huge Keen fan but these fit horribly. They ran large and are not adjustable enough. The front strap is too deep and not adjustable. The back strap is not adjustable enough either for narrow feet.
2.0,Love them but too small<br />No true size :(
2.0,"I got these because we have hard wood floor and my 15 month old kept falling in her footy pajamas. When the first are put on they are great, but because they come off so easily I can not give them a good rating. We’ve had a lot of injuries because she’s tried to play in them and has fallen on the floor."
2.0,My ears are not sensitive but these earrings really hurt my ears. I couldn’t make it through the work day.
2.0,"I bought these for gym training - weight class and dance class (body jam, Zumba) - and really wanted to like them, since I loved the color and the light weight feel. But when I worked out high impact, my toes tingled, went numb and cramped because the toe bed is very narrow. Also, there wasn't enough cushion for me. When doing lunges, the ball of my feet hurt. Can't return them because I wore them several times. These might be fine for someone with a narrow foot."
2.0,"I bought versions of this shoe for my daughter three years ago and was very satisfied. However, this was my 1yo son’s first pair of shoes, and after only two months of gentle use, this happened! For almost $40, I would expect more wear out of them. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. Not as expected. Not as glam, in person."
2.0,Ordered the 20 hoping there would be room as u have some curves. I'm a 16 and these didn't fit. No stretch either. Retuning.
2.0,"I thought it was cute, but there was a hole in it :/"
2.0,These are absolutely not squat poof. They are cute but don’t lift in them. Very disappointed
2.0,How do people like these? Mine squeak so badly I can’t even wear them for fear of the entire gym staring at me!
2.0,This  was definatly not my favorite purchase . Quality was poor . Top fit funny and bottoms were VERY large .
2.0,In the picture it has a embroidered seal on the side (which is the reason I bought this one). When it came it had no Seal.
2.0,Strap broke the first time using it.
2.0,The medium is a big medium. Thus it was returned.
2.0,"Shoes fit perfectly, felt light weight and super breathable. Downside was they were not slip resistant as advertised. If you work with cars I DO NOT RECOMMEND. If you like the style and don't need them to be non slip these shoes would be great for you!"
2.0,I’m only 5’2 and I bought these to wear postpartum. I knew I would need a large in the top and that would likely be the size that fit the bottom too. I have short legs and a short torso and these pants were so long and so high waisted that I could pull them over my chest and wear them as a onesie (of course I didn’t actually wear them that way.) I wish the pants would have fit better because it really is a comfy set.
2.0,It fit perfect when I got it. I washed it and hung it up to dry and it shrunk. It was to short after I washed it
2.0,"One of my socks is missing the extra stitching. If it was just a pattern sewn in then it wouldn't be a problem, but with these socks, the grey part is thicker and provides more cushion. So the ball of my foot has less padding then the other and it feels weird."
2.0,The clip doesn't extend far enough out from the hinge. They might work for wire rims?<br />The lenses stick out at an angle for my glasses and won't be useable.
2.0,"Bought 4 of these for gifts. The hearts were not attached, one heart was missing the ring to attach it to jetting, and one was scratched."
2.0,Item runs smaller than expected
2.0,Writing is very faint.  Difficult to read.
2.0,"I got this necklace as my first Mother's Day gift from my infant son via my husband. It is absolutely adorable. I LOVED it. I wore it to work, as a hostess, and by the end of my four hour shift my neck was already green and the necklace itself as well. I understand that this is costume  jewelry, but I've had 25 cent gumball machine necklaces take longer to discolor. I gave it two stars only because for exactly 4 hours I adored this necklace,  got a TON of compliments and LOVED it. I'm sad I won't wear it again. I just threw it away."
2.0,The red case has a rip  and the black one a dent in it!  Very dissatisfied!!!!
2.0,I loved this bathing suit in the picture. I did not when I got it. It definitely run REALLY SMALL.  Also seems to me its very cheaply made. Would not purchase again.
2.0,La tela un poco transparente
2.0,Quality of stitching is poor
2.0,I got these at a great price and my husband needed new underwear. What was suppose to be 2 day shipping ended up into 5 days but they arrived finally. My husband rides his bike every evening and tried these out for the ride. He was excited when they arrived because the say no ride up. He went on his bike ride and came back saying no ride up my ass (lol) and pulled down his pants to show me that the boxer briefs were all the way up his butt almost. I did laugh but it was a funny look at the moment. And he says they are tight but this was his recommended size and the size he normally wears. They are pretty in colors and he says it feels like he's wearing nothing which he likes so I gave 2 stars for that but they do ride up bad.
2.0,It is see through. Even before I put it on you can tell it is see through.  Very thin material.  Definitely not bodycon type wear.
2.0,"I bought these for my wedding, but they came with stones missing and I'll have to figure out how to fix that. Super unhappy about the missing stones, otherwise they're pretty"
2.0,"The materials and stitching are great. The gusset in the crotch makes a great difference. The sewing in the knees is great. All good things but I cannot give more than three stars because the sizing is so wildly off it’s laughable. I have three pairs and all of them are supposed to be 33x34 (although I actually wear a 32x34) and every single one is completely different, in length and in waist. One pair I have to wear a belt, another pair I had to remove the stud and sew a button about 1/4” over for it to be a true 33 and a different pair sits above the waist but is designed to sit at or below. I absolutely will never place them in the dryer either as they will then be completely too small. There is next to no sizing QC it seems. It’s disappointing as I like the styles but probably will not purchase anymore pairs."
2.0,"Purchased conductive bands two weeks ago upon reading the reviews. Followed the instructions. The adhesive was very sticky but not sticky enough to hold on the bottom of the shoes. During my workouts, people were pointing out that I had a flap coming out from under my shoes. I ended up placing gorilla glue on the bottom of my shoes.  While wearing my shoes into the grocery store I received numerous shocks coming through the cart as I was pushing it.  To date, I can only say that I am still trying to figure this out. I recommend another alternative."
2.0,It came eariler and I was so excited to try. It looks nice and really pretty in the package but when I unpacked it I realized it was poor made. The code on the bottom connector is chipped and has no coating there. With the price I know I shouldn't complain much but I expect something good. Now I'm not sure if I can wear this ring safely.
2.0,"I actually wore this once before I realized that it was messed up! Thankfully, I worse a cardigan over it, so I one else was able to notice that part of the chest/sleeve was sewn into the seam. I grabbed it to wear the second time and instantly noticed the flaw. I bought several other colors in this dress that aren’t flawed."
2.0,"This shirt is ugly. I'm not even being picky-its just not a pretty (or professional) shirt. I really, really wanted to like it too, because the inside liner is incredibly soft. Not dryer safe either. Back to the drawing board. : /"
2.0,Too small to get into my ears...just didn't work for me. They are very pretty though.
2.0,Too short on the legs
2.0,This bathing suit is super cute. The top fit great.<br />The bottoms not so much. They are not high waisted at all they fit more like bikini bottoms.
2.0,shoddy work
2.0,Their size 4 slipper compared to a size 3 of a different brand. Their size 4 slipper is actually like a size 2 in standard sizes. They size differently and I didn’t realize it.
2.0,Bands aren’t bad however while removing the blue and red line bands they WILL come apart. You can find better bands out there for sure
2.0,"I typically am between a small and a medium; I'm 5'0&#34; and 126lbs. I guessed medium on this one since there weren't any reviews yet. Dead wrong. It's more like a tunic than a tank top. And the cute bow just kind of hangs on the back, the shirt isn't gathered in the back like the picture. Pretty bummed about this one."
2.0,I love this bag I pulled out found this .. wish it could have been better made with sturdy items. Thanks if you like to send me an replacement 😉 That would be nice I love this bag..
2.0,"The Pearl and setting are very small.  the CostCo product is much better, slightly more.<br />this looks really cheap!"
2.0,The way it advertised it was smaller than what they said it was.
2.0,Really small sizes
2.0,"The fabric is very soft and the color is great -- but it arrived incredibly wrinkled.  After looking at the fabric up close, it looks like it would be very high effort to maintain.  Mostly rayon, very thin and it would be perpetually wrinkled no matter what you did.  Life is too short to spend time trying to iron something that will only look like you slept in it 5 minutes later.<br />Then I tried it on.  Cute style --- but the arms were crazy short - and not in a cute or 3/4 length way--- just in a strange way that has a ""cuff"" with a button on it.<br />Returned."
2.0,Very disappointed. It’s a t-shirt with lace on it. Not worth the money.
2.0,Didn't use could not open the jar. Useless
2.0,Looks better in the pic material is hard and there is no stretch to it fits on the smaller size I wouldn't bother wasting your money
2.0,"The cut and fit on this top was great and very cute. I have a large chest and have to be careful with shirts that have an underbust seam because it often doesn't go down far enough, but I didn't have that issue with this shirt.<br /><br />However, the fabric quality on this shirt is awful. The first time I wore a light cardigan over it the shirt pilled like crazy under the arms and around the front of the chest. The pilling gets worse every time you wear it, and within a few washes it's become thin and thread bare. I don't even bother wearing it anymore because it went from looking cute to looking trashy and worn out within a few washes. I know you can't expect much from cheap clothes off Amazon, but this just isn't worth the money."
2.0,A little on the tired side for big guys
2.0,I ordered these in the summer and it is like the middle of december now and they still have not come. Just wish they would have because they are super cute
2.0,"I'm 6'3"". These pants are way too short in length. Not just above ankle, but just below knee."
2.0,"As stated here before, this is not sized for an ankle, it just fits my wrist. So buy it for use as a bracelet, not an anklet. Also fairly cheap material. (Plastic)"
2.0,Great idea however they are too tight at the top (I ordered the largest size) and they just keep rolling down.
2.0,"Runs very small. I'm usually a medium, size 10/12 & I ordered an XL. The waist fit but was very snug and the elastic on the ankles is very tight.Would like to return if I can get free return shipping."
2.0,Is not 100% waterproof.
2.0,"The hat seems decent, but it arrived damaged.  The front (just above the jeep mark) was squished inward pretty badly, and won't straighten out.  So there's a crease that looks like crap."
2.0,Their other shirts have fantastic stretch.  This is not the same quality
2.0,I thought this product was going to be twice the size it was. I also thought it was going to be real metal. I clearly didn’t do my homework on it. But it is a very beautiful addition to my moon collection. I just wish I could wear it!
2.0,My least fave cami of those I own.  Not very soft.  Super think transparent material.  You’ll need to wear something with this unless you’re just sleeping in it.
2.0,"They’re cute, but that’s it. My daughter is chonky so they dug into her legs (leaving marks even after adjustment) and they STILL kept sliding down"
2.0,"The size says US10, but these are way too small. My foot hangs out almost 2 inches. I need to return them."
2.0,"Ordered navy xl, very soft, clingy, thin fabric shows every bump.  Color was true navy and seemed well constructed. Returned the dress."
2.0,First of all they distort the image .<br />Second they are not offering a good protection in case you are using a power tool that is producing also some air flow. The air together with the dust particles are going around the glasses and enters into my eyes
2.0,Although it was a nice bag for the money it looked a little cheap and it was too small for my purposes.
2.0,"You get what you pair for color bleed on everything, also runs way big"
2.0,For me they didn't fit right and the tops kept coming off
2.0,"I sent this as a Valentine's gift, but it didn't have a clasp. I am very upset."
2.0,"Too large. Have to tie the waistband tight to keep the size I normally wear up. The stitching feels off. The pockets are small. The ankles are so tight I almost fell getting them on. Overall, not a great buy. Get something else!"
2.0,"I really like this brand of chocolate.  But the entire package of caramel chocolates bunnies were smashed with caramel all over the inside wrapper.  How can a person enjoy this!!!  I looked on my order to have them replaced & it says, not returnable or replaceable.  Okie dokie.  No more ordering this item.  If it's not edible, it's a waste of money."
2.0,coat made well id say. looks nice.falls over hip area. however i wear medium. i bought large to have plenty of room however arms too short coat would fit a size 2woman
2.0,"Ordered by the size chart provided by the seller. Not even close. Check the size chart, then order two sizes up. The bunny ears are pretty raggedy, literally just tapes together, but I didn't need them. Size aside, everything else is average quality. The hair clip is glittery. Needs ironing!"
2.0,"The boots look great, the best looking of all the winter boots for toddlers you can find in Amazon. Unfortunately they run too small, maybe 2 sizes too small. My baby has wide feet and although he's size 4, we bought size 5 and they couldn't fit. I just returned them, a shame as they are great looking"
2.0,Super cheap fabric. It's soft but very clingy and does not flow like what the pictures show...  Def came right under my bust not a drop waist like many of the pics show.<br />Top is black and the bottom is navy blue.  Looked black in pictures.  See through and clingy.  This will be returned.  Was really hoping it would work out for attending a graduation.
2.0,To heavy zipper heavy on shoulders. Zipper way to big
2.0,"In terms of the panties, they are soft and fit perfectly. I love them.<br /><br />My complaint is the false advertising. The main description says it’s a 12 pack, but I received a 7 pack. I thought they shorted me, but the lower description shows it’s a 7 pack. Why are these panties all called a 12-pack then?! Very deceptive marketing."
2.0,"If you wear any size bigger than a 34b this isnt a bra for you. Even though it says runs small, thats a huge understatement. Honestly I had higher hopes for this but luckily I found something different that would work."
2.0,"Not what I expected, longer than pictured and sticks out quite a bit. On about half of them, the edges have extra material on them and are too rough to attempt to put through my piercing. The tip is still really noticible, not clear at all."
2.0,Was way to big and sheer to wear as a sundress.
2.0,"Really cute, but too small for my daughter. material does not stretch"
2.0,Catches and pulls on the fibers of my sleeves. Have to be careful to only wear with short sleeves.
2.0,"I was disappointed when it arrived, and I had been excited to receive it. The design is just darling, but the fabric is cheap. On its first wear my daughter didn't like wearing it because it irritated her skin, and she had to take it off at school and change shirts."
2.0,"I thought I was getting deck shoes that would conform better than these did. If you're looking for outdoor slippers, these will be ok. However, when dragging these on the carpet indoors, they quickly become more of a hazard. Your mileage may vary, but for me, the rubber soles caught the carpet in a way that I twisted my ankle and bruised my knee inside the house. I guess I wasn't meant for slippers. Good Luck."
2.0,Nice earrings but the stones kept falling off the post. I had to crazy glue them on.
2.0,"Too short, I wouldn’t recommend. I’m 5’ 11” and they fall about 2” above my ankles."
2.0,Didn't like the way it fit and it was way too small even though it was labeled my size
2.0,The bracelet does not look as in the picture. The stones are much smaller in reality and in combination with the setting look much darker (grayish than silver) than that seen in the picture. The flowers are tiny and not outstanding.<br />We have bought from Qianse before and loved the earlier product (Qianse Seven Tubes Pendant Necklace White Gold Plated Alloy Fashion Jewelry) but this one is just not he same quality. My wife is not sure whether to return it or live with it.
2.0,They ran small and I didn’t like the length in the crotch for my short torso
2.0,Very Cheap Quality looks like something you could put a quarter in a turn machine for and get out. If I’m being completely honest
2.0,Way too small... No way it would fit a 7-9 and missing stones... Very disappointing.
2.0,"I thought it would be roomier, the pattern doesn't match up in seams, right up front.<br />comfortable anyway"
2.0,"I’ve worn these 3 times and they are already broken.  If they hadn’t broke, I would’ve given them 5 stars!"
2.0,Rose color faded within a week to a bland silver color.
2.0,"I guess my first mistake was ordering this vs the XOXO version I actually cancelled that was like $10.00 because I really liked the bracelet on this watch. I will admit that I ordered this as a temporary ""substitute"" for my Michael Kors watch that I am sending in for repair/cleaning. With that being said I definitely did not have high expectations for a $20.00 watch. I did however, expect to get the watch I saw in the picture (review to my uploaded pictures for the review). I own two other Geneva watches that are solid decent little watches and I own about four XOXO watches that are also perfectly capable of being daily watches. So when I received this I was literally blown away. First of all its so giant I can legitimately wear it on my ANKLE! I wear my watches EXTREMELY loose.. If you look at the sales image you will notice the arrows inside the band pointing to the links which you can remove and you will also note the Geneva name. Well not the case with this watch! To top all of those issues its loud, like it sounds like coins inside a tin can. I am so unsatisfied.<br /><br />**** I need to add this UPDATED REVIEW **** I emailed the seller (Jill) and expressed my unhappiness. She IMMEDIATELY responded, apologized, and offered me a few options for solutions. I was so impressed that I actually felt guilty for being rude. I told her I would send her the watch back if she had anything similar in inventory that was of better quality and I would pay for it. She said no and told me she had already sent a rose gold watch that retailed for like 30.00 and to keep the other watch. Super impressed with Jill and Safari Watch Company which is why I upgrade this review by one star. She did tell me the watch was geneva watch regardless of all the flaws with the watch she is making it righ."
2.0,"Fabric seemed nice at first touch, but it had odd proportions. I ordered my normal plus size and it was comfortably loose in the torso, but the sleeves were tiny. The sleeves barely fit around my wrists, and so didn't come close to fitting around my biceps/triceps. It's like an adult plus size shirt with toddler sized sleeves sewn on. I'd say this is a really loose fitting item, but NOT for plus sizes unless you have T-Rex proportions."
2.0,"I loved these little rings, the only downfall is that they were a bit to small for my fingers. But they are well made and it took a few days before they turned my fingers green. Oh well. Time to dig out the clear polish."
2.0,The glue on the pearl of one earring fell off in bag and arrived that way
2.0,Weird sizing! First size way too small second  just one size up way too large.
2.0,"Frames were delivered on-time and were packed well. Happy with the appearance and they felt sturdy. Problem occurred when the frames were sent to the lab for the prescription lenses. The colored coating on the eye-pieces is not flexible and broke in several places when they were trying to install the prescription lenses. Fortunately for me, they replaced the frames. They wouldn't try installing the new lenses a second time so the Vision Center had to install the lenses. The manager said he installed them but was afraid the coating would crack at any time. I may have a problem finding someone willing to accept responsibility for any damage during installation. Cannot recommend."
2.0,A little to small but I guess stretched a lil with they had wide or halfs then the material is nice and smooth but mines came scratched you can see all the glue they used to put the bottoms won't buy again had no choice but to go with it because by the time for replacement it'd be too late for weeding
2.0,insulation too thick for gloves to be useful and touch screen abilities of gloves non existent.
2.0,"This is not flexible in any way, and it is not made for a small face. Seriously doesn't mold to any face, so I""m not sure if you can get any true protection."
2.0,Really enjoyed them for recreational use. Cheap plastic.
2.0,"Not worth it. First, the company shipped the wrong item and then about 20% did not work."
2.0,"The advertisement fooled. I saw the prefix ortho- the for symbol and I thought orthofeet had released a more cost effective shoe. So good work on them for duping me. I would send these back and actually get what I need, but unfortunately my other sites are trashed to the point if hurting my feet so I have to deal with it. If you have actual medical issues like plantar fasciitis, Morton's neuroma, etc. DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES. they won't help. I've worn them a half a day and my feet are killing me."
2.0,This slipper does not have the support I was looking for. If your feet don’t need support they are great but I was looking for a slipper with good arch support and this slipper isn’t it I am afraid. It was advertised as providing arch support but the support it offers is minimal
2.0,I was really excited 4 these earings as well but again they are starting to tarnish i am allergic 2 fake medal so I can't wear them anymore
2.0,The adjustable cord did not work! The wolf was smaller than portrayed in photo!  A gift for my husband and first time I got something from Amazon and was disappointed !
2.0,very small and shallow. fits more like a yarmulka than a hat. oh well
2.0,I kept the opened pack and returned the unopened one.
2.0,The product had small holes in the fabric. Loved the dress poor quality
2.0,My granddaughter wears a 2T and I ordered a 3T thinking she would grow into it. It is tight!!!
2.0,"I liked the inside lining, but the fur on the edges were not like the picture and the size was small even tho I got 2 size larger. Returned it immediately and received my refund asap!"
2.0,The manner in which the reading portion is applied did not work for me. It is applied to a small portion of the bottom of the lense and for me it was a big jump from the magnification to the regular lense. I prefer to simply change to a regular reading lense.
2.0,I was able to wear them twice and the lens fell out.
2.0,Gold color on it faded fast because its next to another ring. Can't even read the text on it anymore.
2.0,"These are comfortable pants, however the size that I bought was way to large. I should have noticed that the pants legs are flared at the bottom, which would be okay if they fit normally and not large. The pink fold over part isn't very big, so it doesn't fold over much. The material is thick and isn't see through which is good. These are good around the house bottoms, but not for exercise, since I bought them in a size to large."
2.0,The size is way too small.
2.0,"I was looking for another pair of black Dawgs, but right now they are extremely hard to find.  I found Terox to be similar so I ordered them.  In comparison, the Terox run smaller in size, plus they have a high arch support.  This might be good for some people, but it was too much for me and I simply couldn't walk properly in them.  I was glad too see they were made in the USA, but unhappy they didn't work for me.  I still prefer the Dawgs brand."
2.0,"I was excited about these because I have a larger than average butt and they are textured so could hide the appearance of cellulite. Unfortunately, not only did they take a month to arrive, which was not anticipated, but they fall down as soon as you start moving. Don't think about squats or bending down in these unless you wanna feel like you're showing your booty to all creation. Also they seem see through. I can't tell if you can see my panties through them and I didn't want to wake up my husband to ask. I would not recommend for work outs, only as tights with a long shirt/dress."
2.0,It runs a lil big.. tried to hem it up a little bit on the sides. But the color was  fading off the costume from touching it.
2.0,"It's a nice swimsuit, but I ordered a one-piece with tummy control and this suit does not have it."
2.0,"Super cute shirt,  but its wide"
2.0,Had crease and couldn’t get it to straighten
2.0,"Item arrived broken, good enough for the price but cheaply made, ya get what ya pay for."
2.0,"Loved the look,but went to &#34;paint&#34; it on and the spaghetti strap broke with very little effort."
2.0,"I’m a standard adult that wears hats in the “Large” size. These were so tight they were extremely uncomfortable. It mashed my nose flat and it was a struggle to blink. It didn’t feel good at all. Fortunately, my plan is to wear this as part of a cosplay and all I need is the front, so I cut a vertical slit in the back and the fit became much more relaxed and usable. But the back half of my head is now exposed. If you plan to wear just the mask, you won’t like it."
2.0,"top is GREAT. love the cut. however, the bottoms are VERY cheeky. be prepared to show most of your rear if you wear the bottoms. not for me."
2.0,Very cute but shrank alot after 1st wash. Would size up.
2.0,I like the band especially when working out but I only wore it like 3 times and part of the band is coming apart.
2.0,"Despite many reviews saying they are true to size and have “stretch” they are not. I regularly wear a large (top and bottom) with no problem, when I pulled the pants out of the bag the waist looked like it would fit one of my thighs. I proceeded to try them on because I was under the impression they had stretch ( because of the reviews) they barely went over my knees. I’m sure this product is great when you buy the correct size."
2.0,"I really liked these brackets, but they were not rapped tight and the &#34;little wrapped around ropes broke within a week."
2.0,Thin and cheaply made. I have some older Champion socks that are thicker and more satisfying.
2.0,CHEAP! WILL BREAK ON FIRST ADJUSTMENT. I would only recommend if last resort for a gift for a got fan.
2.0,"Does not fit well, looks wrinkled and Unadjustable 😞"
2.0,"Very tight fit, which stretches a he design almost to the point where it is unrecognizable, and I have narrow feet! Literally like a “tube sock”, no discernible heel. Would not purchase again."
2.0,"Made well, pretty color, but the bill of the visor is oddly short"
2.0,The shirt was small for an XL.
2.0,"Cute keychain, but I'm only giving two stars because it is NOT the right color!<br /><br />I ordered the &#34;champagne gold&#34;, which, in the photo looks like a normal, not too yellow gold color. When it arrived, however, I was surprised to find that it was a rose gold/copper color.<br /><br />*Photo attached showing keychain next to something that is ACTUALLY a gold color*"
2.0,I liked this purse until the zipper continued to split open.
2.0,I like everything about these except that they made no effort to include some kind of pouch area. They end up being terribly uncomfortable.
2.0,Would fit teens and children better than adults because the cut is narrow.
2.0,Was not linen or cotton but a synthetic fabric.
2.0,Great size and roomy but the handle came apart.
2.0,Love the looks of this shoe.  Dissapointed in sole of the shoes---the traction nubs wear off almost immediately.  Not sure how good the traction will be once winter comes.
2.0,This is very small in fit if you are busty
2.0,Not so good but suitable for the price I paid
2.0,"The mask doesn't look anything close to the picture!  You should be ashamed of yourself!  This happens all too often with Amazon these days; as an investor I am disappointed.<br />Why can't sellers be held to a higher standard?  The plastic is thin, not ""PVC"", and the gold paint and detail of the face itself is not even close to what is pictured.<br />Thanks for wasting my time and making me return it for $17."
2.0,"Cheap Looking, really thin and it doesnt fit like the picture"
2.0,"This,was too large, and the color was more of a lime green..I had to send it back.. picture was not accurate."
2.0,The fabric was very sheer and not what i expected… I was expecting it to be a dress i could wear out but it’s more of a cover up dress…
2.0,"The only things I like are the lens, and the size of the glasses for cycling. The mirror is virtually useless. I still have to use my Take A Look clip on mirrors. The rear view mirror is not tinted like my clip on ones. I tried these because I was curious mostly. I tried to return them but customer service gave me the run around, and since I had to pay the return shipping, I felt it may become a nightmare. Maybe I will use them on walks.<br />Bottom line I should have studied the reviews more."
2.0,This is not a large. It’s more a medium and the sad thing is this company doesn’t offer a XL. I love the material. I’m not overweight but I have muscle mass and this won’t work for me.
2.0,"The onesie is very loose based on size, but docking stars because that headband bow tie is definitely teensie, you won’t be able to tie it into a bow, my child is average size and I can get it around her head for a tie but not enough to make a bow. That would have really completed the outfit so too bad that it’s so short."
2.0,Fits the watch fine. The band is a little uncomfortable for me due to the thickness of the metal parts and the color doesn't match the photos.
2.0,Listing says women but tag says girls way too small
2.0,"I ordered this in a XXL. When it came it stank so bad that I had to wash it before I could even try it on, but at least it was my size. I did not put it through the dryer because I didn't want it to shrink. I finally go to try it on and I had to fight with it just to get my arms in. I ended up giving it to someone else."
2.0,This definitely  too small. If u are a size 14 don't even purchase. This must be for sizes 6/8. The feel of this was more costume  like than bathrobe  like.
2.0,Cheaply made.  I ordered a size up and it's still a little snug.
2.0,"Got these really cute puppy slippers for my precious 22 month old granddaughter (loves puppies) and she usually wears a 6, so  I got her the 5-6 and my daughter tells me her big toe is right up to the top when she got them today.. The next size which is a 6-7.5 would have been too big. I also went on the advice of a reviewer who said they run large...? Oh well, the baby really likes them and I guess she will enjoy them for a little while...a very little while. LOL!"
2.0,"this fit well and was very cute, but as soon as I left the house wearing it I noticed a hole the size of a quarter on the side of one of the legs. found this a little irritating, but the shorts were flowy enough that it wasn't entirely noticeable and I didn't have a choice to go back and change so I figured I'd just sew it back up when I got home. but then within about thirty minutes the sides where the top part is connected to the shorts started to rip. spent the whole day checking how much it was ripping and worrying my boobs would pop out.<br /><br />so, be warned."
2.0,Cheap looking. Length is good.  No way to return this dress so I can get my money back!
2.0,It is soft and cozy but HUGE. I got a large and I had downsized 1 size from my normal xl. Downsize 2 sizes
2.0,I did not like this product..
2.0,It tarnished immediately and gets all twisted up but you get what you pay for.
2.0,Shipping was fast. But I will personally never wear these. The wood material is too light and makes my lobes flare weird as a result. If you’re looking for a normal wood I would go elsewhere. Wood is so light you can dent it with your fingernails.
2.0,Fit well but the release button/switch is very uncomfortable.
2.0,This bra and panties set is pretty but picture buying it for a very very small person. The bra is very padded and the panties are high wasted which the description and photos don't portray.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, but it arrived with the deer falling off already.  I though about just fixing it myself, but retuned it instead."
2.0,"What I disliked about this suit is that, first it is very irregular, meaning one sleeve is smaller than the other. The size stated on garment does not reflect the actual size. I returned one because of this issue."
2.0,MADE NIPPLES VERY SORE
2.0,"These are very small. I'm a women's 7.5 to 8 and they barely fit, so if your foot is larger they won't work. Probably best for size 6 or smaller.  They also seem a little thin. I'm returning them."
2.0,May have been cute but size was way too small.
2.0,I am a 36C and all this did was smush my boobs flat
2.0,"The only reason I gave 2 stars was delivery was somewhat quick, but these rocks are too large , too many cracks for painting ! Not smooth at all !! Dirty !!  Very disappointed !  I thought they would have been smooth river rocks ! These ranged from 1"" to 5"" loaded with cracks !!  Never again !!"
2.0,The quality was not at all what i thought it would be
2.0,Smaller than I like
2.0,"Bought this because it claims to be surgical steel, which should not irritate the skin. It was fine at first, but after a few days the skin around my piercing became red and inflamed. After a few more, a bump developed on the piercing. True surgical steel should not cause these problems. Returning."
2.0,"My last Buxton wallet (this same style) lasted for about 15 years so I was excited to find the same style after all this time. I ordered the blue and was pleased with the color when it arrived. It was beautiful! Until I opened the wallet. My beautiful blue wallet was lined in tan!!! Deceptive and misleading description and photos, When I went back to the page I ordered from, I noticed the only photo that showed the interior of the wallet from the top is the black wallet -- none of the other colors show the expansion. Now I know why. Major disappointment."
2.0,Sooooo cute! But definitely not the size we ordered. So disappointing. We had to return them.
2.0,I ordered largest size but still too small.  Not for obese or tall people.  Scratchy textured polyester fast fashion.  Had to return it.
2.0,Returned too long
2.0,It was pretty small
2.0,cheap looking...
2.0,"Not flattering. It doesn't drape, it clings to your body. The shorts fit true to size."
2.0,Returned. The stitches were not clean. Quality was poor
2.0,"Not as long as pictured, piece came extremely tangled and has black smudges on gold."
2.0,Cute just doesn't fit
2.0,A little small. I'm 5'2 and hit above the knees. I was hoping right at the knees. Also my dress didn't come with the belt so I guess I'll be returning. It's cute just wish it was a little longer. It is comfortable at least
2.0,"The fabric was thin and cheap feeling. It reminded me of the material used to make hospital scrubs - just thinner.  Although I ordered gray, the cardigan I received was black."
2.0,"Odd fit, cheap material"
2.0,pants fit fine. Top is to small
2.0,"Very cute item, however can't get it to glow. Placed it under light for an extended period of time, still not even a slight glow from it."
2.0,I normally order an XL. This cover-up barely covered my shoulders. It seemed to be 3-4 sizes too small. The material was as expected and the pattern was cute. Just way too small.
2.0,Was very disappointed because the lace and the mesh on the dress was cut so unevenly and it was so noticeable.<br />The dress was already to short  to even be warn as a ball gown.<br /><br />The color of the dress was Ok
2.0,The concept is nice but the quality and sizing could be better. The stitching is off and poorly done.
2.0,"It did attach to my 44mm Apple Watch, but within days, the stitching began coming undone, it became very loose and I had to throw it away."
2.0,"Love the insignia - hate the build quality.  I used it on one trip and already the bottom is starting to fray.  This is almost of a &#34;disposable quality&#34; if it were not for the high price comparatively speaking.  Every now and then you run into a high price/low quality listing on Amazon - that's what this is.  I would have given it ZERO stars but damn it,...it has the USAF logo on its side!"
2.0,"The dress I received is not white with black details, as shown.  It is black with pink, white and blue details.  I do not love these colors :("
2.0,These run smaller than other brands I’ve got. They are too tight.
2.0,TOO SMALL AND IS NOT COTTON
2.0,Pretty but a lot shorter than in the picture
2.0,I returned these capris as the material was too shiny and uncomfortable
2.0,"Cheap dress, poor quality. Sequins and material falling off as soon as I took it out of the bag. Shoulders were very wide. I am petite but have wider shoulders and this was too wide for me."
2.0,Good fit but low quality.  Gets super dirty and hard to clean.
2.0,Push button came off
2.0,"Cute, but why is there only one braid???"
2.0,"Beautiful colors and comfortable, only draw back material too thin. Got them last week, wore them once and they already ripped just getting caught on my shoe."
2.0,"The sleeves are snug, on the upper arms, so that makes it NOT comfortable as a flannel should be, and feel.<br />The material is fairly thin.<br />Not impressed. NOT AT ALL WORTH THE PRICE!!!! NOT. AT. ALL."
2.0,"It was a really cute dress. It fit perfectly and the length was perfect for my height  I hated to send it back, but the stitching was not up to par at least on the dress that I was sent."
2.0,"Great sweater, except the sleeves are very itchy because they aren't lined like the rest of the sweater."
2.0,"Seller sent both the wrong dress (entirely different neckline than pictured, described) and wrong size. So, maybe the actual dress and right size would have been great—who knows? Not me. Returns are such a pain, and it’s cheap, so I won’t bother, but am annoyed at the lack of quality control"
2.0,"The pants are basically chino fabric and fit fine a little below the natural waist, but I have a 31"" inseam and the 32L rides really high! 34L did the trick, but sadly after only 4 days in the field, got caught on some briars and the twill tore. Come on! And Carhartt would only consider an exchange if I first sent the pants back so they could determine if they were worthy of exchange, but I would have to pay shipping both ways. WEAK! I ended up mending them myself, but would not recommend dealing with Carhatt over this line of ladies pants. Buyer beware"
2.0,I would give more stars but two out of the 3 came broken. The other fits just fine.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:a113f922075cc91d6d2b415f8f7cd75f]]
2.0,"Purchased this watch a little over a year ago and was really into it, but the small protective plastic cover over the sensors recently broke off for reasons I can't explain, and now there are two sharp metal pieces protruding from the watch.  I don't think it's possible to buy that cover separately, so it's doubtful the watch will get a lot of wrist time anymore."
2.0,Looks very inexpensive and the color is not very rich. I will be returning this item.
2.0,"It is poor quality, you can see through the material."
2.0,"First of all, every pair of shoes I have ever bought as an adult are size 12. These say 12, but feel like a 13, possibly even 14? That is really my only issue. I did not contact the seller about this, I just gave in and took one. But you would think for the price they should fit. I will buy a different brand next time."
2.0,I expected this to be super cute in person but it was not.
2.0,I expected a softer and a more vibrant color<br />This robe was neither.<br />I would not buy this product again.
2.0,They aight. Squish my man's giant balls though lol
2.0,"It was way too large and the arms are super long compared to the body.  However, the neck hole is very short so it doesn’t lay off the shoulder."
2.0,"I was super excited about buying these earrings, as I am very picky with jewelry for 1 and for 2 my ears are sensitive to certain metals.<br /> When I opened the package, I noticed one of my star studs needle was crooked, I ever so gently tried correcting it and the needle part snapped off! Needless to say, I’m not very impressed with the earrings. They’re cute! But very fragile and was bent when I got it :("
2.0,"This was great for the 4-5 times I got to use it. My only complaint was that I wish it was a tiny bit longer, but I have a longer-than-average torso, so I can't complain about that too much. I'm typically a L in women's shirts, and the XL fit me well.<br /><br />Then the zipper broke after about 2 weeks. So this one is going back, and I will find another brand to try."
2.0,Baja calidad en la impresión del diseño.
2.0,I thought it was a pair for my shoe boots but it was only 1 for an ankle
2.0,"Really small, won't fit my eleven year old head"
2.0,"Returned, Just wasn't what was expected."
2.0,Item was too small and not exactly what I wanted.
2.0,these are not well made. they have multiple leather strands that just end and have a loosely wrapped tie 'holding' them together which does not hold up well at all. If you want to wear these for a couple of days at the beach or going somewhere but that is it. I would guess these are ok. but they will not hold together for any time longer than a week max
2.0,First I cannot stress enough READ THE DESCRIPTION!! This is NOT a sweatshirt even though it looks like one!!!  It was much smaller than thought it would me so be sure to order a size larger!!  Bought it for my daughter she is a medium when we got it it looked like a kids shirt.  Thankfully I can give it to my granddaughter.  It is cute but not what I thought it was.  I do not like the material but if I would have read the description better I would have known that. Do not make the same mistake I did!
2.0,hard to manipulate
2.0,It did not fit my Garmin Forerunner 25. Maybe I did get the wrong band shipped to me. I will try another vendor. See photos.
2.0,Wish i had paid less since it broke in 24 hours of delivery. The snap on one side separated from the fabric.
2.0,I cannot open it!! I would love to wear it because it’s such a cool chain but impossible to open it the clasp is very tight and won’t budge.
2.0,Colors are not as bright as pictured. The material is clingy. Recommend ordering one size larger if you are looking for a looser fit.
2.0,Too thick and hideous looking. Something out of a star wars movie.
2.0,Pros: The packaging and case are really nice. The glasses look cool<br />Cons: Just by picking them up you can tell the quality is bad even at this price. I went and bought a different pair of glasses because the lenses were loose and the plastic the sits on the ridge of your nose is so narrow and rigid it causes the glasses to sit a few inches away from my face. I've never had an issue with any other pair of sunglasses.<br />Its too bad I really liked these until I held them and tried them on.
2.0,The dress looks and feels cheap. the colors don’t look like the picture. Sending back ASAP
2.0,"I ordered one, but was not the size that I had requested. 32&#34; just does not fit at all. I am thinking about ordering a different model to see if they can get the right one to me. It looks functional, but no way to tell."
2.0,This is a very cheap oversized hat. If you have a pumpkin head I'd say go for it. There has got to be a better quality hat for this price. $23 for a hat I *might* wear once is not worth it. Give me a hat I can wear daily and we'll talk.
2.0,This was not the exact dress that came in the mail. the top straps were thicker  and  came around the neck not the shoulders. I was so disappointed because it was for my daughters winter formal and didn’t have time to shop around for another dress.
2.0,YES they are see through- especially ones that have black patterns because the color inside the fabric is WHITE.  You can see this on some of the models in the pictures.  Not wearable to the gym or out of the house.
2.0,"Even though these are not necessarily tight, they somehow slip off the head after a bit of time wearing them. Pretty much useless if I want to wear them in public."
2.0,I was dissatisfied that it didn't fit
2.0,"Cheap chain, but what can you expect for an item under $10.00. The stone is too heavy for the chain though. Oh well!"
2.0,"While these sunglasses look cool are built decent, and are in fact polarized, seeing out of them sucks. They are extremely dark, more so than other polarized pairs, and the color shift is so strong, everything looks very blue and dim and they are not a pleasure to look out of at all compared to even just some shadyrays glasses. If you are going to try these, stay away from the color tint, you may have better luck then. These at least do their job functionally, but I will be donating these."
2.0,Everything fit as expected except the arms in the upper arm area.  There it was super tight.
2.0,"Really like this band, but it didn't quite go as small as I needed it to and stretched out too much after less than a month of use."
2.0,The band lasted for about 8 months then the part that holds the clasp closed broke off.  I superglued it and it held for a while.  You get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,"This is my 3rd gown from this company and I love them--soft, wash well, are really warm, and can be worn without a robe as they are not see through.  BUT, and this is a big but, I have really expensive sheets on my bed.  I had washed this red plaid gown three times, but after this time when I slept through the night, I had pick sheets and pillow cases.  So frustrating.  I like to fold my top sheet back and place my pillows on top as I make the bed.  Now I have part white and part pink sheets--so although the sheets are still comfortable, they are unsightly.  I hope the company will get this issue solved so no one else has her gown fading all over her bed linens.  At least they didn't fade on my white bedspread.  So yes I love these gowns, but beware of the red plaid one.  Like I said,  I had washed it 3 times before it faded on my sheets as I slept.  One other good thing, my living room furniture is white, so thank goodness I didn't go downstairs in my gown and sit on the upholstery.  I am going to try washing the gown by itself in vinegar because some websites say it will set the color.  One other thing, I wash in cold water, and hang to dry, so the gown was never put in a dryer.  If that doesn't keep it from fading on my sheets, I will ask the company for a refund.  Oh, another thing.  My normal size is a 14-16.  However, the only sizes left when I bought my 2nd gown was a 4X.  The 3rd gown--the red plaid--was only available in a 2X.  Actually, all 3 gowns work; however, the 4X sleeve hang about 1"" past my finger tips.  Being so huge, though, it is like having another blanket on really cold nights.  So, if your size isn't available, sizing up actually worked for me, and may for you.  I could easily wrap the 4X around me twice, but, hey, at my age I go for comfort, not beauty."
2.0,"This is a very cute suite, the material is nice as well. Unfortunately, I am not able to wear it and see if it is actually worth the money I have spent on it. I purchased this suite in a size small, I am 110lbs 5'3&#34; I wear a 34B so according to the size chart this suite should fit me perfectly. Well, it was no where near close to fitting, the suite didn't even make it to the top of my torso. It was pretty much child size. I requested a return with the company to get my money back. Which came from china, they were polite and prompt with communication. They asked me what the issue was, I told them, they responded asking again if it would possibly fit or if I would be willing to give it away as a gift. They suggested I do so because I will have to pay all the shipping to return it back to China and they have already made no profit because of competitive prices. It was an awkward encounter with a business that I rather not experience again. I understand their argument but people expect what they pay for and if you are going to advertise certain sizes then you should be held accountable."
2.0,Too flimsy for me
2.0,I wasn't expecting purple:(<br />Bottoms fit awkward
2.0,"Not sure if these are a knockoff.  I have over 30 pair of silver forest earrings, they are of great quality, these are not.  Paint over lay, and dull looking, not silver forest quality.  They also have a sticker on the back of silver forest tag, when you save five of them you get a free pair.  Sticker was removed!  Shipping was fairly fast."
2.0,"Silver plating wore off after awhile, doesn't look good at all any more. It was nice while it lasted, A waste of money."
2.0,"My personal measurements happen to fit the straight size and it was still way too big. Very unflattering on the waist, you would need to buy a ribbon as a belt. It was hard to get in to and extremely heavy. Not good for summer or spring events."
2.0,"Not even close to the quality I expected. They smelled like petroleum and, after one wash, shriveled into faded wads I could barely get on my feet. Bummer."
2.0,Really cute and comfy BUT the arms are really short.
2.0,"Disappointing. Basically, it casts a yellow hue on what was previously white or clear lights."
2.0,"Disappointed to find that elastic only extends across ONE side of the front, so it looks really amateur - look very closely at the photo.  I never wear it."
2.0,"I had the the red and navy striped scarf on my wish list.  Received it yesterday for my birthday.  The color is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  I intentionally had the scarf on my wish list, as it had red in it and wanted to wear it with a red cardigan.  While the scarf is nice, I have so much already in aqua and pink and was trying to venture. out.  Very disappointed in them shipping the wrong scarf.  The close up picture is the one I received, while the other is the one that was on my Amazon wish list.  Quite a difference."
2.0,It is a Beautiful ring until worn!!<br />I purchased this as a gift believing Sterling Silver would be best for teenager. It turned her finger Green! So Embarrassed!!
2.0,its super heavyweight itchy material. zippers kept snagging on skin and hairs. possibly the most unpleasant piece of clothing ive had to wear. looks nice tho lol
2.0,"I thought it would have been heavier, even though it wasn't silver but it felt very ""weak"". It's pretty and all but not a sturdy piece of jewelry."
2.0,"I took the gloves out of the package and the Velcro strap just fell off ,they are not good quality and pretty disappointing overall :("
2.0,Product was dirty when i got them
2.0,"It didn't look anything like the picture. Looked cheap and very fake.  I have smaller legs and this looked hilarious on me!! It wouldn't even stay pulled up.  Not a good product. Good idea, but not for me."
2.0,Not good don't buy way to small
2.0,This runs small and is super thin- almost see thru. Do not buy this if you’re looking for warmth.
2.0,"Pretty but not as dark as it appears here. Much lighter, more like a yellowish green, Maybe others are darker.<br />I wanted as it appears almost emerald. I returned it."
2.0,The shoe is very cheaply made it was appearant. When I received the product the shoe lining was loose and I had to re-glue it. The clip for the shoe is probably the worst thing on this shoe. It’s a hook not an ordinary clip. The support for your foot is not there. I felt like my ankle was going to twist at any minute.
2.0,"I was so excited to find this style, was just what I was looking for. Unfortunately they didn’t last long before the chain broke off if one of the earrings. Insert sad face."
2.0,Not a great product from my view.  Lost one of my favorite earrings on first use.  Very disappointing
2.0,I’m a 34DD and ordered the 8-10 size and the chest was extremely big. Bath suit was cute just didn’t fit so if your smaller on top than the  bottom then not a good fit
2.0,"Not that well made, but for the price..."
2.0,Its a great style but the material is thin so it looks a little cheap... but you get what you pay for.
2.0,Plastic feeling and too big. We're not natural looking at all.
2.0,"Runs small at the waist. No a fan of the fastener, I prefer snap or button, not a hook and bar."
2.0,"The watchband has a very distinctive appearance.  It can be considered both dressy and casual.  However, the latching mechanism is quite weak.  It only takes a very minimum touch before it opens.  I have to re-engage the latch/clasp constantly throughout the day.  It became such an unbearable annoyance that I replaced the band entirely."
2.0,"I get that Hanes makes all kinds of socks, but I bought these to replace (what I thought were the same socks) that were finally wearing out. These socks are made of a thinner material, and have worn through in only a couple of months of use. I'm moving on from these"
2.0,"It's very cute, however it did not fit to size. I ordered a XXL, I wear a 16. I had to resell it, the girl I sold it to wears a size Medium. It fit her a little snug."
2.0,These are not actual size and they are all different sizes
2.0,It looks just like what it is.  Cheap looking and rather gaudy.
2.0,Super cute jacket. But the pockets have already ripped
2.0,These flimsy laces will likely not last long. I don't like them but I put them on my old hunting boots that I don't wear that often.  Better than nothing but not what i was hoping for.
2.0,"They seem nice at first, but I've worn mine maybe 4 times and the seams up top are gone.  Idk if I got a bad one or what.  Warm, comfortable, but bad seams."
2.0,it is just too complicating.
2.0,Made in India. Not too vet friendly.
2.0,"These look ok, but they have pleats in them which I wasn't expecting."
2.0,"Initially we really like it, but within a month velcro stopped working and now it just comes off my babies feet with any small action."
2.0,"I like the style of these leggings. I really wanted to rock them. They seem so stylish buuuuttt.... the material is so so sooooo thin. There is no support for anything. Booty jiggle everywhere, feels like im naked 😆 and let me say I love my cellulite but I don't want it to be outlined when i have leggings on. The dimples show too and I just can't handle that much show. They make good pajama pants."
2.0,Size is not accurate.
2.0,this was supposed to be a tank/dress.....well i ordered a size larger & unfortunately it barley fit as a short shirt.....VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
2.0,The ear loops are way off causing ears to bend forward and cause soreness behind the ears.
2.0,"The photo clearly shows a long fit. I get the same style from Target to wear as undershirts, because they are long enough to tuck in. Thought I was saving a few bucks by buying these, but they are no longer than your average t-shirt.<br /><br />The quality of the shirt seemed pretty good otherwise. Just be advised about the length."
2.0,"It sucks, its a floppy hat that leaves indentions on your forehead if you wear it backwards, and you cant wear it forward cause its floppy af"
2.0,"Very strange cut. It sits really low on the chest. This would work for those that are extremely short waisted. Or, for someone that is screaming for attention and wants to show extra extra.....extra skin."
2.0,Like: the cut/shape<br />Dislike: quality of fabric is poor. It's black die on the outside ajd the inside is white. I'm concerned about colour fading after each wash.
2.0,"I’m 5’8” and about 225 pounds & pregnant- this shirt is HUGE. I’m guessing it would very easily fit a 450 pound person, with room. It’s very long as well, I’m tall and it hits at about my knees, even w/my baby bump. The material is very cheap and thin (the weight is actually great for pregnant summer layering) it doesn’t feel worth the price though, and the print is very different than the photo. Wouldn’t buy again- and may end up donating this one as a dress up costume to a local theater."
2.0,"This is a really cheap, see through shirt. I'm keeping it, but it's not as I expected."
2.0,Will return.  The crease that goes down center is uncomfortable on  your face.  If you flip it in and put the crease on the outside it looks weird.
2.0,Not bad sports bras for the price. Ran a tad small and the removable cups bunch up and look awful
2.0,These do not stay on my face/nose. They slide down. I would not buy them again.
2.0,"Started to completely fall apart the 3rd time I used it. Cheap material and stitching and not very strong. Its cute, but defenitly cheap."
2.0,"They were cute, a little bigger than expected. Unfortunately they both went missing out of my daughter's ears within a week and no she doesn't touch them."
2.0,Did not seem real to me.  Zipper seemed cheap and leather not soft like the real COACH.
2.0,"The heart in the picture looks like a nice pendant necklace. However when I received it, it was micro miniature.<br />Very disappointing as i thought I would wear this on valentines day as a statement piece.  Returning"
2.0,"I was in search of a good standard white blouse and was pretty disappointed when I opened the package.  Material is super thin and has an odd texture - reminds me of those disposable paper gowns you wear when you go to the doctor for a checkup.  Looks cheap compared to photos; there was no pant line or bra showing underneath shirt in photos, so I was hopeful to find a fairly full-coverage white blouse - not the case, very sheer.  Also the arm 'ties' are just not working for me - I thought it was a button of some sort, but it is a couple of silver hooks you have to feed the arm loop through to pull them up, so it also looks kinds silly if you want to occasionally wear your sleeves down; there will be random hanging metal pieces that clang around."
2.0,Color is Heather gray!<br />Will be returned.<br />Order usual size because on the bright size the shirt is nice...Looks comfy too.
2.0,Seems tight around the shoulders. Fabric is a bit scratchy.
2.0,You have to go up 2 to 3 sizes. These shirts are much too small.
2.0,Tassels are not balanced so they don’t hang properly
2.0,"This bathing suit is beautiful, as described. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 132 pounds. I picked the size 8-10. As I pulled it on I could hear seams ripping. I could also hear seams ripping as I pulled it off. No evidence of gaping seams, but this suit is cheaply made. The bottom is (as other reviewers have described) very loose. I don't intend to wear another suit over the bottom (as others have done). I will likely attempt to sew some tucks to make it a bit smaller, and will likely only wear this once. This suit may fit a large bottomed woman, but I doubt the suit would hold up to be pulled over an ample rump. Don't be fooled by the beauty. Don't waste your money unless you plan to do some sewing repairs."
2.0,Not good for large bust!
2.0,Terrible; the bands do not stay on glasses!  Then they break if you try to twist them around twice.
2.0,came out all the time.
2.0,Is OK  looks a bit on the cheap side
2.0,"Short and stiff.  Maybe after use they would loosen up, but because of the length, I will be returning."
2.0,The she’s fit very nice at first but have stretched so much I can’t wear outside. I have issues with my foot rolling and bought them for this reason. I wear around the house. I don’t recommend these if you need good support. They are cute and are now my cute slippers
2.0,"Its really cute and is just like the image, but...  the white enamel had popped out before it arrived.  Will try some epoxy to bond it back into place, but that is a fundamental flaw in the product."
2.0,"Silver is way too white for my liking I thought It was a normal metallic, also really thin and small"
2.0,Lens started out being just fine then started losing tint around the edges
2.0,"These Earrings are so small  that both earrings and the backs fit on an American  Penny. The backs will not go onto the posts. I bent one, trying to put the backs onto a earring post. Was they supposed to be  so small? I have a hard time holding on to them."
2.0,It’s Okay
2.0,"I thought this was supposed to be a sweatshirt, but it's like a cheap polyester type material. The print was nice and vibrant and I loved the colors but the material was awful. It did seem true to size also. I returned it."
2.0,The wrong one came! Not sending it back though because it looks pretty cute on me.
2.0,how the waist fit like a medium but suppose to be a xl smh
2.0,Nice but to bulky
2.0,"It is a beautifull patterned dress. It isn't really fitted for women who may be top heavy. Material feels great. Color is vivid. If you are over 5'8, this dress will not hit the floor. It has great stretch though."
2.0,No es la calidad esperada
2.0,"This dress is very cute but even though I used the recommended measurements and bought my regular size, it was huge on me. At 5'7, 130 lbs, a small should have fit me. I had to return it and unfortunately they don't have a size smaller than that."
2.0,Ring was a little bent when I received it. The stone came out before I got to wear it.
2.0,"love the design, looks great in the picture, but, it's WAY too small...ordered 2 sizes larger than I usually wear and it was still too small"
2.0,"I like the tag but it is not like the picture, my tag that I got does not have the bottom part of the football on the tag."
2.0,The cardigan that you view on Amazon is not the one I received. The first one I got was way to small and wasn’t the one that was shown. So I ordered three sizes larger and it fit.  And again it wasn’t the one shown.  It’s pretty but I would have rather had the one shown.  But I’ll keep this one.
2.0,I liked these sandals but they were tight in some areas and rubbed.  Sorry that I had to return them.
2.0,The fabric was cheaper than expected but I did like the design. But I think it would look ok on someone tall. I’m 5’2” and it drowned me.
2.0,"So this bathing suit fit great but it wasn't made right. It's not ruffled when wearing it, It fits good but there isn't enough fabric on the edges to make it cute. Just looks frumpy."
2.0,"This hat is not as attractive as seen in pictures. I don't know if it's the way it arrived (all crooked) or is the color but really doesn't look good quality.<br /> It looked like had good coverage  though, but maybe in another color would justify the price."
2.0,The writing is unreadable and the mask material is sweaty satin like.  Wouldn't buy again
2.0,"First impression - texture is nice and not thin. I liked the colors. My son used 1 set twice, and one day he came from school and sat down. He was in his thermals only and when he stretched his legs the pants ripped in the middle. I was disappointed that happened after using it 2 times."
2.0,Maybe this just doesn't look good on my hands but I really didn't find it to be attractive or comfortable. I haven't worn it since I purchased it.
2.0,Pants to small for an xl looks like small and the jacket was ripped bad
2.0,Product arrived with a hole in it. Poorly made
2.0,Loved wearing this every day with my on guard essential oil but it broke a month after purchase
2.0,Nice flattering cut but the quality of the material is not worth the price. Wouldn't pay more than $8 for this
2.0,"I usually take reviews with a grain of salt unless they’re overwhelmingly negative which is why I ordered this even though some people said it fit weird. It does fit weird. The arm holes are almost too small or too high or something, and it’s very loose at the bottom. I am skinny but it’s just very unflattering, I expected it to be just a little more form fitting. The material is decent, anyway."
2.0,These are very thin. I would not buy again.
2.0,"Cheap, shiny, stretchy material. Not at all the type of fabric I expected."
2.0,"This is a nice light hoodie with a plush hood. The pocket in the front for my hands is really nice and the thumb holes on the arms are great.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the drawstring to keep them in the pouch doesn't work. I already replaced it once for the same issue. It won't be resolved as this is a quality issue based on the design. The tightening component simply doesn't work. I consider this a safety hazard for my pet, hence the 2 star rating."
2.0,I purchased this for my Sister birthday gift a week later the medallion fell off she was very sad because we wear these according to our Spirituality
2.0,"Love the characters,  but dislike the fit .shorts too long.."
2.0,The watch looks super cool but doesn't keep accurate time.
2.0,"I would not know, as you sent me a size 10.  I will be returning this as soon as I can get a label.  I also will be getting another brand as this did not meet my expectations."
2.0,"The jack came without button holes! When l reloaded at the original photo, the jacket had wholes. Maybe I received a defective one!"
2.0,Did not last long before falling apart.
2.0,"Very cute shoes but this picture was taken after 3 weeks of wear. Not very durable for normal walking usage. Also the ankle straps velcro don't do the job, come undone often while walking."
2.0,I didn’t like that in the picture they show they have a post but they actually hook on your ear an that’s what I didn’t want .
2.0,Much smaller than average.  I gave mine away as their was no way they would be comfortable to wear.  Order a size up!
2.0,"Fabric quality is poor, upper arm grip also not firm"
2.0,Was supposed to be for a valentine dance. Returned it immediately. Was rembursed promptly.
2.0,They did not fit the watch correctly. The pins were to lose.
2.0,Ce in awesome time but it runs small.
2.0,"Cute earring, bite too large for a child’s lobe."
2.0,"Good quality but not as high waisted as photo. I am a 5'5"" 185pound with naturally big bootie and an XL keeps sliding down at zumba or even on the treadmill at the gym."
2.0,"I LOVED this watch. I wore this model for 5 straight years without removal - maybe a every few months to clean - took showers with it, swam in the ocean, swimming in pools, etc. It held up like a champ; I never had a problem with it. The day/dates/alarms function and layout is simply the best. Alas, the rubber wrist strap eventually broke and I had to buy a new one.<br /><br />I've purchased four of these watches in the past year. Unfortunately within a couple of weeks of showering with it on, the face starts to fog up with moisture. It eventually turns into water drops and the face dies.  I loved this watch so much that I bought three more, hoping that I got a dud. I live in Philadelphia and it was a humid summer. I made sure not to shower in the watch to prevent the moisture build-up, but the humidity alone - and perhaps very minimal splashing from hand-washing? - caused moisture to sneak into the watch face. I am very upset that I cannot wear this model any longer and will have to find an alternative that is more water resistant. I've never left reviews but I truly did love this watch and my heart is too broken to keep quiet.<br /><br />It hurts me to advise that folks should stay away from this item."
2.0,I have had croc flip flops for years and they have changed the rubber... now it's a plastic rubber. NOT THE QUALITY it used to be.
2.0,Nice look but fall off easy! Don't use for activity!
2.0,Band falls off from my Luxe very easily and I am always afraid that I will lose my device.  I cannot wear the silicon bands since they irritated my skin.
2.0,"Bought this is a gift for my mother in law, ended not giving it to her because the back of the &#34;Mom&#34; piece had a fault with the finish.  It looked like maybe another piece was on top of it during the chroming process and it ended up with a nasty mark on the back.  Sadly I missed my window to return it.  Really would've like to exchange it, but life happens and I missed out.<br /><br />The item itself look like it will last a while, just not happy with the quality of the finish."
2.0,Wish the earrings themselves were longer. It’s hard to push a back through the piercing when it has no point at the end of it.
2.0,"The shorts seemed ok, but the seem holding the two sections together was really scratchy on the legs. It made the shorts unwearable for me."
2.0,"The cat ring looks nothing like the photo, it looks like a worm with arms"
2.0,I like design but when I was wear it its so big the straps!
2.0,"The shoe itself is great, fits well with a little extra wiggle room on my 13 month old with giant feet (bought 18-24 months) I feel the product picture was misleading. The shoes pictured on amazon are grey with a darker grey dog. The shoes I got in the mail today (delivered on time) are WHITE with a midi I’m grey dog. These were bought to be play around the house shoes and I would have never purchased white for my little guy... he’s a walking disaster."
2.0,"My daughter bought these for herself and her boyfriend who is away in college.  His broke the first week he was away, hers broke about a month later.  Great concept, and they loved them initially.  Not sturdy at all."
2.0,"Swimsuit looks great, but I ordered size small (medium would be listed on tag, according to description) but received a swimsuit with large on the tag and clearly too big for my daughter who wears a small. This happened once and I figured it was a mistake. I returned the item and ordered a small a second time - and they sent a large again!"
2.0,Came as 2 parts. No way my toddler would get it on.
2.0,"The stones are pretty dark, and not catching light really well, so look like black diamonds when in ears, not blue. If your other blue diamonds are dark or if you are not trying to match to brighter blue collections- it's a good deal for gold and 1/2 carat diamonds and a nice looking earrings in general. Just not as sparkly and not as blue as I was hoping for- so I sent them back."
2.0,Really cute...but broke really easy...
2.0,Didn’t like them on me. The pants were too big and long. I’m short and wear a small. They looked cuter on the model but realized she had long legs. The  material is nice so perhaps a taller lady would like these PJ’s
2.0,Cheaply made.  The ends aren’t even sewn.  I could have bought a piece of material and done better.  I think I will!
2.0,Only wore a few times never in rain and one shoe doesn’t charge or light up. Cost more to return.
2.0,Cute. Cheaply made and fell apart within an hr of putting on with our person stuck inside  It also would not stay inflated. This was being used for a Christmas Carnival for Foster Children. Very sad and disappointing. 💔
2.0,The chain started to change after two days not water proof.. Don't recommend wearing in water. Still a pretty chain
2.0,"It's cute，but the hinge is too short for a large earlobe, a little bit hard to wear and ear hurts...<br /><br />Update: I ‘m not sure if it’s real sterling silver, because I have metal allergies and sterling silver is one of exceptions, however this huggies redden my ears and make them swelling and itchy."
2.0,This style is not flowy as described and it's not a tunic. It's definitely more fitted than it appears because the bottom is not as wide as it seems in the picture and it's the same length as a normal shirt. Not what I thought I ordered.
2.0,"Nice hat, but the seller packaged the hat into an undersized box which crushes the front of the hat. Always seems to be the case when buying hats on Amazon. Returned"
2.0,"I have stopped wearing them because the dye comes off all over me and anything that I have on.  I have tried to clean off the excess, but no matter how many times I have wiped them, it still gets on my face if I happen to touch it. They are a quality made item and very warm. Disappointing!"
2.0,"Gave this item 2 stars because it is cute, however I ordered a Large as suggested and it definitely did not fit like a large at all. I would recommend sizing up one or two sizes as this seems to run pretty small. Will be returning item"
2.0,The uniform is great but they forgot to send the belt
2.0,Thy r cute and the right size but thy r way to small in the inside to fit my babys chubby foot in I dnt recommend them.
2.0,Im not that impressed with the top. Its a lot longer than it looks in the picture. Very cheaply made.
2.0,"Cute, but cheaply made. I wore this dress for less than five hours to Easter dinner. When I took it off, the seams had ripped in two different areas, even though it was loose and didn't press the seams. Also stuck to me with static and the thin material made it feel like my butt wasn't covered so I had to keep checking myself."
2.0,The ripped between my thighs while working out. Got a replacement & experienced the same thing. Don’t recommend.
2.0,"Although these booties are adorable , well made and fashion forward they are too small. The interior is lined with a velvety fleece, not fur. They are attractive. But they run easily a size small. This is frustrating and inconvenient. I live in an isolated area. Returns are bc a hassle. The nearest UPS store is over 68 miles away. Of course I could spend my day waiting for a UPS man who won't show up. Seems that it is long overdue for manufacturer's to rely on standard sizing guides and save cystomers the aggravation, irritation and disappointment."
2.0,It's an ok dress but see though
2.0,"I ordered the 8"" bracelet. I always get 8"" and they always fit. It fit around my wrist just fine, but I was unable to fasten it closed.  I tried and tried , but to no avail. I decided to give it as a gift to a German friend of mine who has smaller wrists.  It is a very pretty bracelet. I was VERY disappointed that I could not close it!!"
2.0,"the embroidery and design were great. if you only want to use this for 1 winter you can. however, after washing it a couple times the material starts to get little fuzzies hanging off the whole beanie therefore will not be in a good condition for next winter."
2.0,Cute but for a size “0”
2.0,Theyre really kinda nice but unless you wear Harry Potter or Ben Franklin glasses they certainly don't fit over glasses as stated and the reason I bought them. They're going back.
2.0,Material too hard for baby’s skin... probably won’t buy it again
2.0,I ordered a size smaller than usual as suggested but this dress was huge! It could have fit two people at once.
2.0,Had to return it. The printing looks really cheap even though the shirt fabric is really soft.
2.0,"In the description, it says ""soft-knit"" with ribbed cuffs and neckline.  It was entirely ribbed, with no stretch, and very thin.  Due to the fabric difference, it was not quite as large as I would have liked to wear it.  You get what you pay for I guess, just beware it is not the product in the picture (charcoal gray)."
2.0,Wanted to love this so bad
2.0,Blurry and pixelated
2.0,"The belt is still functional, but my belt came in rusty. It look as if i bought it from a garage sale."
2.0,the band part slips right off
2.0,Zippers do not stay zipped. Fit is good and material is comfortable but if the zippers don’t work it’s useless
2.0,I got these for myself an my best friend. They looked very nice coming out of the packaging but unfortunately didn't last too long. The silver parts turned to brass after only a week of wear and one of the ends of the rope fell off. The magnets are super strong and stick to just about everything. I liked the look but they are not for every day use.
2.0,Received my hat today and straight out of the box the hat was broken in several spots and bent beyond repair. Photos included.
2.0,"I was excited about this suit, but the material is thinner than I wanted, not as sturdy as most ""athletic"" suits. It also was wider than it was tall. I'm returning it as it barely covered my chest. I got a large size, since I usually wear size 10. It was wide enough, but it was built for someone more around 5 foot, not 5'6 or taller. I'm dissapointed and am returning mine. I read other positive reviews and was hopeful. :("
2.0,This dress was SUPER cute but the chest was way too big. ROMWE was made for girls with bigger chests.
2.0,comes a pack of 4 XL size but all of them fit different sleeves to short and some to big no make sense
2.0,The material is polyester and drapes well (it would … see next part). And the design is stunning. The issue with this is the fit guide posted does NOT make sense (see picture). An Extra extra large is a 19” chest ? I figured it would be a typical 18-20 but it was still too tight. It’s not 19” but I’d guess an more of a size 14?
2.0,"Cute designs.. but cheaply made, and they look like it."
2.0,"After reading the reviews, I got a size larger than I usually wear and it is still a bit snug. Material is unthreading all over. Will work for my needs, but not great."
2.0,They’re very warm and I’m happy with them. I’m upset that my order was late and I only got one pair when I ordered three.
2.0,"Really cute but hair gets stuck and pulled out, super painful."
2.0,The legs were HUGE! I can't walk in them without the fabric all going between my legs and super uncomfortable. Sending back.
2.0,"Ordered these about a half size larger than normal based on the reviews seen on this site. The size delivered was correct, but the sandals are extremely narrow, especially since where the bands connect to the base is far in from the side. Also, the bar between the toes was very uncomfortable - but this may be because the overall fit was so poor. Returned, will look elsewhere."
2.0,Love the style but shirt holsr have string u
2.0,Cute but too small. Always hate to have to pay to send back items that don't work out when they aren't sized correctly on their size chart.
2.0,"I specifically ordered this watch band with the CURVED ENDS as it is listed and shown in the picture, yet I received one with Straight Ends. I was quite disappointed when I received it in the mail for that reason.<br /><br />I had a previous bad experience with a watch band within the past month with another seller, I don't feel like going through that hassle again to get the correct one, so I'll just keep this one.<br /><br />However, the straight end version fits my watch and the band itself is very attractive, so I will add one star to my review. I purchased this for a Casio MDV-106.<br /><br />Also to note: I have a 6.5 inch wrist and after removing all the links possible it is still somewhat loose on my wrist; if I was able to take off one more link it would fit perfect."
2.0,Fits strange. Looks like super long t shirt
2.0,This material comes off onto everything even after washing it numerous times. It is very warm but that is the only good thing about it.
2.0,"Good idea but in reality not very useful. More often than not the claws are in the way. I am right handed and bought the set to have claws on my left hand only. This is a good way to do it, as one hand is free to do normal things, while I can dig with my left. When the claw glove is on you can not do anything at all with that hand except dig or rake. So basically the gloves are somewhat of  a handicap. If you purchase them keeping that in mind, then you will like them. If you purchase them expecting to be versatile, you will be disappointed. Well made and put together, seem like they will last."
2.0,I ordered both a large and extra large (even though I wear a large) because I wanted to make sure it was roomy. The extra large was way too tight. It  is good for a spring day but definitely not for winter. Way too thin for winter. The sleeves are also too narrow to wear anything long sleeved under it. I really wanted to like it but it didn't meet my needs (or fit).
2.0,I did not like the bracket because it makes your face sweaty when wearing. Not comfortable at all.
2.0,"I live in Arizona. I bought this shirt to wear during my bicycle rides. I was looking for a shirt to proteckt me from the sun, which this shirt does. But also I wanted a light weight, breathable, moisture wicking shirt that would keep me cool and dry during my rides. Just right now I tested it out: I went on a 1h 15m bike ride ( in the evening @10 pm....so it wasn't as hot as it would have been if I went in the morning) and let me tell you,  this shirt is NOT BREATHABLE, NOT LIGHTWEIGHT, DOESN'T KEEP YOU DRY AND COOL, like it claimes it does. In fact, it was the opposite; the shirt made me feel like I was in a sauna, it made me sweat so much ( I have never  sweat this much in any other shirt  before). It is not breathable at all and it wasn't wicking moisture how it supposed to do.. All the sweat was trapped inside and dripping down my body, no air could pass through this fabric. ( see pictures  above, have sweat marks).If you looking for a shirt to make you sweat, then this is it.  I have other shirts, that truly are breathable, light weight and keep  you cool and dry.<br />I will still keep it, because it's only $20.00 and I like the color, the design  is nice, makes you look nice. I like the thumb holes and I will use it to do some yard work and for colder Arizona months."
2.0,Dress was different then what was pictured no bow as well
2.0,"Great size for a child, not so much for an adult"
2.0,"I was disappointed in how large this cover is.  It looks like a 3x and I wear between a medium and large depending on the style and cut.  The quality is really good and I like the pouch that comes with it.  This is perfect for plus size women.  I had to return for a refund, which was disappointing."
2.0,The hat doesn't look as good as the model.
2.0,"Quality looks so-so. Purchased a size 2-3 for my daughter that is a size 3, and the shoes are too large. I'm a size 4 (big kid size) and they fit me... Also, one shoe was visibly wider than the other..."
2.0,It said footless but they were just regular tights which my daughters can always use so I didn't return. But I had hoped they were footless.
2.0,It had to be Reggie’s by the time I got it ! I purchased a project!
2.0,Runs at least 3 sizes smaller
2.0,They were made ou5 of very thin knit. Looks like made very cheap. I also felt the pants would not flatter any figure. You can literally see through material.
2.0,"This is not a full size wallet, you can not fit a checkbook in it"
2.0,"I  thought I was in love with these socks. Nice fit for a size 8 foot, the little non-skid beads are not as annoying as some. But the fuzz they give off is ridiculous. I washed them all inside out to get rid of it, but its still everywhere. I'm constantly picking it off something...the carpet, the floors, my sheets, my feet. Tonight I wore the black ones and made the mistake of taking them off while on the bed...thus the picture, and i had more in my hand! Its really too bad, I really need comfortable non skid socks to wear at home."
2.0,"Love the buckle design. Purchased in February of 2019 and only worn less than a dozen times, and the part that attaches to the belt broke off."
2.0,Ring did fit very well but look to cheap to wear. Needs work and improvement on materials used.
2.0,"I did really like this when it arrived, it fit great and and was stylish. But only a few weeks later the black outer layer is starting to peel away, exposing a brown under layer. Definitely hoped it would last longer."
2.0,I love these earrings! They're beautiful. However the Pearl ball barely stays on the end of one of the earrings. It's already fallen off once. Luckily I found it!
2.0,"Everyone is different, but these did not fit me well. The strap between the toes is hard rubber and not comfortable. There is no cushion support in the bottom part of the Sandel. The upper foot supports are also hard rubber. Not for me."
2.0,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order 2 sizes up.  I purchased an XL for my 34 C chest.  Although the bra technically fit (funny bc I usually wear an XS in shirts), it was WAY TO LOW CUT to actually work as a sports bra.  I had even more cleavage going on than the girl in the photo, and as soon as I did my first downward-dog, there was a serious nip-slip.  This may be a cute and functional bra for someone with an A or B cup-size, but C and up will pose an issue."
2.0,Not true to size. It is too small.
2.0,"Cute styling, however, order up at least one size!  Hand washed and line dried<br />but it shrank and is now too small.  Workmanship isn't great and neither is fabric."
2.0,"Size is completely off, I know Converse sizes are different than regular but we went down 2 sizes and the shoes still fit  way too big."
2.0,"If I only knew...it's a thin piece of metal. The graphics are only on one side. the key ring is cumbersome. Love the idea, not a fan of the execution."
2.0,The zipper broke after wearing it only one time.
2.0,SLips up
2.0,"Runs small, couldn't pull up calf."
2.0,Order up 3 sizes
2.0,Total disappointment. They look good but one of its sides broke withouth any logic reason. Not even 2 months using them...
2.0,The dress is nice but the second time I wore it the zipper broke and it is no longer wearable.
2.0,wrinkle and flat
2.0,"The picture makes the quality a lot better than it is. I understand it’s not a expensive piece but the skull is very cheesy, the pendent and chain are also very light."
2.0,well made and very pretty but runs entirely too small.  You may have to order 1 or 2 sizes larger.
2.0,"Stiff, poor quality material- not the soft pebble high quality look you expect from KS"
2.0,"I liked it when I saw it online, and I liked it when I opened it (although it's a bit shinier than I like) , but it falls short when I use it. I like a wallet that stands up in my bag, so that I can quickly stick a card, receipt, or change in with one hand. This one keeps toppling over, even though it has a pretty wide base. I literally have to pull it out of my bag to put anything in. Too bad, because it does have a ton of room."
2.0,Small earrings
2.0,"I will preface this by reminding the reader that this costume costs $50. Truthfully it is no different from anything else in the $20-$30 range… Loose threads, unfinished seams, poor quality work overall. One of the skull embellishments already fell off after my daughter has been wearing this for 30 minutes.  If this is the look you’re going for, it is hard to find it elsewhere. But be low with your expectations  in relation to the cost."
2.0,Just don’t do it.
2.0,The strap is not as long or as thick as I’d like and the colors aren’t as vibrant as I expected them to be.
2.0,"So sad .. Fit too small from the top piece , the bottom piece was too big . 🙄🙄"
2.0,It was great when we first received it. But after a blazing heat this past summer both side shade start to warp. We didn’t use much after. It is a good concept but need to find a better material to resist direct sunlight.
2.0,color around neck - not as pictured - returned due to this.
2.0,Mostly very small or not.fitting right... they kept flying off my fingers.  THe small was too small and too big to fit on slimmer parts of your finger.
2.0,"I was impatiently waiting for this shirt to arrive. I loved the design in the picture. However when It showed up, I was disappointed. The craftsmanship of the design of the shirt is poorly done. The holes look like someone cut the fabric with regular scissors. The holes were even but had loose threads and were turning into itself. Very much like what would happen if you cut the bottom of your favorite t-shirt with some dull scissors or knife. Although the holes were perfectly aligned it looked like I had did it myself. Maybe if they had sewn the edges of each hole it would make the shirt looks 100x better. The shirt is also small to size. I bought an XL but the shirt fit my XS daughter. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
2.0,That’s a dress is disappointing. The cutouts under the arms are not the same size and it’s cut is just off.  The wrap top opening sags and has too much slack where the bottom stitch is at the waist so there’s no structure and the material just flops.<br /><br />I got my usual size which has always been the same in this brand but unfortunately not with this dress. The material is also cheap looking so not a good dress in my opinion.
2.0,Uncomfortable. Pulled against our ears.
2.0,I got one that looks like the photo and one that is bigger and doesn't match
2.0,"I do not believe this bag is real leather.  There is no ""leather smell at all.  I own several leather purses/bags and they always have that distinct leather smell.  Although bag was packaged in a plastic bag with tissue paper covering bag, the straps were tucked inside the tote instead of being left outside.  The straps have permanent bent areas which make the bag appear cheap.  Size is good and will use to tote items to work that I don't want in my purse.  The only good thing is I was able to clip a 20% coupon so the bag was a reasonable price.  Sorry....just do not believe this is leather."
2.0,"Really awkward fit. The adjustable straps don't stay adjusted, the dress is super baggy yet tight through the bosom. Really odd."
2.0,"This was dirty day one, and I've tried to clean it, not happening.  Liked the look but now its dirty and looks cheap, so I will have to buy a different one."
2.0,I purchased these mittens for my 20 month old nephew and they were too small.  The size says 1-2 yrs old and he can't get his hand inside of them. The mittens were made up well and are probably warm.  These mittens would probably fit an infant from 9-12 months old.  I was very dissapointed because I had to buy him a different set of gloves.  I'll probably give them to someone who has a child around 1 yr old.
2.0,Cheap material feels like plastic !<br /><br />No movement on the arms held by a piece of string 😠<br />Which led the arm wraps rip on both sides<br />Awful
2.0,"I bought the Xlarge men, the shirt didn’t fit my husband at all. But it fit me perfectly and I’m a size medium in females."
2.0,"Not good quality and I have to cut so many hanging thread.  I will update with pics.  This is a definite, you get what you paid for."
2.0,I loved this earring for my Tragus. It looked perfect.  But I COULD NOT get it to screw. I asked everyone in my household to try to help me but no one could do it. Which made it unusable...bummer
2.0,"If you buy a case for an expensive automatic, you want the winder to look good enough to house the watch. this one doesn't."
2.0,Ordered the darkest wash and the jeans looked more like the medium. I’m 5’4” and there is no way they could have been ankle length jeans (as shown) even when rolled up.
2.0,"I feel like a brick in this dress. The arms fit as expected, and it looks cute in theory, but it has NO shape. It might look cute with a waist belt, but I don't have one, so I'm a little sad."
2.0,Super small and short.
2.0,I can honestly say this looks very cheap made! Was not impressed with it at all! Do not recommend
2.0,"It is ok for the price. Super thin, kind of tight and does not really look like a picture"
2.0,This dress is so thin and doesnt sit well on my body. It was too big I am 140 and 5'7 and curvy and i looked like a box...not a fan
2.0,"I like this dress very much up until I tried washing it. For the love of god, don't wash this dress. Although the tag says hand wash in cold water I assure you it will never be the same again. The collar and cuffs immediately wrinkled and shrank and the print became immediately faded and fuzzy because the white fabric the plaid is printed onto began to show through. I wouldn't have bought this dress if I knew it was dry clean only.<br /><br />Before this though I got two good wears out of it. It fit as expected and I ordered in my usual size."
2.0,"Cheaply made,but cute. I expected little bit bigger owl pendant and little bit longer chain. Very flashy...you got what you paid for.I will return this item...even it's only $6 I can't get over how cheap looking this is. It's just not for me."
2.0,This shirt had a weird fit in the sleeves and across the chest. Definitely not meant for busty girls
2.0,"Poor quality, ungainly design."
2.0,Would not order again. It was disappointing to see my daughter tell me that they didn't her braclet.
2.0,"Flimsy construction, however looks good."
2.0,"The fabric smells, it has static and it fits really small.  I purchased and XL and it fits like a Medium. I do not recommend to purchase this product.  I returned this blouse and had to pay for the postage return."
2.0,Not worth the money I paid for it .
2.0,The quality is good but it shrunk after first wash. The size almost reduced 2 times and now it dont fit me :(
2.0,"This shirt has a cute design, but the tank has a really weird shape. The shoulders are really tall. I don't know if it was because I ordered an XL and the shirt was made for some XT. I wouldn't recommend this shirt if you aren't very tall."
2.0,"The dress portion/top is more like a tunic. For nice and color was as pictured. The cheetah pants material is more like a wet dry material, the cheeta print is not cute, more like a Halloween costume print. The quality of the pants were terrible hem stitching was bad and pants fit awkwardly not like a jegging."
2.0,Watch is hard to adjust and put on. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Love the look but it detaches
2.0,they were giant! I did not expect them so large. I gave them away.
2.0,"Clothes were cheaply made. Seams aren't symmetrical and fabric is on the thin side. They are comfy and fit as expected, but they aren't the highest quality."
2.0,In less than 1 month the lining at the heel is already coming out.  I've had several Dearfoams before and this did not happen.
2.0,Color is not accurate as shown and material is not as I expected.  It wrinkles and is shapeless.
2.0,This item is not one size fits all.
2.0,"I bought these for my son, they are slightly smaller and of less quality than those I have ordered from Hanes in the past.  I was disappointed in the quality and fit, keeping them as back up boxers rather than go through the hassle of sending them back."
2.0,Pretty and soft but had numerous &#34;runs&#34; in the pattern.
2.0,"Material is stiff,not soft at all. Received mine with black marks on the bodice. Fit ok. Returning."
2.0,Not happy at all.  Looks nothing like the picture...
2.0,These might as well be briefs.
2.0,Looks like it’s probably a cute dress but I can’t try it on to see if it fits because it’s literally unfinished. I’m used to the clothing I purchase to come complete and ready to wear but this dress is literally not connected from the front to the back. Somehow I have to figure out how to thread the strings through the entire back of the dress in order to wear it. Not sure why I should have to construct my own clothing after I paid for a completed garment. Stupidest thing ever.
2.0,Was ok. Just too short for my liking
2.0,"I like the Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda shorts, but the Seafoam shorts that I received are much smaller than the others that I have in the same size. This pair is a size or maybe even two sizes too small. It is disappointing not to be able to trust that the sizes of the same brand and style shorts will be reliable and the same."
2.0,It's not a jacket it's more like a crop kimono. Very thin material and ran very small
2.0,"When I opened the package and saw the colors, the snap on the bag and the front pocket, I thought to myself I had made a good deal. But then I opened one of the bags and looked in. To my dismay I could see through the bag.  It reminded me of a piece of gauze. The listing for this item showed a picture of the bag filled with household cleaning items. No way these bags are going to hold something like that. I don't think I would trust them further than loaves of bread or boxes of crackers. Definitely nothing of any weight. If your carrying needs are minimal (sewing, crocheting, needlepoint) then these will be adequate for your needs.<br /><br />I only received 5 bags and not 10. Also note, the price has gone up from $10 to $16 for 10 bags. You should also be aware that there are 3 different offerings by this seller in this listing. &#34;Shopper&#34; tote bags (which is what I bought), &#34;Grocery&#34; bags and &#34;Mini&#34; bags. I do not know if the &#34;Grocery&#34; tote bags are thicker (which I doubt) but you should be aware of the possible confusion. Some reviews are for the &#34;Grocery&#34; bags and some are for the &#34;Shopper&#34; bags. My review is for the &#34;Shopper&#34; bag. Even at the low price I paid for them, $10, I would not recommend these to others. At the 60% increased price of $16 I would highly recommend others look elsewhere for their tote bag needs."
2.0,"This was one of the more disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon. I was looking for ways to update my fall wardrobe and thought this would be a perfect top to do that. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! First off, it's not the fabric or cut pictured at all! In the picture it looks flowy and drapey, but what arrived is not what is shown- it's stiff. Next, I ordered a XXL as I normally wear a 16/18. According to the sizing, that should fit. Not exactly. It barely fit, in fact it was super snug and I had to keep pulling it down while at work all day. It makes for a self conscience outfit. I had a white tank on under the shirt as it does not come with one, like the picture shows....again, kind of misleading. The color block trend is really in right now and I had on a new super blingy necklace with some winter white slacks, so I did get compliments when I wore it. I still think it wasn't worth the money. I would have returned it but I wore it and washed it already. I hope you save your money and find another top to purchase."
2.0,Runs small pockets are weird
2.0,"It's easy too use, but I've tried multiple times to get my picture and plastic to stick over the pin but it doesn't. I've read the instructions and followed them step by step every time so I know its not me doing something wrong. I'll keep trying and hope eventually one of them will work."
2.0,The bottom separated after a week of wear. Only worn to work for a desk job.
2.0,I returned it because even though it is nice looking but very cheaply made
2.0,"The fabric looks like the gymshark design but it feels nothing like it. They are way too stretchy and loose, not tight and form fitting."
2.0,The frames are beautiful and seem sturdy. The only problem is the transition is not a smooth transition. The areas to view (that are not the reader portion) are hard to focus and find the “right” looking glass. I’ve had transitional lenses twice before from optometrist office and these are not comparable to those. Good for reading only.
2.0,When I opened the package the necklace was damaged.
2.0,"I was excited to find these pants on Amazon, as I've seen them on another site but it takes a long time for that company to ship. I was dismayed when my package arrived because the detail on the front leg/thigh portion of the pants is damaged, and they cannot be repaired. Also, they are extremely tight. I ordered a medium, and I usually wear a small, and these were VERY tight around the stomach. Very uncomfortable."
2.0,"This wrap is so chintzy in length and width it's not worth it. The pockets are useless because the ends of the shawl only reach the elbow area. I'm a size 12, five feet six. Very cheaply made. I made it into a dog pillow."
2.0,One of the snap on pouches ripped the first time I took it out of town.
2.0,"The first 2 pairs I tried on were not completely sewn together,  about a 1"" hole on the left side at the elastic line.very"
2.0,"Need to return. Color is different from displayed.<br />I ordered the black one, and from the displayed pictures, the black is solid black. But the actual product is a thin transparent back layer+a thick nude layer. So the overall result is nude black, which is so ugly, and make your legs look fatter than before.<br />Also this product is so heavy and thick that I can only imagine to wear it in a heavy snow winter."
2.0,"It does smell like plastic very well, there are slits in the center corner of each eye that I guess you use to see out of, and it does NOT fit well and is extremely hard to see out of. Honestly not worth the money but my daughter plays with it a lot. She just complains she can't see out of it...a lot.."
2.0,Couldn't tell how big or small they was . And was too small for my taste.
2.0,I thought the tie looked great until the 2nd time I wore it. The back ripped so it won't hold the backside of the tie in place
2.0,"when these earnings first arrived I was very pleased with the over all appearance, but after only about two days  they broke."
2.0,Really awkward if you have breast larger than a C. The tie goes across your breast instead of waist. It just looks like it is wrong. Nice color though.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this keychain but its flaws have definitely outweighed its pros. For $10, you get a decent keychain, but the main reason for purchasing this was the Iron Man accessories. The face one arrived with scratches and some sort of black stain that I could not remove. The worst part is how noisy it is because it has an open back so its very light and makes quite a loud sound. I wear my keychain on my belt strap and normally am fine with the sounds my 2 keys make, but the sound this makes is very irritating. The body style one was better and definitely has a more solid feel. It does not make much noise so that is the one i'll be using from now on. I'd recommend paying a bit more for a better quality one elsewhere."
2.0,"I love this ring set! It’s so beautiful. Unfortunately, sizing is off and the stones come loose easily. Before ordering, I got my finger measured at a size 8 at multiple jewelry stores, so that’s what I ordered. When I tried on these rings, they were too large. They fit my friend who is a size 9 perfectly. Because I like the rings so much, I decided to keep them and buy some ring spacers. This morning, I discovered one of the opals to be missing. It is only the third day of wearing these rings and I haven’t done anything strenuous that would be reason for one of the stones to fall out. Looking at the reviews, it seems that this has happened to a previous buyer on the second day of her wearing them. All and all, the set is beautiful and the price is good, however I would caution those about to order about  sizing and if you happen to work with your hands a lot."
2.0,"and it isn't even a very labradorescent stone. I'm pretty disappointed. In addition to the one stone that is by the tied-off area (and the ties are STICKING OUT), there are 2 other interesting stones that are gold. Other than those complaints, well done if you want an all day greyish to whitish grey bracelet.<br /><br />Addendum: ordered a replacement as I found that many of the original bracelet stones were chipped badly, the replacement is almost white, platinum. And, again the best looking stone is by the tied off clasp which is sticking out. Going to look for another labradorite seller from here on out. Not like the pictures at all. The original, damaged bracelet looks better than this."
2.0,"The good about these gloves is that the touch pad on off button works great. The battery life I have been getting running with the warmest setting in Orange is about 2 hours per bar of battery life.<br />The bad is the glove is made for very short fingers and thumb. I bought the X-Large size it fits my hand good but the fingers are not long enough and the thumb is placed to high in the glove making it very uncomfortable to wear.<br />The heat seems concentrated more toward the palm and not at the fingers and thumb where I wanted more warmth.<br />Overall these gloves would be good for a walk in the cold, some activity where you could just let your have relaxed and be grabbing anything."
2.0,The pink was a very bright salmon color. Didn’t look like the pic very well at all. But the fit was good.
2.0,Very small fit and short
2.0,"The main tag is solid, but two of the aluminum cords broke after the first leg of my flight, including on the carry on. The crimping technique used is simply not strong enough to withstand even the slightest force."
2.0,I should of got a big size it fits good in my upper but is a half jacket
2.0,I just recently had a baby and have been looking for some gooey tips but I felt like this one fit funny and had to much material at the bottom.
2.0,"The earrings are fine except that they are MUCH darker than they appear in the picture (almost black, really). I can't use them for the dress I wanted to wear them with."
2.0,"It wasn't a pair, and the single one broke at the. Clasp the first time I put it on. Cute to look at but poor quality"
2.0,I thought the keychain would feel less cheap
2.0,The shirt is very nice and the color blue matched the picture.  The size chart is WAY OFF!  I have a 43 chest so I ordered the XL.  The shirt measures 27 1/2&#34; across that's 55&#34; around. I will be returning it for a L. Got to go 2 stars because of the size chart.
2.0,Disappointed with color of gem stones.
2.0,"The watch is as pictured, but the face is smaller. Also, the pink music notes are super glittery so it looks kiddish. The gold trim looks cheap."
2.0,Pajama top came undone at the seams. Not recommended
2.0,"I was going to send these back but decided to give them a try. Should have sent them back. I was concerned about how thin they were, and besides being very small for a 10-13 sock, they lacked re-inforcement, especially in the heel area. I usually get 6 months out of a Gold Toes, cotton 5-pack. I'm getting wear-through ""heel"" holes after 6 weeks with these. You could feel the ""thinness"" on the bottoms from the get-go, especially on hardwood-type floors. Good price with poor quality. Live and learn. Nothing here folks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Pix is after seven weeks."
2.0,"This is too floppy to stay up over my eyes. It just was not as expected, which is unfortunate because it looks adorable in this picture."
2.0,"They are pretty, but not well made at all. I can wear cheap shoes typically, but the heel placement on these feel very wobbly. Not worth breaking an ankle in."
2.0,"LOVED the fit and feel of this shirt.  However, it had a tear in the seam when it arrived and is Already unthreading even though I just got it out of the package less than 2 hours ago. :("
2.0,I WAs ok but too small but I will give to a young lady for a prom dress  thanks
2.0,It was way too small. I've bought similar products in this size that fit
2.0,I received the wrong panties. They were supposed to be boy shorts but I received high waisted ugly panties. I was disappointed 😞
2.0,"I returned this item the very next day. Except for the color, the outfit is NOTHING like the picture on the model. The sleeves and top are different. The model’s outfit looks like it’s billowy around the waist area but wasn’t on the actual jumpsuit received. The tied waist you tie up yourself and there aren’t any loops and the material definitely was too short. The bow looked horrible.<br />I’m giving two stars only b/c they allow for returns and credited me back right away otherwise it would be a 1 star rating."
2.0,I dislike these insoles because they are to heavy and too thick for my shoes. Not enough room for my feet in my shoes.
2.0,"My husband wanted a new pair of house slippers so I bought these for him based on the price and that they looked comfy.  They arrived in a bag inside a box and I did not take them out of the bag before giving them to him.  When he opened the bag, the stitching was already coming apart and there was a one-inch hole in the seam.  I wanted to send them back immediately but he said he didn't care because they were so comfortable.  He wears them everyday.  I don't expect them to last long, but for the price I will probably just order him another pair once these are worn down since he seems to like them so much."
2.0,Literally a sweater made of a Brillo pad
2.0,"I wear a size 7 5/8 so, I have a larger hat size. Having said that, those of us with larger hat sizes should steer clear of this product. It has an adjustable band on the back with I had to use the very last peg to get it to fit comfortably on my big ole head. That looks pretty funny, so I just decided to hang the hat on my wall since the design looks kind of cool. Just another note, it is a very over-sized logo. So, get it for your kids or grandkids to celebrate your service. By the way, Airborne ALL THE WAY!"
2.0,"Honestly, I thought this dress would be black, but ended up with a floral print.  The wrap style on me was ill-fitting, and the material felt cheap.  I would return it if I'd paid money for it."
2.0,This dress is  very big and boxy for me.  I love the color but it wasn't flattering at all.  May be it fits better for small petite ladies.
2.0,"I like them but they are not very sturdy, so much so they were also a little flattened during shipping."
2.0,"Item looked good on the watch. However, product broke within 30 days of being on the watch. So be cautious if you buy one, the stability on this band will not hold up for long. I ended up buying the black one for 5 dollars because if I get 30 days or more then I may feel better about only spending 5 dollars other than 20."
2.0,"Very disappointing, spent over an hour trying to fit my smaller size series 6 Apple Watch into it it would not work. I even use pliers. I wish I never bought it because I was so excited for it it was the biggest letdown this year"
2.0,Ordered a XL still very small.  Cute pattern. Thin material.
2.0,"Smell terrible, cheap materials."
2.0,Lo enviaron en talla más pequeña y la tela es Licra
2.0,"Love this dress, but it was too loose on top and too tight in the waist.  I am 5'4"" and 180 pounds.  I ordered a 2XL based on other reviews.  Not something I would buy again."
2.0,The fabric felt like bathing suit material. Odd. It was returned.
2.0,"There is a pulled thread through the center of the tie. Also, it was sent to me rolled up in a plastic bag. Considering the cost of the tie, that is unacceptable"
2.0,"Cute, but took way to long receiving it."
2.0,"Hat and gloves ran small, too tight for my 12 year-old daughter."
2.0,"Tight fit. Arm pit to arm pit. Returned, Amazon made returning super easy. No return shipping fee."
2.0,There was a reviewer who rocked it with heels she looked so pretty but this dress fit wayyyyyy too large witch can be better than it not fitting at all hahahaha! Most likely returning for a smaller size! Fast shipping!! (PRIME)
2.0,It is falling apart after a couple months! I wouldn’t recommend buying it!
2.0,It's cute but it differently looks cheap and the pendant doesn't fit properly on the chain... not really worth getting... but if you're using it just for costume jewelry then I say go for it...
2.0,Reflection of lights behind me is distracting
2.0,"it said it was stainless steel but the clips are irritating my ears.  This is not stainless steel because I have stainless steel products that do not bother my skin but this one does.  So, be aware of this false marketing."
2.0,Good to look at but not skin friendly
2.0,Not anywhere near as pretty up close. I ended up donating it to a good cause
2.0,The leather necklace is very cheap and twisted.  The small pendant is cute but too small.
2.0,"Strap and broke. My strap broke, not at the leather or pleather part but straight up the “metal” clasp. I’m hella bummed. It’s an easy fix, the bag was only 15 some odd dollars but it’s still lame that it’s broken already. I’ve only had the bag for a week if that. Boo. The whole thing fell apart. Ya get what you pay for, definitely NOT daily driver kind of purse"
2.0,This skirt is bohemian chic which I why I got it but it is too long. What I mean is unless you’re over 5’0 tall you’re going to trip over this skirt unless you hold it up while walking which I did. You could wear heels or wedges but even then it’s too long. The free size is accurate and all but the material is too flimsy and can easily cause you to trip or for the material to rip. Honestly the material which I cannot tell you what it is exactly because there was no tag found inside. Now the positives are that is pretty and has an attached slip which is great.
2.0,"these might work for many people, they are certainly a cheap maui jim.  but they are not maui hims.  the one thing that on my face stood out the most is that the nose bridge was silver, for folks purchasing these, zoom in and look at that, it is quite prominent once they're on your face.  this will probably work for a lot of folks who don't want to spend $200 for maui jims, not me."
2.0,Shirt was cute but super small.  Ended up giving it away.  Bought largest size and I usually take a large in tops.
2.0,Returned because of a cheap looking fabric and application.
2.0,These do not have any grip at all and they are too loose fitting
2.0,"I gave it to my husband to use after the shower. It looks nice, but does not absorb any water. I washed several times, hoping to make it more absorbent, and nevertheless it has not lost its waterproof quality. Cannot be used as a bathrobe, which is what it is sold as."
2.0,"I previously wrote a review based just off first impression, which was perfect.  This dress is lovely and my daughter is obsessed with it, looks just like the picture.  But the yoke started separating from the skirt before she finished the first wear and the smocking is coming undone after a single wash.  Very cute but poor quality."
2.0,Beautiful but not what I expected
2.0,Durability is not there
2.0,These are VERY narrow. They are child size however that it not listed anywhere in the product description. It is funny how tiny these are. An adult cannot wear them.
2.0,Straps fell off on both sides. Very disappointed. I have only had this purse for a little over 1 month
2.0,"Cheap price, cheap product"
2.0,I was looking for something stretchy and solid- a compression tank.  This is not it.
2.0,"I really loved the design!  I’m a huge Triskele admirer, and was immediately drawn to this keychain.  I’ve had it for three days, and unfortunately I dropped my key.  Evidently it’s nowhere near as durable as it is beautiful.  It broken in half.  For the price, I would have thought it should be much stronger than that!  I’m disappointed.  I thought about buying another, but figured in all likelihood I would drop my keys again...😢"
2.0,Too large and too gross<br />Its appear to be for men
2.0,The clothes are super cheap and they sell very expensive
2.0,So thin it doesn't want to stay put. Face opening is very small and will not accommodate a larger head. The Friendly Swede balaclava is a much better purchase.
2.0,Not for tall people...received this jumpsuit and was at first excited since the print looked very nice. However I put it on and this REALLY is not ment for tall people. The bottom ended just below my knee...super awkward. Had to return..<br />For reference I am 5’9
2.0,Helped me decide if I really want to get my nose pierced but tyne gold color faded quick
2.0,This necklace looks much cheaper in person. I do not like the way it hangs.
2.0,I love the glasses but the frame was broken on the left inner eye  They want me to return them but I don’t live anywhere close to a UPS store
2.0,"The pendant itself was much too tiny and the stones in it didn’t sparkle. The chain was beautiful, but it just didn’t work for me."
2.0,"Need a size larger, ordered based on sizing chart and bottom is too tight and feels like I'm cutting into my neck tying the straps to hold to suit up on my chest in the right place"
2.0,"I liked the fabric a lot, and the pockets and the full style.  The problem was that the pants were very short.  In the picture they come to the ankle.  I am 5'2&#34; so I did not expect them to be 5-6&#34; above the ankle.  So they are very wide pants but up so high that they looked very strange.  I'm good at alterations, but you can't make things longer than they are."
2.0,This sweater is very pretty in person but very heavy and very thick. It’s not at all as pictured on the model.
2.0,The material isn't as stretchy as I expected.
2.0,It's way to small for $16 better off with the $20 one
2.0,Cheesy plastic watch and cheap chain. Over-priced child's toy instead of nice time piece.
2.0,"the write up does not say these are wide calf boots.  the length is fine but the calf just flops a round,  too bad, they were nice boots but sent them back"
2.0,"the belt does the job, but not as thick as original military weeb belts; the newer &#34;fatigue&#34; belt buckle works better and is simpler to use.  It seems that you need to persuade these older style &#34;dress&#34; buckles to work."
2.0,"I ordered an XL as it says oversized and it was not at all oversized. I am 5'11 and the sleeves barely reach my wrist and the armpit area is very snug. Makes me sad, the sweater texture is amazing though. Just size up a couple if buying."
2.0,Good lenses just a little to small for the frames.<br />They don't fill the frame all the way so it lets light through and the frames aren't as tight on my head
2.0,I got this for a Christmas present for my daughter who loves h2o and I was very disappointed. If you look at the pictures you can tell how cheep the stone is and how one side has been painted out so light can't pass threw it. I just expected a little more for official licensed merchandise.  I feel like if I would have grabbed a blue stone and wrapped it in a leather cord I could have made something better looking and I have zero jewelry making skills.
2.0,"TINY. This is straight up Asian sizing - a size XL in this might work for a tween girl. I got a large, and I can put it, but is hilariously skin-tight over my A-cup chest...you would probably need to have under a 29-inch bust to make it look anything like the photo. That said, it's a decent cottony-mix fabric, and better constructed than I would've expected. But seriously: do not attempt this as an adult woman unless you are of bird-like build, have an exceedingly narrow ribcage, and no boobs whatsoever."
2.0,The earrings themselves are really cute but really uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter, this is her review... 1 of the eye stones on 1 of the rings fell out within minutes of wear. A day later another eye fell off of a different ring!<br />Overall I like these rings, they are cute and mostly adjustable if you need that."
2.0,"The belt is good quality, but my jeans' waistband was too big, so the belt was on my skin with the waist band below. I actually forgot what I was doing when ordering.....I intended to order the 2 loop version, which I think would work better for me."
2.0,"A few years ago these was the best shoes for me at work, walking but when I order these as soon as I put them on they was not the same shoes and is not worth the price.  I had ordered two pair but sent the one pair back.  They knew that they had problem with the toe part but they took away the support ."
2.0,The mask itself is cute but considering this is a child’s show assumed it would be a child’s mask but it is huge. Even big for her mommy- she as so disappointed.
2.0,the style is just too billowy and large. Looks more like a moo moo (mu mu?). I didn't like it.
2.0,Good quality a tad feminine
2.0,These were VERY sm for being lg size
2.0,My son picked out this watch because it looked so cool in the picture. When it arrived it turns out it's kind of cheesy and not nearly as cool as looks in the picture.
2.0,Ripped om first use. Went in the garbage
2.0,Hat came with folds and would not even out.
2.0,"looks round, but in fact they are flat on the back, pretty heavy, and are darker then shown on picture. wouldn't buy again."
2.0,"I am 13 and this was WAY too big for me. plus, on the red, instead of black writing, it was in orange. so it looked kinda dumb. only buy this if youre a parent. it will not fit kids."
2.0,If you have a lot of hair this is not the cap for you! the depth is short. I order the XL and it was still to small.
2.0,The piece that holds the strap broke the first time I wore it... I sent it back! However its a cute purse.
2.0,"They’re bigger than I thought they’d be. Also, I order a 4 pack and only received two of them."
2.0,Cheaply made. Waste of money
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:fae160835abad40afea1d284c276a9c2]] If you're looking for lots of balls, lip studs, or horse shoe rings it's alright.... However the description says it has other things in it like tongue rings, none of them are even remotely close to that.<br />Most the balls are cheap plastic balls, that's it."
2.0,The soles are a different color green . In the advertising pic it shows them as the whole show being one color
2.0,"These earrings were real big, I did not like them they were to big for me.  My niece loved them"
2.0,The ears are just floppy stupid fabric pieces... I tore them off and knitted my own pair of cat ears that I sewed on :) made a super cute and easy Halloween custome
2.0,Very disappointed.  I purchased these earrings in December and three months later the wire that goes through your earlobe broke.  It's too late to return - I'm going to contact the seller and see if there is a remedy to this situtation.
2.0,This is just a basic crew sweatshirt with 2 different colors - not nearly as stylish as it looks in the pictures
2.0,"The description is misleading. Though there are different color choices, the lower price means they are not individually wrapped. I was very disappointed. Contacted seller, who offered me a 25% refund to return them since I used a mask from the box. Dissatisfied, and disappointed in this purchase."
2.0,Super cute and great material. I wore it for an hour before one of the cross cross straps fell off. Disappointed
2.0,Product claims to be suited for freezing temps and is far from that wouldn't wear this product in anything less than 40 degree weather.
2.0,The hat has been sitting around for about a week waiting for it to properly unfold and the creases don’t come out. Also it looks better in the picture
2.0,The item was about 2-3 sizes too small.
2.0,"These are very sheer.  Which I suppose is ok if you want an undershirt.  Although why people think little girls need undershirts is beyond me, unless it's for warmth in the wintertime.  I wanted these to use as tank tops in hot weather.  Just plain, simple, shirts for play.  They are way to sheer for that purpose.  Might as just have her run around in the yard in her diaper if the weather is warm.<br /> Otherwise, they are nicely cut, they look like they are a good length (will actually cover the tummy, unlike some other tops)."
2.0,There are additional items needed to apply this nose.  I threw it away.
2.0,To rough and smaller than normal and less quality than expected
2.0,TO BIG OF LENSES!!
2.0,because the small size is still big. :( i love the style but i still cant wear it.
2.0,This is much smaller than the picture leads you to believe it is. This is practically useless.
2.0,The material is scratchy and doesn't breathe.
2.0,"The fit was slightly different than i expected. I wanted it to be more flowy, but it was just a thick tank... not much else to say about it"
2.0,"Really cute, but the screws are coming out already. My girl is 2 and wanted green glasses, but she pulled & played with the hinges too much so, really not as much give as there should be. I might just get some used professional glasses @ the thrift shop & pop the lenses out."
2.0,"First I was very skeptical to order it since the size says: 13-14 years....I've never seen a size going by years.  The pants seem way too long for the person I was giving this to.  Also, it bothered me that it said that this was not fire resistant...plus it does have a smell to it, but most clothes do it seems, when ordering online.  I may end up sending it back.  It is cute though."
2.0,"I added a picture of the front and back to show they don’t always come with the little circle logo on the back - I was a little disappointed with the fit and the missing logo made me feel like they just sent me a “mess up” type of pair. They fit tighter than I thought, definitely not lulu align dupes, I would say they are more like buff bunny dupes."
2.0,"The ring is very strong, but i get it less then a week ago and the dark writing already gone.  It is hard  to read if the dark coloring is not there, i love the ring just cant really see what it says clearly"
2.0,Doesn’t look real
2.0,"The bands dont come with the easy pins that are on the picture. Also no tools are provided for the installation of the regular pins. I already own a few so that wasn't a big deal. Hiwever, the advertisement is misleading."
2.0,"I really did love the design of these, the shape is really cool. But they didn't last 2 months and wore them 1-2 times a week. First the lenses fell out of the frame, then just last week, I grabbed them out of my purse and the side broke off. I finally just threw them away."
2.0,very pretty but bends very easily and is starting to crack already
2.0,"These were very cheaply made, the legs are not even, and they have a horrible smell of vinegar.  They've been relegated to the ""never leaving home in these pants"" pile."
2.0,"I originally rated 5 stars, but the strap just came off after a month and a half, 2 weeks after my return date closed. Very frustrating."
2.0,Really baggy in the buttock but tight in the thighs
2.0,This runs so tight I couldn't get it on. There's no stretch. I ordered a Large and its still to small. Had to return. I picked out something else.
2.0,"These pants look fine but stretch out while being worn and do not return to the original size. Donating them, will not buy again."
2.0,"Complicated, it's suppose to be self winding & automatic, in spite of the time, date adjustment. It only moved for a few seconds. You can hardly read the text ob the manual."
2.0,Not flattering for an apple shape. Tried a size up and couldn't see any discernable difference.
2.0,"This dress is made of super-cheap Chinese t-shirt fabric. It sort of works but I can't figure out why they charge so much for something that looks and feels like it costs 25 cents a yard.  Like, comes out of the package damp. The color is way more yellow than the picture too. I bought it because I wanted a nice dress- it stretches and fits well but is mostly gross."
2.0,"No inside pockets like last aconcogua I purchased 2 years ago.No pleats on bottom of vest like last one I purchased.<br />Much cheaper,I am very disappointed.<br />North Face has really cheapened product."
2.0,Cute but it broke and I'm 7 days past my 30 days and can't exchange it for one that lasts more than 5 weeks.
2.0,"Really loose, so it falls down all the time. Material is ok, but it is not windproof."
2.0,"The idea was a great one, but the color missed the mark and it runs 2 or 3 sizes small.  It doesn't hang like it shows on the model.  The fabric is thick.  I really wanted to love this, but...just can't."
2.0,Why do I even bother with this Chinese &#34;Aisian fit&#34; garbage? Answer: I will never do it again.<br /><br />The fit is garbage and so is the material.
2.0,Well I had hoped for a super sexy party dress. Well it is a party dress but for the wrong kind of party if you get what I mean.
2.0,Cute little slides for my lik dude. I bought a size smaller due to the other reviews. They fit okay. Not much room to grow. But the elastic strap on one shoe is sewn wrong. It is twisted and doesn't lay flat against his foot.
2.0,"Beautiful style, however, it turned my skin green the day I put it on. I kept wearing it, nonetheless, and it's now a steel color. NOT sterling silver, wish I wouldn't have paid what I did for it."
2.0,"I wasn't expecting anything of high-quality with the price of these, but these were a big disappointment. The clasps barely bend and one of the earrings arrived with the clasp already broken off. Sorry, can't recommend these."
2.0,The end sticks out past the buckle making it not so neat looking.
2.0,"Its way smaller than you think, I have an average size head and it doesn't stay on."
2.0,Too small. iPhone 6+ does not fit
2.0,"The top cups are spaced abnormally far apart. The bottom is pretty cute with the ruching and quite flattering.  It does come all the way up to under my breasts, though. It cld potentially be worn as a one piece if the top wasn't so oddly constructed. I'm returning it."
2.0,"Super cute look, but the leather was so stiff. In addition the way the sole is made I slid around just walking on carpet in my home. Unfortunately returned."
2.0,"too short on the body, creeps up easily."
2.0,Does not get the job done. Maybe I've mistaken this for a cleaner that would do well on silver; it does not. Works okay on platinum and white gold.
2.0,I had to send it back. The front was cut so low that it was impossible to wear.
2.0,Missed the window to return this… had I known that I would need to lace it myself I would have reconsidered purchasing. Lacing provided is too thick and difficult to lace the bodice….
2.0,"They are not stretchy at all but, still fit and look good. The black one fit better than the blue (blue was smaller but also a size medium) I only got these to wear under my other shirts so they work for me. I would not buy again though."
2.0,They kept breaking really easy. I was able to put them back together but have to keep searching for the heart charm when they'd fall off....
2.0,Supportive and fits how I would like but cut too narrow. Way too much side boob
2.0,"Can you Please indicate for future reference in the Description whether these jerseys are European cut or Standard sizing.<br /><br />I ordered and received a (2x) which I always do , But I can even get my arms in this thing.<br /><br />I'm 6' 6&#34; 235 and ( 2 X) should fit. A European Size chart should accompany the descriptions.<br />I hate returning anything , but I have no choice ."
2.0,"Material too thin and flimsy. Also, awkward fit."
2.0,Tight fit.. and it's hard to find a shirt to go with it.. the actual skirt is kinda a salmon pink color.
2.0,"Not form fitting at all like the picture.  I like the concept, but I like this type of shirt to be a little more fitting.  Mask area is a good idea also, but is snug.  And why zippers???  Who in design thought, ""you folks know what this product needs. . .zippers"".  And the buddy across the table thought, ""but what if, and bare with me, WHAT IF. . .it had TWO zippers?!""."
2.0,The material is a bit thin and the color is more of a faded olive rather than the vibrant olive pictured.
2.0,Great quality lenses but cut to small and does not fit properly.
2.0,The dress is pretty and material is good but it was too big on me. Ordered size small and theres no more smaller size on this brand.
2.0,It's very cheaply made. Thin polyester and sizing is small. Good thing babies grow out of clothes fast because this one won't last. Definitely not recommended.
2.0,"You can cut Spam in the shape of a sirloin and serve it with hollandaise and some roasted vegetables, along with a classy wine. But it's still Spam. That's what this shirt is. A less-than-quality t-shirt with flappy tendrils connected to the waist to fashion a would-be stylish belt. You'll look cheap, just like I did. I had a good laugh at the attempt, though, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars."
2.0,I have received the shirt 2 times and both times it was the wrong size.  The shirt appears to be nice.
2.0,"Although they are soft and do warm your feet,  they say in the title that they are rechargeable... not.  Nor is there a way to control the amount of heat.  It's either plugged in and on or is unplugged and off. The heating element is small about 3"" x 6"" but effective when plugged in.  Also don't plan on having them plugged in if you plan on walking around the house,  the Cord is simply aren't long enough to take a stride.  If i had to do it again I would find something that truly is rechargeable... Meaning having a battery and way to control the heat."
2.0,"I will change my rating once I feel satisfied it's a REAL MK Navy purse. I own several Desighner purses and wallets. They all look and feel &#34;high quality&#34;.  I've had cheap stuff and there is a big difference. Does anyone share my concern?  The outer fabric dn feel like leather, maybe pleather.  The inside liner doesn't look or feel high quality. I compared it Side by side with my MK From Dept. Store. BIG differences.  Did not come with usual dust bag, zipper not marked or MK tags giving authentication attached."
2.0,The ties are self done
2.0,Within 3 days the white of the flower started coming off and for me that was the point. I have it two stars because it didnt change color
2.0,Ordered x-large but these are so tight they are uncomfortable.  Had to order some others can't wear these.
2.0,Very cute but it's pink not purple<br /><br />*UPDATE* seam was split before first wear.  Super disappointing.
2.0,"Work really well for first use, long-run quality just isn’t there. These were not holding up well before I put them in the dryer, but drying them totally ruined the elasticity. Low price for compression socks, but certainly do not place in dryer."
2.0,"Not a Heavy T-shirt, to lIght, Not a good quality T-shirt"
2.0,"I know this is an ""oversized"" sweatshirt, but I ordered the smallest size (S), and I'm swimming in it.  It is like a dress, really.  it is a shame, because it looks like a reasonably well made hoodie, and I do like a baggie style, but, there just is no way I can actually wear this :(. It also arrived vacuumed sealed and incredibly wrinkled as a result."
2.0,"I loved the color and fit of this band for my new Versa 3 and wore it comfortably for over a month before the part joining the band to the watch broke. After that, the watch didn't fit correctly for good readings. The pink band that came with the watch irritates my skin. I've ordered a third band and hope that one will be okay."
2.0,While the bag is cute it is much cheaper on other sites
2.0,Love the look but they just don't fit me like I would like.  That said I where a 3X and the XL was the biggest they had.
2.0,"The blue color is not as Smokey as the photo and they are a bit heavy. The backs are bendable/they came that way. I don’t think the post will last very long/easily break off. They are Meh. You get what u pay for,"
2.0,The sequins fall off every time you moved. Plus it was very itchy.
2.0,TOO SMALL FOR ADULT.
2.0,This is partly my fault for not thinking ahead but this magnetic grip is SO USELESS. It always loosens when it gets caught on a sleeve and has no way to stay secured to the wrist other than the magnet. It’s cool looking but essentially useless. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON’T BUY THIS.
2.0,"It was WAY smaller than what the measurements said... I measured my waist, and decided to order one size down so that it would be snug... but the product didnt even fit my friend who is a US size small (I ordered a large). Trying to return it but accidentally threw out the shipping box so I'm in the process of getting a used amazon box to send it back in from the recycle."
2.0,"My grand daughter only wore this as pajamas, but I've had to mend the seams at least 5 times. Now the hood needs mended.  Guess we got the ""lemon"" . I cannot recommend this item."
2.0,The socks fit is somewhat flimsy and slides around the foot.
2.0,"I bought this a while ago as a gift for my girlfriend because she has so much nail polish. I thought this would be a good way for her to keep it all organized, or at least all in one place. And it was okay when I got it, a bit too small but that's on me since it does have the size in the description. Also some of the compartments on the inside are a bit small, but she made it work. The problem I had with it though is that it fell apart within a week or two, like I figured it's basically made of . And it's not like she was taking it everywhere she went. She just moved it back and forth from the bedroom to the living room whenever she wanted to do her nails. So if you do buy it, just be careful and support it by more than just the handle or your stuff will be all over the floor."
2.0,"Even though I bought the XL size (I wear L or XL), I have thin fingers and the fingers are still too tight. I have long fingers and the fingers are still too long. It makes me wonder who these gloves are supposed to fit. Another annoying issue that I foresee is that the gloves are basically a 2-piece construction. This means that there is a liner within the outer shell and when you try to take the gloves off after sweating in them, despite how hard you try, the inner liner will pull out inside-out as you remove the gloves. I have been in construction in Denver for 39 years and have worn a lot of gloves. I will not use these gloves, but I bought another brand that fits great!!"
2.0,Shoes look great but unfortunately they did not fit my wide foot.
2.0,"I would have liked to give this 5 stars b/c it's very pretty.. But, for the price it cost, it's really flimsy and, worse, it's HUGE! Not the stones but the length!<br />Flimsy and huge is a terrible combination in a cuff style bracelet. It will never be able to take the stress of taking it on and off and.. I can only wear it if I tighten it and, even then, I can literally wrap the ends completely around my wrist.<br />No way this is a 7&#34; bracelet. I measured and it's almost 10&#34; from end to end.<br />Still debating if I should send it back or tighten it and leave it on 24/7."
2.0,Unimpressive.  I returned it.
2.0,"First I would like to mention that my items arrived quickly and intact. I love the length of the barbells. Not too tight, but there's no bar visible which really adds to the beauty of the jewelry. My disappointment comes with the color. I ordered the lavender colored balls. They are without a doubt sparkly, but are more of a dull, dark Violet color which is nothing like the photo shown. I ordered this color specifically because it looked vibrant and would add great contrast to my brown nipples. The color I received blends in and adds little &#34;pizazz&#34;. Greatly disappointed in the color which makes me disappointed with my purchase."
2.0,"With some of the colors like purple and blue, you can hardly see them in the dark. I expected better from this product."
2.0,Ordered an XS but it obviously runs larger in size. It looked like I was wearing a huge sack.  Can see the potential in the dress but designed for more  statuesque women.
2.0,"So, I know I am short, but these are way to long. Listen to other buyers in regards to the length.<br />The other point is that it’s not as thin as you would think.<br />All and all I would use them, but with some really slim pants."
2.0,"I purchased this tank because I liked the way the sports bra underneath peeked out above the tank at the neckline. But it doesn't actually look that way when you put it on. The sports bra sits well below the tank and only shows a little at the sides (see photo). Also, they should just sell the tank and sports bra as a set and not actually sew them together. It's like a brain teaser to try to line them up correctly and then slip them both on together. Why?"
2.0,Retorned
2.0,"The shoes are beautiful, but around the fringe is very BIG, it doesn't fit your legs."
2.0,These are microfiber stretch pants that show everything worn underneath and too revealing overall for me. They are NOT fleece type sweats.
2.0,"Fair quality, as expected. I was disappointed however that &#34;Love in Iceland&#34; was not printed on the product. The packaging was very generic. I purchased this for a friend who was getting married in Iceland and admit I did purchase this ONLY because I expected labeled packaging."
2.0,"It's nice and long but the fabric is not suitable for being cooking by the stove. It felt very hot and I was feeling the heat, almost thought it was going to catch fire... Gave me a heat rash. It should have been a cotton blend. I bought it because of the sunflower print that I like."
2.0,Made cheaply and doesn’t hang without curling. Do not buy unless you don’t care that it will not meet your expectations. I sent them back.
2.0,I love these earrings! They were super shiny and pretty and very comfortable to sleep in and wear day and night. Unfortunately I took them out one day to shower after about 5 days of continuous wear and the spot where the chain is welded to the Pin broke and now I can no longer wear them. Poor quality....
2.0,More like boxers than work-out shorts I would wear in public. Don't buy these just because they're cheap... spend a little more get a little better quality.
2.0,Shorts are smaller and fit too tight.
2.0,These gloves will not keep your hands warm down to -30. That’s a  ridiculous claim. Maybe 10 degrees if your lucky
2.0,"The jacket was nice looking. However, I ordered an XL and it fit as if it was a small/medium. Seriously! It must have been a Girls vs Misses. Im 5.4, 185 and I can wear an XL, but this thing here is ridiculous. I returned it so fast!"
2.0,Beautiful but fell apart after only wearing them once.
2.0,"I think it took longer for the pants to arrive, than it did for them to wear out in the thighs. The pockets were oddly shaped. And the pants were itchy. They looked nice on, but they are not worth the trouble."
2.0,"I love the way these pants fit, but I just wore them for the first time and they got all fuzzy, the fabric is pilling and there are some strings hanging."
2.0,"My little man is a bit rough on his toys, but this one only lasted for 5 days after Christmas before it broke in half."
2.0,The feel of this was great. The style was great. Unfortunately the size was all wrong. I got a size 16/18 and they definitely weren’t that large.
2.0,Not worth for the price spent
2.0,Seems to be made a few sizes smaller than indicated.  Waist is very short and everything it too tight to wear comfortably.
2.0,Not the color I ordered and doesn’t look like the picture at all
2.0,"This was advertised as a child’s mask, however it was clearly adult sized. It will not fit it’s intended wearer."
2.0,Not a great product.  Average at best
2.0,Material is okay. The size is what I am most upset about. It is like a Men's medium. I'm not sure if it was worth the $40 I paid for it because I gave it to my little brother. The size chart is misleading and inaccurate. The XL says 42&#34; waist so I ordered 2XL because I wanted to wear nice dress clothes underneath. I have a 40&#34; waist and the 2XL was WAY to small. I am throughly disappointed...
2.0,These belts are more narrow than the picture makes them look. I was disappointed.
2.0,"Nice fabric, although it clings too much. If you have long legs it's more like a shirt than a dress even in a large size."
2.0,The Snap on top is torn already...not durable I assume...I love under armour but my son shoe is already torn up
2.0,"The hem was undone at the neck and at the bottom upon arrival and the shirt didn't cover the bottom of my breasts. Very small even though I followed their sizing. The other shirt patterns I ordered were fine, but this was a different fabric so maybe that's why. My chest isn't even very large, so if you have anything larger than an A cup beware."
2.0,the sole is not slippery and the shoe has no last.
2.0,"Very disappointed,  I had to give this jumpsuit to my sister and even then she will have to alter the length."
2.0,"I love to watch band. However, the ends being too small causes the band to fall off the watch. If you days in a row. I have almost lost my watch due to the band falling completely off and me not noticing it until it was almost too late."
2.0,"Gorgeous color a vibrant bright orange romper.  it hits all the right places.  I am a curvy girl 5'7""  and 245 pounds.  It fit over leggings and its very flattering.  BUT the booty area is extremely tight and I would need some heavy duty spanks to pull this off.  I have never had a romper that didnt drag the floor so this was a pleasant surprise.  I would order another color but in a larger size.  I dont think it would be as flattering if I wasnt curvy."
2.0,"Really cute outfit made decently. I'm used to thus kind of sizing, and I ordered a 110 when my kid usually wears 80-90. This thing is tight on her! For reference, she's 2 and a half, weighs 25 lbs, and wears 18-24 months clothes. It's not really harem style either...more like a standard one piece. But the bunny is cute, so she can wear it for a little while.<br /><br />P.S. Sorry for the cheesy grin!"
2.0,"They are gigantic, much bigger than I expected."
2.0,"Too small for me, I don’t like the material, the fabric is too thin and cheap"
2.0,Not good at all. Gave them to someone else.
2.0,I ordered my usual size and lacked two inches closing at the waistline.  I decided to order a large today and they are no longer available.  Ug
2.0,Didn’t hang well. Way too much material.  Sent back.
2.0,Tarnished in 2 weeks
2.0,I bought this for my 18 year old son he never uses it. He couldn't figure what it was  it's very thin and easy to lose.
2.0,Don’t look like the picture
2.0,Not what I expected.<br />I ordered this hat bec of the initials J&A but got a different one instead
2.0,Looks cheap. Has a toxic smell. Foot pad is very thick
2.0,Both were broken within one week - just normal wear but when the beads hit against anything (one broke when it was hit against my leg and the other was broke when it hit against a desk)  I loved the look of them when they came but they needed to be made with more durable material.  Now we are completely without either one.  Disappointed.
2.0,"Not as expected, the material is not cotton."
2.0,Not worth the money at all. From the picture I thought it had elastic around the top to keep it up but it's just a very thin material all around. It didn't roll much at all but the fact that it does is disappointing. Other than that the fit is fine and true to size. I will throw it out and definitely don't recommend it to anyone.
2.0,"The product title says segmented rings, but as you can see from the picture, only like half of them are.  The others are just a metal soft enough to bend back and forth.  I bought this for the segmented ones.  But even those are really lackluster.  They are *tiny* which can be a good thing.  But the edges on almost all of them are sharp, and quite a few wobble front to back so it was nearly impossible to click it back together properly.  Out of the 16, three wound up being usable for me and the rest went in the garbage.  And those 3 are not ones I would reach for if I wanted to look nice.<br /> Lesson learned, I guess."
2.0,"Not real moldavite, wore it for a week the button of the stone started to miss the color.  Looks like glass."
2.0,"The material is so stiff it cut into my ankle, making these shoes too uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"After wearing these for only 4 months, these shoes are already tearing holes in the seams!  :(  Definitely not the most sturdy shoes... and for a toddler or young kid, they SHOULD be sturdy.  My son also complains that they don't have much traction (compared to his previous pairs which 'climbed up the slides and helped me run better').  I'm bummed that I have to buy new shoes for him AGAIN when he hasn't even outgrown these."
2.0,Lights stopped working on 1 shoe after wearing one time.
2.0,Quality is ok. The fit is a little snug. Waist band rolls down when working out.
2.0,"Took a chance on ordering this before it had any reviews, because I really wanted a coat that was midway between a regular hoodie and my big thick super warm dead-of-winter coat. The material of this coat is very rough, both the outside and the inside. The &#34;fleece&#34; lining is thin and not at all soft, the seams are uncomfortable (probably because of the cheap materials used), the sleeves are a bit short (like the sleeves were made normal length and then rolled up and sewn to make the cuffs), and it's too small where the arms meet the body, plus it's stiff. Disappointing."
2.0,These were inexpensive earrings and they are.
2.0,"Not as pictured. The grey in the shirt is darker, which makes the black words illegible against the very dark Grey. Will be returning. Disappointing because the shirt is nice otherwise"
2.0,Runs very very small..definitely order at least 2 sizes up!
2.0,"Ai really liked the suit, it was very attractive but the size was at least 2 sizes too small.  Made in China, I ordered an extra large but it was at best a small."
2.0,Product turned grey almost immediately. Don't think it has any silver.
2.0,Cheaply made and looks cheap.
2.0,"Very disappointed,  Im a 36 34 40, 5'4&#34; 145 lbs. I  usually wear a medium  but on amazon I usually have to by a large or xl, so i went with a large. This dress was so cute in the picture, but does not fit like picture depicts. I did like it but saw to many cons to keep it. First off it was not the type of material i hoped it would be, i wanted material with minimal stretch. Second, it was much longer than the picture depicted, I wanted one that fell above the knee and this one was 2 inches below the knee plus the cut for the hips was at my upper thigh making it look odd.Third, the bottom hemline was crooked, im a bit ocd and that would drive me up a wall. Forth, the size chart is very confusing, with the way they have it listed it seems like all sizes should fit. I was thinking about trying it in a smaller size but i would have to get a small to fit the length I want and im afraid that would be to tight around my waist and not hide my belly fat. The large did fall perfectly in that concern."
2.0,It's a little tight under the arms.  Other than that the color and style is nice.
2.0,"It says sherpa lined, its fleece lined."
2.0,"Fast shipping, nice charms, however only received 11 out of the 14, will be returning"
2.0,"It was ok, a little cheap looking and arrived broken."
2.0,Really loose and floppy. Extremely hard to lace up.
2.0,The tank rides up horribly!!! And the neck is a super tight seam. The seam will snap if I try to stretch it. Super cheap!
2.0,"i got a small and it fit me like a large! mind you, i'm 5'4, 130lbs! Returned."
2.0,Was not adequate for flow.
2.0,NOT a tee shirt. It is a see through polyester blend. Pretty shirt. Bright colors. Just feel that the title is very misleading.
2.0,This product is not as expected and as glittery as seens in picture. The chin is fine but the cut of the crystal does not seem that good.
2.0,Doesn't fit well on a small ear. The flower itself is nice: the stones are clear and brilliant and the plating is smooth. The flower has a high profile that catches my hair and that moves it if it doesn't just pull it off. The cuff is not really adjustable and bending the metal even by a small degree  causes the thin plating to crack (see photo).
2.0,I was traveling to cold weather and needed something to help keep me warm. This did the trick but at the cost of having fur or something from the scarf all over my clothes.
2.0,The sword was smaller than anticipated.
2.0,"My husband loved this wallet for the first couple of months, but after that it became stretched out and his cards/money etc kept falling out."
2.0,"Honestly, the floral design is pretty....but that's it. It's very cheaply made.  The leather is poor quality and the way they have it where it attaches just looks terrible. I hate the little space that they couldne bother to cover with the black or design. Also, if pulled two hard it seems like it could just rip right off..."
2.0,backs too small lost both first time putting them on
2.0,The seams of this two piece set are so poorly sewn unfortunately. There are strings hanging off all over the place. It's cute but since it's poorly made it looks more like pajamas rather than a lounge set
2.0,bottoms fit top did not
2.0,"I GREW UP SHINING SHOES.  ALL MY BROTHERS AND I SHINED SHOES AS JOB GROWING UP.  TAUGHT SHOE SHINING AS A BASIC TRAINING INSTRUCTOR AND JROTC INSTRUCTOR.  I'M SAYING THAT TO SAY THAT YOUR DYE IS THE WORST I'VE EVER USED.  THE QUALITY IS A 3 ON A SCALE FROM 1 TO 10.  HATE TO BE SO BLUNT, BUT YOU ASKED ME FOR A REVIEW.  THIS IS IT."
2.0,"The reviews are correct. The product does not look as advertised, the buckle is just painted on (in a different color purple, more blueish). They are completely flat but I think with a little tissue paper and maybe some pipe cleaners they might to the trick (under a long dress). I was going to return them but figured for the price I would just give it shot!"
2.0,Very soft well printed but size xxl fits more like a kinda baggy lg
2.0,"Ill give it two stars because they were super cute , but the pink one broke as soon as i put on my keys and haven’t even given my friend the other yet ! Im sad gunna request a refund"
2.0,"These are very short. I ordered medium and no tag inside to indicate size, no size on bag. They appear to run small and the material is stiff. Not sure if I will return them but I am afraid they will shrink and I will not be able to wear them"
2.0,"I think I would have liked the dress, however it was TINY.  I did alot of research with other reviews and the sizecharts to get a good idea of the sizing beforehand, but when the dress came I couldn't make the ends meet together in the center."
2.0,Was like a boys medium when I got it. Fast shipping though. Must order an 8X to get an actual 2X mens. Not sure whos sizing these.
2.0,"I shouldn’t have expected much for the money, but it is very cheaply made and doesn’t really fit right. It is made out of thin T-Shirt material."
2.0,"gim, dislike the hem."
2.0,"Looks like the picture, however it is cheaply made and not cute at all. Not worth returning so I will more than likely be donating this to Goodwill. I do not recommend this dress!!"
2.0,"I wanted to love this bracelet - I really did. The colors of the crystals &amp; stones in the image looked bright and and clear, and the bracelet seemed delicate and easy to wear. I waited for the price to drop (if fluctuates wildly, for some reason) and made my order. Boy, was I surprised.<br /><br />Even at the low price-point, this bracelet is not worth the cost. The &quot;stones&quot; are nothing of the sort - they are plastic. Some of them are actually clear plastic coated with the color of the stone it's supposed to be, and it chips off almost immediately. It's certainly a light-weight piece - because it's all plastic!<br /><br />I'm very unhappy with this product and would NOT recommend it - unless you plan on wearing it once to party or something... but even at that, it's not worth the money."
2.0,"Warning: may be made by the Texas Chainsaw Killer! Why? Where the sleeves attach to the bodice, the opening is so small that it feels as though the job is to remove your arms! The sleeves are fine, the fit of the dress is fine, but the arm holes are killers! When first putting the dress on, it doesn't seem any more snug than the rest of this form fitting bodice, but within 10 minutes, the issue becomes apparent. Sad, too, because everything about the dress made it a keeper.<br />When I took it in to have it altered in order to try and wear it again, even the tailor laughed at how small the arm holes were. Not cool, dude. Not cool."
2.0,Just to email
2.0,"Are nice, but too fragile... Do not seat on it or drop it, you'll lose them. Definitely, you get what you pay."
2.0,"This shoe seemed well enough made, but the plastic connectors that connect the heel to the shoe rubbed my daughters feet raw to the point that she had bloody sores. They could not be worn without socks. I wound up giving them away."
2.0,Had to edit my review because these turned out to have a hole in them
2.0,"Disappointed because the key chain was broken upon delivery, the money clip works well for holding the bills securely."
2.0,"Beautiful skirt, but was no as long as I expected."
2.0,When together it works well fits the watch well. The issue is the bar is in two pieces which allows it to move and loosen the screws when you wear it. It needs to be one solid piece. It also makes it extremely hard to put together with the piece falling out constantly. I was lucky as a friend found my watch on the ground after it unscrewed itself. Going to look for something better built.
2.0,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I just received this in the mail and I'm so irritated. Both pieces look terrible. In fact they look as though they were used and then washed or something - the tail is not at all fluffy and the whiskers on the head band are also flat and coming out in pieces. Somehow the picture makes the 2 ears look cute but in reality they are even closer together, almost at the vertex, they're not tilted at all, just standing up straight, and it looks really strange. The construction is really shoddy too, the seam on the head band shows up on the outside instead of being inside."
2.0,Its really small you can hardly see it when you wear them
2.0,"Nice looking watch, but this thing is definitely a fake.  For $100 I guess it should have been obvious.  It's a knock-around watch."
2.0,just got it delivered today and it's already coming apart and missing one of the studs. It's closer to a khaki than the ivory in the picture. Definitely returning
2.0,These are not comfortable for man parts whatsoever. No consideration in the fabrication of this item for men's anatomy.
2.0,They are a bit oversized. Probably better fit for a man. One of the skull patterns were too large which would not line up with anyones face.
2.0,The shirts are super small and very poor quality.
2.0,"I wear a size small in almost everything. I'm 5'8"" tall and 124 lbs. I am athletic, but I can barely get a size small of this shirt over my arms. The compression is really there! I'm going to see if a large works and will comment on it, then. I'm looking for something other than Nikibiki's. I love Nikibiki's but the material pills up too much. We'll try this again!"
2.0,Soft and comfy but the image printed noticeably crooked. Not too happy overall.
2.0,"This is such a cute item and looks terrific on, but unfortunately I'll be returning it. Today after wearing it for the 2nd time - it hasn't been laundered yet - I see the fabric is pilling like crazy. I wouldn't even wear it to work, it looks old. Too bad, because it's cute and very flattering."
2.0,ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT SIZES SO BE WILLING TO SHARE CUZ SOME YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIT. THE BOW FITS MY PINKY FINGER LIKE I REGULAR RING. THE SKULL FITS MY FIVE YEAR OLD'S PINKY LIKE A REGULAR RING
2.0,size is way off and I only ordered 1 pair and I paid for 2...VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!
2.0,I like this dress but I will be wearing it with leggins and some sort of cardigan over it its like an over-sized shirt with a belt..I am tall 5'7 and i just wont wear this as a dress
2.0,The dress was real nice and I got a lot of complements but the front of the dress was ripped and the stitching was coming out  had to sew and fix the dress because it was ripped and the stitching was coming out. I couldn't return the dress because I received the dress the day of my event. I would like to return the dress I shouldn't have to fix something that was destroyed on the dress.
2.0,I ordered a 12 14  but it fit like a size 8 9
2.0,This dress runs small and is made of uncomfortable polyester material. It looks great in pictures but in real life it lacks alot.
2.0,This dress looked promising but does not lay the same on me as it does in the image. The waistline sat too far above my waistline and not high enough to be considered empire. The belted section is actually separate and loops into a gap on the side. It would not lay right either. It just kept riding up above the midsection and looked awkward. The side split on the dress was a lot shorter too. It was mostly one solid seam so the entire style and silhouette of the bottom was very different. I went with the amazon recommended size and advice from reviews. It was still a little big. This may be my particular problem. I would like to size down but for now it is going back. Being that this dress is almost entirely polyester it does seem the type to snag easy and and a tear would probably run pretty big.
2.0,"I so wanted this bag to work. I loved the damask and the vinyl straps in the photo. Unfortunately, in person, it's not quite as nice looking.<br /><br />The damask does not have as high of contrast and so the pattern doesn't stand out as much.<br /><br />Also, the bag feels like it's made out of the same material used to make parkas. It's thick and makes noise like a ski jacket makes. This is not really what someone would expect or want in a purse.<br /><br />So, unfortunately, this one had to go back."
2.0,"Beautiful , I was excited to receive it...<br />it broke within 5 min of wearing, I am returning for exchange"
2.0,They are cute but the bottoms rolled up when bending over etc.  I was specifically looking for some that did not roll.
2.0,"Terrible material, very cheap looking"
2.0,bones on the sides dig in-in time it's rather painful. would like to receive a return label. will continue to shop with you for another style strapless.
2.0,"Beautiful ring!  Had a few rough edges, but after wearing they wore down. Highly recommend.  A few weeks have gone by, and still love the ring.  However, the silver finish is already wearing off.  I only wear this ring when going out, so expected the finish to last longer.  So changing my rating to two stars, and would not purchase again."
2.0,"I debated about rating this too small or too large since it's really both. I sized up a little (I typically wear a US16-18, and purchased the 3X) and it looks like I sized up 2-3 sizes (it's far too baggy in most areas); however, it was somewhat snug (and odd fitting) in the chest area (I'm a 38DDD) with my bra being exposed through the stretched arm holes. I'm fairly sure if I bought an XL or 2x it would have been far too tight in the chest. I bought this for an informal holiday party and the fit was so odd and the material so cheap feeling (it has the look and feel of a cheap Halloween costume) that I was too embarrassed to wear it. I think if you are more of a pear shape, size down, and it might fight nicely, but if you are at all chest-heavy, look elsewhere. The pattern is pretty, so I'm thinking I'll repurpose it by turning it into hair scrunchies or a throw pillow instead of returning it. Note, there is no way the dress I received is the one in the picture as the dress I received could not possibly have a flared out (A-line) shape without a petticoat, nor would it ever hold pleats (the cheap and thin material would always just hang down). I'm definitely disappointed in this purchase."
2.0,"No support for the bust & way too large.  It would be better if you could buy them separately.  The bottoms look like I'm wearing a diaper.  I think you have to have a bit of a torso to pull off the high waisted bottoms.  The top I could've wrapped around me twice.  I'm 5'3, 36D and wear a size 12 and ordered up a size per other comments.<br /><br />From the pics, it looks like this works for others, but definitely not for me. :("
2.0,"No stretch, runs small.  Pretty but size up 1 size."
2.0,"The lace shoulders look delicatenin the picture and seem like an upgrade to your standqrd white tee. Instead of lace they are heavy crochet, do not lay down, feel awkward and even curl in random directions after washing. This shirt looks and feels like you are wearing football shoulder pads and is not really what i expected and defenitely not a shirt i like.  Do not recomend."
2.0,Nice boot but not true to size.. too narrow
2.0,"Too small, poor quality."
2.0,"10/48 came damaged and unusable. Some dirty, paint maybe?"
2.0,"I do not like this cardigan. It's very thin and while it's cute it's more of a summer cardigan. It's not as long as it seems or as thick. Nothing like the picture. I was fooled by the advertisement. I still kind of like it however, I was very dissapointed."
2.0,"I have the “Space Aop” shirt.  There is one MAJOR “flaw” with this tee-shirt.  The work “Space” is spelled both backwards and upside-down.  If the work were both upside-down and right-side-up, then I could understand it.  But as it is, I really think this is a glaring “flaw”.  The shirt is nice and soft.  It’s your typical tee-shirt.  It’s Made in Malaysia, so at the current price of thirteen bucks for only one shirt, it’s super crazy expensive. You should receive at least three or four for this price."
2.0,Much smaller  then depicted
2.0,I have large wrists and the band digs into my skin . Thought because it was a expansion band it would fit better
2.0,Cheaply made. Move on.
2.0,Nice product but runs small. Would work well for toddler
2.0,Bought a 9-10 year old size for my 6 yo because she normally wears an 8. This is smaller than some of her size 6 clothes. She wont let me return it because she loves the bunny....but it is TINY!!!! washed once...SUPER SHRINK factor. Buy 3 sizes too large if you really want this.
2.0,"too small, material to stretchy and flimsy for my taste.  sending it back."
2.0,"This hat is way to small for me! My hat size is 6 7/8 and there is no way I can make this cap fit me. Maybe if I was bald I could pull it down onto my head, but that would be difficult as well because there is no stretch/give in the material."
2.0,This outfit looks nice but very poorly put together. It wasn’t worth the money they wanted nor the time that it took to get here. Disappointing.
2.0,"They are pretty, but so far, the first few pairs my 4 year old wore fell off within a first few hours :((. So sad, had high hopes for this product."
2.0,It just wasn't made for my body type.<br />Big boobs<br />Small waist<br />Wide hips.<br />Just no.
2.0,"Snag,snag,snag....within not even an 1hr of having them on.<br />The only reason I gave them 3 stars,<br />otherwise comfy."
2.0,The design/image is really cool but the necklace broke for my son the first day and the charm fell off and got lost. Not kid proof.
2.0,the crown is off set so you cant really put it on your head and use it
2.0,Writing portrayed in picture is readable. When in actual pendent not even readable with magnifying glass
2.0,"In the photo I thought this looks like a bathing suit bottom but they really look like underwear. That’s also the feedback I got from friends. Which I appreciate, I want people that will tell me if I have spinach in my teeth or look like I wore granny panties to the beach. The fit is also very loose, like zero cling to my body.  I should have sent them back."
2.0,"Not happy with this purse. It does seem to be real leather. But the inside of the purse is not lined. It's not a big purse. And for some reason, the zipper doesn't go all the way across the top!!! Ridiculous! It's not worth the money they are asking for! I hate having to return stuff! Ugh!"
2.0,"I must have too much money. Wow, who knew! I can't even close this little wallet with all my cash."
2.0,The lens part was not clear to see through.
2.0,"Very disappointed. I ordered Rose Gold, and the glasses that came are a hideous GREEN-ish bronze. On top of that, the glasses are way too big and give a very insect-like appearance. They look like they're made from cheap materials. The only redeeming quality is that the angles on the actual glasses matched the degree of the angles advertised."
2.0,"Cute pattern but after only a few wears the seam on pants is already ripping, which I'm not happy about. I had sized up because I'm pregnant, so they fit fine, but I'd definitely advise others to size up, too."
2.0,"Very short lifespan; two washings and it is misshapen. Sleeves and torso shrunk up at least 2.5 inches and it stretched out even more so it looks like a maternity blouse.  I also thought the fabric was uncomfortable, not soft like I expected 100% cotton to be."
2.0,I have no doubt that if you could actually get your hand into a baseball glove wearing this that it would stop any sting/pain  from happening. our problem was we couldn't get our hand in any baseball glove using this because it is very bulky.
2.0,"I regret buying this hoodie because it does not seem to deflect cold wind. It fit as expected but the material on the inside is not soft so it loses another star for comfortability. Unfortunately, I can't afford to toss 20 dollars down the drain so I still wear it occasionally."
2.0,Stitching was not properly done
2.0,"So disappointed....Cute style. Everything would have fit great if they hadn’t sewn elastic across the back so tight. By sewing the elastic across the back, it makes the front pull wayyyy too tight across the bust area and it pulls & puckers weirdly. I’m a 36-C, so not hugely busty. No elastic and it would have fit & draped perfectly! I sew and considered undoing all the stitching and removing the elastic and then sewing it up again, because I love the look of the scalloped V neck (cute under a jacket or by itself) and the fabric is just what I was looking for (soft with a nice polished sheen). But truly, for the cost of the camisole, it’s not worth the hour or two of my time to rip out all the stitches and then re-sew, so it’s going back. My search continues... Oh! I usually wear a Med., but ordered a Large.<br />UPDATE! Okay, I know I said I wasn’t going to do it...BUT I did. After getting rid of the elastic and re-hemming  the raw edge, it now fits perfectly and looks great! But if I didn’t know how to sew, I would not waste money paying someone else to do it for me. Might fit okay for smaller chested ladies (?), but still don’t think so (that elastic pulls TIGHT!) Gave it 2 stars because I like the style, but had to reconstruct it to fit properly."
2.0,"The wristwatch look very very cheap, especially the red ring around the face made of opaque red plastic, but the bracelet is very nice and the magnet very powerful that keep it close.- It was returned immediately."
2.0,"My 9-year-old son is a size 4 tennis shoe. His feet are skinny.  The heel of the medium sock only went to the middle of his foot. The legs are stretchy but the bottoms of the feet are not very stretchy.  If they fit correctly, I think they would be decent quality."
2.0,Not a flattering dress.  Would look much better for someone in petite sizes.
2.0,They were an XL and were too small.  I gave them to my wife who likes them.
2.0,"I was initially very impressed with this watch - it has a fashionable big face with an unusual interesting look. I thought for around $20 it was quite the steal. I also really liked the mesh metal band and the belt like closure instead of the typical clasp.<br /><br />However, after several uses, the metal coating on the face started to look discolored and looked like it was peeling off in some places. I guess you get what you pay for...<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review."
2.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED. Like the robe but it is way too small. l don't know what to do. How do l handle returning this? My puppy got a hold of the package it came in. (l know the dog ate my homework) There was no packing slip.
2.0,Got a infection from jewelry.
2.0,"broke within 2 weeks on my 6 year old, who is not hard on shoes. Flimsy connector."
2.0,Runs small and the red is more like hot pink. It's being returned.
2.0,Want to send it back -
2.0,"Two of the three of the shirts began coming undone after the first wash. However, I do know how to sew, so I did patch it back up myself and continued to wear them. Not ideal, but you get what you pay for. The shirt also rides up with movement, but it does keep you dry through intense workouts. It does fit as expected. I would not purchase these again."
2.0,"I ordered a small. My sizes are usually a small or 0/2 and I'm a 32B. Neither the top nor the bottom are reversible (the top is the same pattern on both sides, while the bottom is patterned on one side and can't be worn on the other side). Also, the bottoms are tiny. I am always a small (size 0 or 2) and I have average hips and the bottoms cut into my skin a little. The top is also different than the picture and skimpier as well. It almost looks like my boobs are going to fall out if it moves slightly. It's still wearable, but bad quality."
2.0,"This hat fits and looks just like in the photo: it is large, floppy and un-shapable, crunchy and stiff.  I have not been motivated to wear it or return it!!  Just a disappointment."
2.0,"My 4 year old grand daughter begged for these and within a couple days they were broken, and yes I understand she is 4 but she is very much a princess who takes very good care of her jewelry."
2.0,"Do not care for the top at all. So, sorry to disagree with you who I based my purchase on however, in my opinion, this is cheaply top made.<br />The buttons on the shoulder seem as though they were accidentally applied to the wrong top. The three buttons weigh almost more than the top itself.<br />I suggest spending your hard earned money on a  quality fabric and well made garment. In my opinion, you will not find either here.<br />Merry Christmas to you and your family.<br />God Bless America"
2.0,"My wrist bumped the smaller button 3x within first 5 minutes on my wrist , somehow called 911 and of course they stopped by."
2.0,Was very disappointed that this fit like youth size
2.0,"I’m typically a 28 in pants. I ordered a 29, because I like my shorts loose. Shorts show up, and they sent my a 30. I tried them on anyways, and they fit. Couldn’t imagine trying to squeeze into a 29, let alone a 28. Wish their sizing was more consistent, and they sent what you actually ordered. Luckily the error worked in my favor."
2.0,I love the style but don’t like the slinky fabric nor the placement of the pockets. Because the pockets are on the side seams they poof out and make you look wide. Not flattering at all. The fabric makes it uncomfortable to wear on a hot day. I would have preferred a cotton t-shirt fabric.
2.0,"They are see through and doesn't have cups ,so I returned them plus they where short and not very supporting"
2.0,"Looks cheap, the color isn’t rich.. it looks muddy brown"
2.0,I really like this watch tells great time & has a date window to display the date but the watch will quit running if you don't wear it for over 24 hours & with my experience it must be worn a minimum of 4 -12 hours per day to keep from stopping at a random time also I haven't had luck with it being a  Perpetual Calendar it failed to move to the correct date in Feb & is failing again today on 4/30/18 to change to the 1st rather than 31st
2.0,"couldn't wear them,didnt realize huggie earrings meant small earrings ... they look nice though"
2.0,I liked the style and materials. The dress was too loose
2.0,I ordered this dress to wear to my brother's wedding.  I ordered it early so I could return it if needed.  I received it and LOVED it!  Tried it on and it fit wonderfully.  I was super excited to wear it to the wedding.  Fast forward to the day of the wedding when I was ironing it and found it to have 2 holes in the seam.  I had no choice but to wear the dress as the wedding was only a couple hours later and there was no time (or place) to find a new dress and I was out of my return window.  I never thought I'd need to check all the seams to make sure they were intact.  By the end of the night almost the whole seam had ripped open.  I was so disappointed as I loved the dress and had plans for many more wears!!!
2.0,Adorable shoes but the flowers don't stay on and then the finish is ripped so they look old after only a few wears. Also tried gluing them back on and they don't stay. The bottoms look like they are going to fall apart too. Not good quality for the price.
2.0,It does not look as<br />Modern as it does in the picture.
2.0,I did not like the fabric and did not feel well with my body type.
2.0,The boot pinches my daughters foot and the construction is shaggy. We had Ariats before and they were much better. Material looks cheap.
2.0,"Small umbrella purchased for trip to Europe as it easily fits into backpack or large purse.  Held up well to rain and a bit of wind when used 2-3 times.  Unfortunately, I discovered that the strap that wraps around the umbrella to keep it closed when not in use was not fully stitched on at the factory, so I expect it to tear after a few more uses."
2.0,"It’s a fine product as far as I can tell but I’ve never actually worn it. Tried to return and ran out of time to send it in. The gold parts look great, but the beads in the center look and feel very cheap. They make the whole band feel somewhat juvenile."
2.0,Got my grandson all excited about these shoes that you could control with a button and they would stay lit or flash or change colors.....great design....until one stopped working!!  It wouldn't charge up either.
2.0,"Cute and comfy, yes. But seriously been rocking them for 2 weeks now and this fuzz sheds EVERYWHERE. I am waiting to have fuzz-less slippers after a few more wears. was hoping after some time it would stop but seriously find black fur balls EVERYWHERE."
2.0,Very small and I bought a large
2.0,"Junk. Two of them don’t have a way to adjust the tightness, so they fall down on my kids’ faces. Would not buy again. Kids have worn them three times."
2.0,"Bought these for my ten-year-old daughter, who needed some basic black leggings.  They looked and fit well, but after only several weeks of wearing and washing, they are full of holes.  Pretty disappointing."
2.0,NOT cotton
2.0,"The sizing is good, but the color was darker than expected and the print was slightly off center 😩"
2.0,Be careful 2 sizes too small eventhough it was  an extra large
2.0,"Neck was large and loose, overall too big for size stated"
2.0,These earrings turned black where it touched my ears within a couple weeks. The flowers are really cute so it's was very disappointing when they started being discolored.
2.0,I was disappointed in this collection because of the colors. The picture included with the description shows some really pretty stones. The ones I got are not pretty but dreary. There was a wide variety of colors in the picture but I did not receive that variety. They are wired nicely and stones are nice but not what I thought I would get.
2.0,This product is a horrible fit.  Looks like a droopy diaper in the back seat.
2.0,The watch broke on the band.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"The wife like it and she is a medium and this shirt fits like a large.  But other then that.... would not buy this again,,,,, Sorry!!!"
2.0,Nice material but xxl was too small I like them more roomy
2.0,"the quality isn't too great, and it was very small on me, I kept having to pull it down"
2.0,Fits somewhat small.  I would not consider these shirts “compression” shirts.  They do not meet my expectation.
2.0,"Dress is beautiful and a great price but it comes from China. So if you need this before 30 days, don’t order it. But if you can wait 30 days to receive it, it is the perfect dress for you. Also, if for some reason you have an issue with it you have to pay for shipping. Back to China."
2.0,The size was to small didnt match the size I ordered
2.0,Todo muy bien pero dejo de funcionar y nadie se va echo responsable.
2.0,"Have had 2 pairs of these and they tend to run small....especially after laundering, even when it is done exactly as specified.<br />I would buy a size larger for them to be truly comfortable.I returned them."
2.0,"I loved these pants when I put them on so much that I ordered more pairs in different colors right away. They fit well and were soft, cool and comfortable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by the time I reached my office, the waist had stretched out enough that I wished I’d had a belt. It seemed like no big deal at first; an easy fix. By the end of the work day, the waist had stretched out so much that they literally FELL DOWN when I stood up at my desk! Thankfully, I was alone, but if I could give 0 stars, I would!"
2.0,I ordered the smallest one and it was still a little big. A little loose not as form fitting as I'd hoped
2.0,"It seems like the bar isn’t long enough, you can’t see either set of stones on the short ones."
2.0,Had the lenses for less than a month and they started crazing on the exterior of the lenses for an unknown reason. Sending them back and replacing with authentic Oakley lenses.
2.0,"For $30, pass on these, the red color anyways.<br />  This is our third pair of Feetmat Shoes. I bought the red and gray color for my 7 year old son in April. He wore for 1 month at school, then only on nice occasions during the summer. Now shoes are junk by end of October - only 3 months of actual wear. The velcro came off the strap, I glued it back on, but made a difficult lump to work around. Strap runs thru a metal buckle - buckle fell off, so I made a new one. The shoe fronts are ripping, and PU material is flaking. Ouch!<br /> The other 2 pairs were a different colors-blue/green, and blue. The blue seemed to hold up for last month of school and all summer use. The blue green pair has only 2 months of school and still looks great!"
2.0,"Super tight at thighs, for curvey girls... this is a NO."
2.0,"Service was pretty fast. But shirt seems like it's sized for boys, not men."
2.0,Cute..but made for a small build. I bought the extra large I am an 8 to 10.Way to tight on the top.  Gave it away.
2.0,I was looking for some high impact bras and these just don't do the job.  They look fine when worn but definitely do not give the support needed for running or high impact activities.
2.0,I didn’t care for these.  The elastic they held the mitten part off of your fingers broke the first day.
2.0,I have so much trouble finding high waisted jeans. I bought Gloria Vanderbilt jeans years ago. Stopped buying them because they lose their shape and are very baggy. Thought I would buy them again hoping they made them better. Nope. Not better. Wore them 2 hours. Very very baggy. I do not like baggy jeans.
2.0,I ordered size up than my usual size yet its still too small. It looks really nice but it looks like it covers my nipples only.
2.0,"I bought this for my mom, who is tall and thin-to-medium build, in the M/L. The arms were way too tight, it was much shorter than pictured (certainly not tunic length), and the cowl was pretty extreme."
2.0,Supper cute but cheap. Was expecting a better metal for the price. Drop them and already bent where my small 5 year old just stepped on them.
2.0,"Too short/wide, not as shown."
2.0,I like the color and style but was smaller then I expected and does not fit very comfortably
2.0,Expect to be pulling these up constantly. You'll be feeling the breeze in your crack for sure.
2.0,broke within a hour of wearing it
2.0,Unfortunatly I loved the bracelet but my jeweler said it was not 14 k gold so I had to send it back asked if the next one I ordered had 14 K on she said yes!
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:186b4e101ee422147df57fd43691ac5d]] I bought this as a HELL YEA to ending chemotherapy. Have worn it everyday for a month, 8 or 9 stones are missing now. Not as shiny as day 1 but of course that's understandable. But turning my finger green isn't! Very dissatisfied."
2.0,These socks to not have the anti slips I was looking for.
2.0,"Very attractive color and nice fabric but they are gigantic. The rise goes all the way up to my armpits. I normally wear an XL in pull on pants, but I ordered an L in the and they look like clown pants. I can roll the waist 2x and wear them around the house but I cannot wear them in public. Geez."
2.0,"The material is very soft and I like the overall concept of a bomber-style sweater.  However, the cut is a huge fail.  I bought an XS and it was way too tight in the armpits, but the mid-section and bottom hem would fit as a Medium or Large.  No good."
2.0,"Very cute, but broke immediately. Just a chain issue, but broke within the first day."
2.0,The bifocal part sits on top of the lense. It is not incorporated into the lenses.
2.0,Beads are much larger than I thought
2.0,Didn't look new.
2.0,Gems fell out in the packaging while shipping. Superglued them back in and it held up fine for the occasion I had bought it for.
2.0,"These gloves are very asthetically pleasing, fit well and kept my hands warm in 30 degree temperature.  BUT the very first time using these to do some shoveling the seam on the right thumb opened horribly.  A shame since these looked and felt very nice"
2.0,"The skirt fits and looks great. The problem is that I wore this skirt twice and both times happened to be wearing a long, cross-body purse. Where the purse it the skirt, the skirt became very pilly - like a sweater. Now it looks messy. I know this skirt was super cheap, but I would hope for more than two wearings."
2.0,"These might be knee high on a child! They were way to short to reach my knees, let alone cover them. I'll give them an extra star because the fabric felt nice, but I was overall disappointed with the purchase and returned them."
2.0,"Disappointed. Pattern is beautiful. Colors are vibrant. However:<br />1. Fabric is very thin, see through (exactly like those freebie lens cleaning cloths).<br />2. Construction is cheap. Stitching appeared to be done by someone who was not familiar with a serger/overlock machine. Excess thread bundles everywhere. Particularly at the elastic waist band.<br />3. The flared leg openings were no way near as big as shown in the ad photo. Really disappointed on this point."
2.0,I am a size 12-14 and ordered XL. I really hoped the XL would give a bigger fit. It did not! It does not fit. I feel like I wasted my money. Would like a refund!!!!
2.0,Good glasses but very bad packaging... The nose came very bent (turned).. I had to adjust the whole glasses to make them look decent.
2.0,All torn up and 3 sizes bigger than what I wanted don’t buy
2.0,I love the feeling and fit of this brand. I have purchased a few pairs in the last 2 weeks. However I was highly disappointed when I received this pair of teal camo leggings. They have pilling all over the side of the legs.
2.0,"After wearing these for about 20 minutes, I had to take them off and put them back in the envelope to return to Amazon. They felt great at first, but after just walking around my house, bending to pick up items, and sitting down and standing up, they were driving me crazy. The crotch area drooped to well below where it should, and the waistband folded well below my belly button. These leggings have terrific reviews, they are inexpensive, and may work for some, but I am going to spend more money for better quality leggings."
2.0,Fell apart the very first time I wore it. That's in contrast to a Peora chain I've worn every day & night for the past 3 years. Nice looking though.
2.0,Didn't like the way it fit to tight in some places and to loose in others. Tight against chest to loose on shoulders.
2.0,"Nearly as expected... I ordered purple, received black ones"
2.0,My daughter saved her money to buy this for her besties for Christmas.  One necklace broke within the first few minutes of wear when the little metal bit that holds the chain broke.  Not well made.
2.0,Did not take long for the foam padding in the sole of these to go flat in many places. My feet also had a tendency to slide to the side under the Eevee head. Ultimately I didn't wear them long.
2.0,I bought a 3x it buttons but if you sit down it unsnaps
2.0,"Bought this for my daughter, and she was unhappy with the material. She said it gathered, and fit very large."
2.0,Hats were much smaller and tighter than I anticipated.
2.0,Didn't wear well at all. Actually had one split. And they caused rash on the finger. As a person who is not allergic to silicone this was disappointing.
2.0,"I bought this for a costume and plan on altering it heavily and dying it, so it's working for what I need it for. Overall it already seems to have a Halloween-costumey look. The fabric is pretty shiny and as one reviewer said, cheap looking. I wore it to the store immediately after receiving it and the way it clung to and in between my legs was pretty uncomfortable. I'm 5'4"" and 160lbs in the picture. I think some of the colors may be different lengths, according to other reviewers. This one goes to the bottom of my ankles; I wouldn't really call that a Maxi skirt. I bought a small because it's the only size they had pink in. The elastic waist band barely fits, so if you're a similar size, go for a medium. I'm wearing black leggings underneath in these photos, so it's pretty see-through. The under skirt is weirdly short. It barely covers the top of my thighs; kind of defeats the purpose of a slip. Also in case you can't tell from the photos, the back of the waist band is fabric bunched around elastic, while the front of the waist band is smooth, as shown in product photos. I would not buy this as a fashion or wardrobe piece. There are far cuter, less expensive options."
2.0,"This is a cute bathing suit but the protective a shield they put in the bottom leaves sticky gooey residue. I haven't worn the bathing suit yet, I'm still trying to get that out. I've wash it twice in hot water and applied stain stick and still can not get the glue out!"
2.0,Glad to find 13mm size but the quality is below par.
2.0,"Looks so beautiful in the picture, but in person so thin and so short"
2.0,"Jacket is very thin, made from what looks to be yarn. Only the hood is fleece lined"
2.0,"I loved these shoes so much, and if they would have lasted longer than a couple of months, I would have given them a five star rating. However, I bought these boots in January and they are already falling apart. The sole from one shoe totally separated from the shoe itself and ended up in the trash within five months of owning them."
2.0,I was not happy with fit but I kept the dress.
2.0,Not light like picture verydark
2.0,I thought the lining at the top was gold and it was silver.  It looked like something you would wear as a star trek fan to comic con.
2.0,I ordered a medium and it’s extremely long and loose. Definitely watch your measurements! (It could be a short short dress)
2.0,If you’re busty definitely go up an extra size. The top elastic is very constrictive. It’s a nice dress but absolutely hate the material. It’s a scratchy poly blend. Not silky feeling like I had hoped. Will not be buying additional colors
2.0,"I wanted to love these, and for the most part I do, but they are short length. I have a 33 inch inseam, nothing wild and these are the most unflattering highwaters these need to be at least 2-3"" longer to fit like the picture.. They are not true to size so I had to order two sizes up. I normally wear 10/12 and ordered at XXL. They fit tight when you first put them on but do stretch out during the day."
2.0,If you order the blush pink just<br />Know it’s more of a bright bubblegum pink.
2.0,Glitter  comes off and gets everywhere I don't even wear it anymore
2.0,Cute but runs small. Had to return it.
2.0,"order at least a size down, maybe even 2<br />thigh holes are really big<br />quality is okay"
2.0,the chains are very long. They drag on the ground. I step on them even.
2.0,To two big rings are super small. Didn’t even fit on my pinky and my wedding band is a size 4 1/2. The rest are fine.
2.0,"This is not a bright army green as shown, it is a ugly dull heather-ed  brownish green color"
2.0,Very beautiful shoe. The fit is a bit narrow but the lights does not work. My son was heart broken.  Will be returning them.
2.0,Goggle started leaking after having it for only two weeks.
2.0,"I order this fro myself, an 11 year old and when it came, it was way to big! It’s very pretty, but I would recommend getting 2-3 sizes down considering how large it was."
2.0,I put them on and they fell down like they were low rise shorts
2.0,Used to shovel and blow snow. Didn't keep hand warm or dry for long. Failed the test.
2.0,Too short. Very unhappy. I'm 5'4 and its like a mini dress on me.
2.0,"i am 5'3&#34;, 110 lbs, 34C, and the cups were way too high for me.  I have a slightly shorter than average torso and I think this bathing suit is better for long torso people."
2.0,I am going to have to alter it.  Ridiculously LARGE.  It is a one-size-fits-all And I'm a 8-10.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Was too big and bulky. Thought it would be smaller and fit more secure.
2.0,"This is actually not what I thought it would be. In the pictures it looks like a much higher quality dress and when I opened it, I was disappointed to find a dress that just has a design stamped on it and it's made entirely of what feels like Spandex but is probably Rayon or something similar in fabric style. I'll definitely be returning it and getting the $16 I paid for it."
2.0,This was just way too small had to return!
2.0,I bought a medium and it fits like a small..  it’s a nice coat but disappointed it doesn’t fit-
2.0,Way small and not squat proof
2.0,I like the shirt but it came in with a long brown stain along the left side of the shirt. Very disappointing
2.0,"This was a nice fabric, nice weight, but the white is completely see through. Also, several of the seems were coming apart and unraveling."
2.0,Soy 5'2 el pantalón muy largos
2.0,The tops come loose way to easy and fall out. I've swallowed two already....
2.0,Cant really complain much. They are FOakleys<br />But the lenses were scratched and there wasnt a nose piece
2.0,They seamed tarnished when i received them. I returned them.
2.0,These don’t stay up and are horrible
2.0,"Although the piece is very beautiful, the clip on the upper ear is extremely painful. So painful in fact, that I have worn it once and its been sitting in a drawer ever since. When I did wear it, I was in pain 90% of the time. I tried different placements but the clip is simply too painful.<br /><br />Pros: beautiful statement piece, creative, unique<br />Cons: unwearable due to earring causing pain"
2.0,"Super small, 12-18 month more like 6 months."
2.0,"It’s a bit smaller than i thought it would be, and it is kind of cheap material"
2.0,To big and now I can't exchange it. I'm not happy with amazon
2.0,This item fits like a mess.
2.0,"No stretch whatsoever, big pieces of extra cloth inside that should have been trimmed, and suuuuper small. I wear a medium in American Apparel unisex sizing, and I couldn't even get this past my shoulders.<br /><br />Returned and got a refund- response was very quick!"
2.0,"Cheap looking.  A bit tight for the dress with which I wanted to wear it.  It would be good with pants, though."
2.0,These really hurt my ears-if you attempt to make them tighter they snap-too loose they fall off-either way the hurt like crazy!!!
2.0,En realidad es muy grande comparado a la foto
2.0,"I ended up returning these, they just didnt fit correctly and were not comfortable for me"
2.0,"I really liked that this dress has pockets, is a simple design, and short-sleeved. However, it was so ill-fitting, I had to take it to a tailor. She shortened the dress because it was too long, and she also fixed the waist. The waist was way too big, and the pockets were too low. Once she fixed those issues, the dress was perfect and I wear it all the time."
2.0,Not true to size ordered another tank from the same company for perfect this one was much smaller
2.0,"pretty, but MUCH bigger than pictured. beware if you don't like big jewelry. the roses keep flipping over to the wrong side, which is also annoying."
2.0,I ordered the green earrings & they were more blue than green!
2.0,Tore up pretty wuick
2.0,Pretty earrings but the clasp broke several weeks ago (late July) and I've thought about returning them as the clasp seems pretty flimsy. But I just noticed that the &#34;return window&#34; was over on July 21st and it's August 7th! What to do?
2.0,"Now at the bottom of the drawer & headed for donation. Shrunken, wrinkled mess. A little too tight & uncomfortable."
2.0,I gave it to good will very cheep was very disappointed!
2.0,Too big for a bracelet
2.0,Color faded in the first wash on warm. Really ridiculous and cute outfit but didn’t last long in our house.
2.0,Filled up with water on the inside between the to parts of the cup when it was washed:/
2.0,"This was very slinky and clingy gown.  Very unattractive to wear as a night shirt on an average American body..  Need a perfect body for this shirt.  Although cotton is mentioned in the presentation, there was no tag or label stating cotton content.  It also needs to be washed before wearing it because has a very strong chemical smell."
2.0,Another crap  product from China. Amazon should tell you when the product in made in China. They don't stay on your ears.
2.0,"It's pretty flimsy and tends to bunch up in places. From the photo, it looked like a segmented mat that unfolded. Nope, those lines you see are just the creases from the way it was folded up in the box. Those creases, despite the mat laying flat on a hardwood floor for two weeks, are still there. For what I paid, I would have been better off spreading a Hefty garbage bag under my bike.<br /><br />****Update after using for a month****<br /><br />Still has yet to fully flatten out. While the mat protects the floor, I'm just waiting for the day where my cleats rip right through as I'm getting on or off my bike. Just standing on the mat for a few seconds, in my cleats, leaves a nasty indentation."
2.0,"These looked awesome and it said ""kids."" We bought them for our 9yo. They arrived and looked just like the pictures! Then... We tried them on. They are super small and made for LITTLE kids! Toddlers even!"
2.0,Didn’t want to use after zipper did not function
2.0,Unraveled after wearing a couple times
2.0,"These say they are 2g but I would guess more like 4g. The plugs always fall out and get lost. Not much of a flare. When I tried to put any different pair of 2g plugs in my ears after trying a couple of these, I noticed how my ear holes closed up just enough so I need to re stretch them in order to go back to a true 2g size."
2.0,"I was very disappointed in the packaging and quality of this item . This was a gift and the packaging was poorly constructed inside and out.  In addition, the silicon necklace looks of poor quality that you could find in any 99 cent store."
2.0,"This dress was SO cute, and it had pockets! I wanted to like it so bad, with its light weight cotton blend, it would be a great summer dress. That being said, There were holes all over the stitching where they just missed sewing a seam together. It was unwearable and would make me question the quality of all things from this seller."
2.0,"This looked nice, but not functional. Here's what went wrong: torn on arrival, threading that is sewing wood pieces to paper is all undone, handle is awkward shape for parasol holding, and there is no hole in handle for a ribbon/string handle. It would be fine as decoration, but not as a functional parasol."
2.0,"The black rubber loop thing is very difficult to keep form slipping, as the silver metal ring does not do a good job of holding it in place.<br /><br />The black rubber loop is also super uncomfortable."
2.0,Poor quality and very narrow.
2.0,"I had bought bags like this before, but my car got stollen and bags where there. I bought this as a replacement about 4 months ago and the seams are already getting undone, they cant take the weight my old ones did."
2.0,This charm looked much bigger online and with larger crystals. It is much smaller and not as nice as shown. Would not recommend. Would really return it but too much hassle .
2.0,"The earrings looked larger on line so I was a little bit disappointed when they arrived. They are overly delicate in construction. One pulled off the earloop the second time that I wore them, and I only wore them to the office, not to a setting where they were under any physical stress."
2.0,"This belt is such a disappointment. Ordered as a gift for my fianc&eacute; on February 2nd, by April 14th the &#34;leather&#34; had ripped and its beyond repair. This was warn on a casual basis and ripped after only a few months. When it arrived I thought the quality was going to hold up and now I see why it's so well priced. The shipping was also delayed. I think this company should offer money back for their poorly made products."
2.0,They look nice but fog up really bad. I could not see anything and ended up having to take them off so I could see!
2.0,"To tight even orderedthe largest number ,are for skinny persons ,and can’t return"
2.0,"Love the design; however within the first week, the finish was tarnished."
2.0,I ordered the silver dress (silver and grey or white for the backing material) as pictured above with the brides but I received the apricot one (it’s gold with a tan backing material). How do I get the right dress? I need it by next month for an event? :(
2.0,I have two key fobs and I really wanted it to work. It took about three days for the primary strap that connects to your belt (or purse) to break. I could have lost it all if I had not noticed it dropping. Key FOB replacement is not cheap. I hope that somebody comes up with an almost simuler product of superior quality material. This case was very disappointing.
2.0,not what i expected.hard to use.
2.0,The product was for a gift to my best friend who loves fairy tail! She loved it however one of the keys had a major issue where the gem was sticking out. Or it was glued to the wrong spot! I like the product but I paid for everything to be perfect and it wasn't :/
2.0,Very thin material.  The fabric was not comfortable.
2.0,"I had a lot of high hopes for this bag as it seemed to be the perfect item for washing my bras. However, it is designed for tiny bras. I would say that if you wear anything over a D cup, your bras will not fit in here. Not even one. They should advertise that it is tiny. I was disappointed and returned it."
2.0,Wrist band is worn out very quickly..because draging to the other band. This band is near the zipper..while walking draging wrist band near the zipper band..
2.0,"I was expecting it to be big because I ordered a size up, but it fits really awkwardly. It’s says women’s shirt but it fits like men’s. The color is awkward and the material is stiff and scratchy."
2.0,This neck gaiter was to small. It fit like a child’s size.
2.0,Sadly fake a costume looking. Not worth getting honestly.
2.0,I wasn't crazy about it. Very cheap polyester and feels horrible on. Looks cute.
2.0,"The fabric was nice, but the buttons and button holes were very cheaply done. The dress was actually a little big on me and I am 4""11 with measurements of 39.5-31.3-42 with  no stomach, yet with every movement, the dress came unbuttoned! Also, the sleeves were ginormous! A person would have to have wrists of Sasquatch for the sleeves to fit!!I was just trying it on even to show my husband what I was thinking to wear to his work Christmas party! I gave the dress a 3 🌟 for stretch because the fabric itself does has stretch, but you will need to do some work on the dress itself before wearing it, like closing up the button holes a bit or change out the buttons to larger and fancier buttons. You'll need to add more buttons on the wrist closure to keep it together. If you have that kind if time, this could be a decent dress. You will want to wear a Skims shirt slip under it too, to keep your underthings a secret and your body smooth from any pany lines. This is not a granny panty dress."
2.0,In the picture the fourth infantry division logo is a lot smaller so you can actually see all the details it’s in the picture but when I got it in the mail the fourth infantry division logo is as big as my head so when you put this on you really can’t tell what you’re looking at until you take it off so defeats the purpose of having the logo and the flag on here because you can’t tell what you’re looking at until you take it off and lay it out and I have a big head
2.0,"Beautiful, but broke very easily...only wore it once:("
2.0,Very small...<br />You can fit a cell phone and a wallet in it at the same time.<br />Disappointed 😞
2.0,THis is not at all what I expected I had to give it to my younger sibling because that how small it was and for nothing because it broke 3 days later
2.0,Sizing is alittle off
2.0,"It’s is see thru and unlined, so if you want to be risky and show what’s on or not underneath then go for it"
2.0,"I am disappointed in the actual ""small"" size of these earrings, they are to tiny for my liking."
2.0,"Ran extremely small, did not fit my 4 year old at all. Cute hat, but also arrived with a price raging it for several dollars less than I payed for it."
2.0,"They leak on the sides! The panties are too shallow/narrow in the crotch. With a tampon, they leaked when I was sleeping, and walking. The stains dont really wash off!! Disappointed:("
2.0,"Although it's light-weight and looks nice, it is not particularly comfortable due to its small nose-pad gap. Also, the biggest issue for me was that if you are not looking perfectly straight at the computer screen, even with slight angle to the left or right, the view became distorted! Therefore it was not practical for me and I had to return it."
2.0,Cute color but poor fit. The top was bulky for a small chest and the material seemed cheap
2.0,I ordered the US Medium which is what I normally wear but this shirt was much too big and baggy for my tastes.  I expected a more athletic fit.  The shirt did look well made but the sizing was off for my build.
2.0,I like the style but they broke literally the day I got them
2.0,"This was not what I thought I was getting.  The chain length was given, but not the size of the rings. THEY WERE HUGE.  It was very gaudy, I thought.  I was looking for small delicate rings on a short chain."
2.0,"The Christmas Red plush scarf for $11.99 is fantastic. High quality and “plush” - love it! I loved it so much I bought another one for my sister and a couple of the other colors (red/white/blue) and (purple/yellow) ones. While the Christmas Red one was high quality and fantastic, the other two were incredibly thin and cheap - not close to the quality of the Christmas Red one. I give the $11.99 version of the Christmas red scarf 5 stars, and the other two scarf colors 1 Star."
2.0,Could be so much better. Thin and on a rubber type band. I wore it a few days and then noticed it was getting all scratched up.
2.0,The earring post were bent.
2.0,"This dress was too small. I ordered a size 20/22 and received a size ""XL"", which makes me believe that the sizes are arbitrary and not accurate. It did not fit like a 20/22 as it was too small for me, an I usually wear an 18. It is also see through, especially on the chest so it isn't very well suited for women with larger busts. It also is extremely wrinkly fabric. The color was pretty and the length was as expected, but it just is not a good dress for someone with my body type (plus-size, large bust, large hips, hourglass shape). I returned the product due to the size."
2.0,"Its not for us wide noses people, it don't look legit I would recommend a slightly bigger size lol"
2.0,The padding does not cover the entire shelf bra and looks lumpy. I returned both.
2.0,Ok but 2 days after I retired this th By means nothing to me at all.. it just sits on a shelf…
2.0,Very hard to put on! Break easy.
2.0,It's coming a loose on it's own. I actually have to check through out the day that it doesn't come apart and then I lose the entire gear fit2.
2.0,"Positive...<br />-Really thick<br />-Design is amazing. I love it.<br /><br />Negative...<br />-The T-shirt is not 100% cotton but instead it's 50% cotton and a 50% polyester blend.<br />-T-shirt brand is Gildan, which is not the best in quality.<br />-The size doesn't quite feel like a large but more in between a medium and a large if that makes since. This is<br />due to the shirt brand.<br />- It gets hot wearing this shirt because of the polyester in it.<br />-Shirt feels rough and heavy.<br />- The design started to crack and peel after ONE wash in a Cold/Cold wash cycle and I decided to let it air dry after seeing those. You can see the peeling under the E in the word LASER.<br /><br />I really do like the design of the print but the quality of the shirt and print sucks. I think soon enough the design will start to peel even more."
2.0,"I ordered green per the picture but delivered was Navy. Upon further inspection, the description says Navy but the picture is not even close to a Navy, it was very green."
2.0,The dress was very pretty and fit perfectly. I bought a medium. Which i usually wear. I am 5'6 140lbs. 34D. I ended up returning it though because i didnt realize there was tule under the skirt. Its really scratchy at the seams across the belly on the inside even though there is a slip. I would have kept it if it didnt have the tule and i think it would of been much cuter without.
2.0,"This was my favorite of all the dresses I bought, and I really wanted it to work out. It has the SOFTEST lace I have ever felt on a dress like this. However, I am 5'1&#34; and the dress was too long on me (more tea length), and the sizing is way off. I got a size larger than what I normally wear (XXL instead of XL), and the dress would not zip up in the back. The lace on the neck was even in the perfect spot where it doesn't itch or tickle the spot under your chin. If you're looking to get this, I think a size large might fit in the XL or XXL, but anyone bigger may not fit."
2.0,Amazing design but once you wear them once it stretches out and the pattern never looks the same. Also the spandex is not good for warm days.
2.0,"it pinches your arch, gatbage"
2.0,Super comfy. My first pair is too small and I was about to buy more in every color the next size up but shipping is absurd. $4.99 PER PAIR. Not worth it.
2.0,I seemed that the ring guard would stay on the ring--for a longer time. It stays about as long as a band-aid. My mistake.
2.0,Arm broke off after 2 weeks and it's made of very brittle plastic. Won't buy again.
2.0,Way to small order 2 sizes up. Other than that looks as pictured
2.0,The ring is about the size of a nose ring if not smaller. The center ball doesn’t come out. Instead it bends in the middle like a clip on ring would. While it is very pretty it would be impossible to wear this as my bellybutton ring. It’s not at all what I thought I was ordering.
2.0,The bands are not loop bands therefore when you take them off the watch falls
2.0,Extremely smaller than expected . U can barely see the stud n my nose.
2.0,This suit runs extremely small. I ordered this 3 sizes bigger for my son who is usually a 32 and it was still too small.
2.0,I ordered a Medium. It is no Medium. It’s very large. I thought it might shrink after washing and drying and it did not shrink a bit. I would not buy this again. Not accurate at all in sizing
2.0,"Size ran small, didn't like fabric wo"
2.0,Runs large too bad when I went to exchange them the price went up! Just sending them back.
2.0,"Not flattering at all. Cheap material, top of skirt falls below natural waist making the dress weirdly baggy in the worst place. Skirt doesn't flare out at all so the shape of the dress is overall unfortunate. Not impressed."
2.0,The shirt is a completely different blue and isn't the same material as in the picture.  It is also shorter.  Disappointed with it.
2.0,The shoes look great and my toddler loved them but it's been a month and one of the shoes already stopped lighting up.
2.0,The earrings are very difficult to get out of your ears. It seems like the backs stick on them once their in your ear and can be painful to remove.
2.0,Runs small and is paper thin. What a way to rip people off.
2.0,Has really irritated my cartilage piercing in my upper ear.  Finally took it out today. Not so sure if it is really made of 316L stainless steel.
2.0,Very thin material. Afraid to wash.  Looks like it will fall apart
2.0,They don't stay up have to keep pulling up
2.0,What I received is not what I ordered. The pink is practically neon and not muted like in the picture and the sleeves are shorter than the length of the shirt.
2.0,Runs very small I wear a medium ordered a large fits verry sung. Material is also silky
2.0,"For it being a multi pack, I guess I expected them to all be the same. 3 of the 5 are fine but the other two,... My boobs fall out of one and the other, the straps were sewn on backwards making it not even wearable."
2.0,"I was really disappointed with these socks.  I would say I have average sized/proportional feet and I found these to be too tight around the toes.  Also, my big toes are the longest toes on my feet.  I found the fabric in the 4th and pinky toes to be too long.  They hang off the top of those toes.  It just looks weird.  Tight toe socks with extra fabric off the top.  I also noticed the anti-slip nubbies were falling off after only 1 wear.  Lastly, these are hand wash only and air dry.  Who has time to hand wash socks????<br /><br />They did arrive on time and thankfully I bought them on a lightning sale so I didn't spend too much but in the end, I just wish I didn't buy them at all.  I only wore 2 colors and I will be donating the other 2 pairs of socks.  Hopefully the next person will have a better experience than I did."
2.0,this color is not what it seems. The color i received is much darker and more green.
2.0,"I received the item after 6 days even though I am a Prime member. It would have been ok if the item I received was brand new. But looks like the item I received was an open box item, which was already used by somebody else. I will try to ask for a full refund and see how it goes."
2.0,"Was not sweatshirt material, material is too thin, colors faded, will not buy again"
2.0,The jacket is ok.The pants are very smal in waist.i am a 36 normaly and this where a 38 and was very hard to button up.But the keg was huge.It looked like clown pants.Overall to expensive to buy only for the jacket.Dissapointed.
2.0,Ummm..these are cute but I should have taken the time to read the reviews.  they are pretty but very tiny like for a child not an adult.  I think the picture makes it look much wider than she are they are very thin you can barely even see the stones. Extremely difficult to get them on.
2.0,Very cute but Miss Sized. Does not appear to be XXL but medium
2.0,Backs aren't tight enough to keep earrings on.
2.0,Shipping was fast. Ring came beautiful. I've been wearing the ring for maybe 2 weeks and the black on the band is rubbing off.
2.0,The description doesn't say that the design is only printed on one side of the fabric.<br />The other side of the bandana is plain.
2.0,"I like the lanyard, but it was sewn together incorrectly. I'm going to have to take it apart to fix it. sort of defeats the purpose of buying a ready made one since I could have gone to the fabric store, bought ribbon and the hardware and made this myself for less."
2.0,"This top was HUGE on me.  I ordered a small, and basically it would fit a woman who typically wears large-size T-shirts.  I swim in it, and the waistline falls down almost to my hips. (I'm 5'6&#34; so I'm not super short.)"
2.0,It had a mark on it from the print
2.0,"My wife purchased this dress and this is her review... &#34;I'm so sad that this didn't fit right. It was too big in the waist and bust, but I couldn't even get the sleeves past my biceps because the arm holes were so small. Weird. It was adorable, but made to fit someone with tiny arms the size of a wrist, apparently. I read other reviews that mentioned it was made too small in the arm area, but I took a chance anyway. I took my measurements and bought the correct size for what they said should fit me.  If this dress was made to fit better I would buy one in every color. Oh well.&#34;"
2.0,The chain is to small
2.0,The clips for the top bit came broken off. Boo.
2.0,"This wallet still won't fold, the credit card slots are too tight and I am not really happy with this purchase. I hope it loosens up over time, but I'm not impressed with this wallet."
2.0,"Was not nearly as small or as thick of a ring as advertised, very disappointing"
2.0,Fits weird in the boobs
2.0,comes apart after a couple washes
2.0,Odd shaped
2.0,Cute but has very strong chemical smell that I do not feel comfortable having on my baby
2.0,No es como lo anuncian
2.0,No I don't like at all to do big
2.0,Unfortunately they are see throughout very cheaply made. They fit fine but they can only be used for at home as like sleepers. Another negative is you can’t return to the seller with out paying a crap load of money. Just save your money and don’t buy or pay a little more somewhere else for better quality.
2.0,"I purchased C Green style, the dress was tight and didn’t have any give in the chest area. The fabric is bit stretchy at all.  The bottom of the dress is very large.  Don’t recommend"
2.0,"Cheap material, fragile. Returned it."
2.0,Super cute.<br />Beads started cracking and breaking off within a week.
2.0,It looks nice wish the gems were a little bigger they're super small and the piece itself is really small compared  to what I'm use to wearing.
2.0,Everything for the shoe was not bad except for the velvro that tightens the top of the shoe.  This result in the shoe being on too tight.
2.0,The cut of this shirt doesn't work for me. I am going to have to alter it. ...and I bought 2
2.0,Not as cute as they look.
2.0,"I have ordered from this seller in the past and was very pleased. This time there was a place at the neckline that was not sewn properly, there was a hole.  Therefore, I returned the item. I will order from this seller in the future and I may order this blouse again in hopes that it will be sewn properly"
2.0,"Hard to do anything but dig with these gloves on, try transplanting anything with long nails, impossible, kept having to remove one glove."
2.0,Didn't fit like the others from this seller at all. Way too small and impossible to put on and hook.
2.0,Shorts fit great. Put them on for the first time today and put my phone in my wallet in my pocket and my debit card fell right through due to a hole.
2.0,Color is brown.  I wanted reddish one.
2.0,A bit small for a man..
2.0,"Tangles fairly easily but less than I'd expect from three chains. Chains are a bit thicker than I would have liked. Triangle pedant often didn't hang straight. Chain snapped after &#60;10 wears. But what should I have expected, given the price?"
2.0,"It's fine. A weird line across the waist, and the fabric felt super cheap. Sent mine back."
2.0,"Not impressed with the fabric quality or the mis-matching patterns where the seams meet. Disappointed, the picture of the hat is very cute."
2.0,"Too small for my face, and came in the wrong color"
2.0,Clasp is difficult to use and was too small.
2.0,Nothing thermal about these.<br />100% polyester.<br />Waste of money unless you are joining the Bolshoi Ballet.
2.0,"First off the slit is way too revealing!!! It goes all the way up my cooch!! Ugh not cute, I have to safety pin it because it's so high up! You can see my underwear. Other than that it's a nice dress"
2.0,His nikes sneakers are 4 1/2 soccer cleats are 5's  I ordered a size 4 and they fall off his feet.  They run really big  I wont be able to comment on the wearability for a LONG time
2.0,Its super cute but has a ton of buttons. I wish it was a pullover shirt. It ran super small. I got a large and it looked like it should be a small. I a D size cup so the buttons gaped on me. Wish it would have worked out.
2.0,Poor fit and feel
2.0,"Bought it for my niece for Christmas but it seemed too cheap so I kept it.  Tried it once but didn't care for it, gave it to Goodwill."
2.0,"Even though most of the items I purchase are true to size, the chest was WAY too tight.  Rest of the dress was ok. Disappointed."
2.0,Fit was way off. Too short too narrow. Bought usual size for Saucony but these were nothing like their normal fit. It was as if they had been marked wrong. Purchased a 9 but they fit like an 8. Loved the style and color. Very disappointing.
2.0,Was nice but stopped working after 3 days
2.0,Recently purchased this bag and would not recommend it. While I love the look of the bag... it cannot hold up to anything. Unacceptable for a bag of this price.<br /><br />I have had the bag for a month and it already has two spots where the leather hasn't held up. I contacted the company and they blamed my &#34;wear and tear.&#34; I haven't asked that much of the bag.<br /><br />The company doesn't stand behind the product... and how could they?? Don't buy if you want something that is going to last without a tons of scuffs and scrapes.
2.0,I ordered two of these at the same time. One worked fine.  The other I could never get the time set on because two of the buttons were stuck.  Me and my husband both tried everything we could think of and never got it to work.  Very disappointing
2.0,Returned. I need a half-size smaller :(
2.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; 130lbs (33-27-38) bra size 32C/34B. I purchased a RED size small and it fits perfectly. I love the fit from the thighs up. Unfortunately I hate the color and the outfit. The color is not red. It's a hot pinkish-orange. The legs flare out on the bottom which is not what you want with a cropped pant leg. If the leg had been tapered, or even straight, it would have been an awesome outfit (despite the color). See pics."
2.0,The fit and comfort level are great. However they always look dirty in the front I’ve clean them and wash them and they just looked terrible and I haven’t had them that long. The shoes I had before that are the same brand and I had them for six years. I’m already ready to get a new pair after these
2.0,Mine came with mostky white flowers. More than expected. I was hoping for more vibrant color.
2.0,"As the title says, these are a great, lightweight and soft fabric however the drawstring fell out after 1 wash and after a couple of wears the seams are starting to rip and fray. They're true to size but I would not recommend purchasing. The price does not reflect the quality of these pants at all. I'm SUPER disappointed."
2.0,I got a defective one the dress was down in a place that it shouldn’t have been and did not look like the one that was pictured in the image because of it. But otherwise i really think it could have been cute to wear the quality of material was great.
2.0,"Most of them broke right away. A lot of them wouldn't fit around my neck. Out of the whole pack, I can wear 2"
2.0,I've had these a little over a month and some of them are already falling apart. My underwear that I have from Walmart has held up better than these.
2.0,"I bought these because I detest those yoga socks with the toes built in.  These, however, are probably good for walking, but not good for pilates.  The socks start slipping and  moving around and it defeats the grip purpose"
2.0,the material is cheap and looks like plastic. there are so many pumps underneath the surface. I don't recommend it.
2.0,"Last year I purchased the black and dark gray dresses and absolutely LOVED them!!! So naturally I ordered more for this summer. I just purchased the navy blue, the green, the red, and the purple. First off, I ordered size large in all of the dresses which you wouldn't guess by the picture of the 4 different lengths! The only one that is remotely close to the length of black and dark gray ones I ordered last year is the navy blue, the 3 others are SOOOO SHORT!! Secondly, make sure you double check the Rayon to Spandex percentage on EVERY color because the green one is only 90% Rayon and 10% Spandex where the other 3 are 95% Rayon and 5% Spandex and let me tell you that 5% Rayon makes a HUGE difference!!!!!!!! The green one feels like stiff cardboard and is not soft at all! I am pretty disappointed, I am 6'1"" and loved how long the black and gray ones were that I ordered previously, and now I get a bunch of short (for me) dresses this time around so I will be returning the 3 that are so short, and I will definitely be returning the green ""cardboard"" one."
2.0,These gloves came in a 3-pack.  One pair was two left-handed gloves.  Luckily I opened that one first or I would not have known for a while.  Open all the packs when you receive them and make sure you have a left and a right!
2.0,The blue is a slate blue. (Lighter blue) The picture it appears almost navy.
2.0,These earrings are very heavy. Pretty but heavy.
2.0,cute socks but not wide enough for my calves. seller did refund price of socks and didn't require me to return them. yay!!@
2.0,"This would’ve been a cute romper if it hadn’t come with a whole already in the seams. The rest of the stitching was done really poorly and it looked like it would probably have come undone sooner than later as well. Also, the clasp on the back was one of those small elastic loops to put a button through & it was detached on one side, aka useless. It fit pretty well except the waist line was baggy where it’s elastic. It went down to my ankles though."
2.0,Really large and fluffy. They don’t hang well and the stud is long and flimsy
2.0,"This wasn't really worth it.  It fit the ear awkwardly and is made of soft metal, so that it broke if too much force was used to reshape it.  Disappointing."
2.0,Low quality material.. arm too big
2.0,I had to immediately send this dress back. It looks lovely but I could not even try it on. It is NOT stretchy as I could not EXPAND it out to even put over my head!
2.0,"I loved the looks of this top and went by the size chart but must donate it.  A smaller lady will enjoy it!  Just so  you know, I wear a 36C bra and am a long tall Sally."
2.0,"My head is not genuinely enormous, but this one fits almost too snug. Other caps provide better coverage; this one has no extra room to luff on top.<br />The headband is fine, but it is a little scratchy. Comfort level 5/10. I have not worn it on long rides because it is unpleasant, so I cannot say if it would get better with time. Exercise fabrics never do, so I do not anticipate that it would. All in all, it is a fine hat with nothing to hate or really love about it.<br /><br />You get what you pay for; what did you expect?"
2.0,"I really love the onsie, and the headband is fine, too. the tutu, however, is TINY. I can't even put it on my daughter! Annoying that I have to look for another tutu now. Maybe they sent the wrong size? I'm not sure, but super frustrating to deal with."
2.0,Got mislead thinking i was ordering Kenkoh .....starps look weak and thin and size is smaller than expected does not fit the arch as expected
2.0,"The deer is nice , but the chain is way too small . I have to add links to the bracelet 😥 ."
2.0,The gauge is the correct size but the earrings themselves were a bit bigger than I expected and the diamond shaped ones were broken and the hoops were bent. I guess bad handling?  :(
2.0,"Nice looking earrings, but had to fix the post because it fell off and they are a bit heavy."
2.0,"This says compression, but my wife could barely put it on.  She is 6 feet tall and weighs 135lbs (she is very skinny) so medium is almost always the right fit.  Would not recommend due to sizing issues.  It was a nice looking shirt and made well."
2.0,"Strange cut - waste band and arm bands are very tight - I ordered an extra large because I wanted it to be oversized but it isn't... 5'7, 160. Pockets are really just folds that make it stick out strangely at the hips/waist. I'll be repurposing this one.."
2.0,Flimsy and won’t last. I bought for a gift but will not give as it is not a quality product. It’s a shame because the design of the rose is adorable.
2.0,"Bought the medium and it fits well. The only thing is on the first was DO NOT wash with anything else. I washed these and the color turned my laundry bags red, as you can see from the picture."
2.0,Didn't come close to my expectations......really disappointed jn this product.
2.0,"Width is good, however if you’re taller than 5’6” it’s way too short!"
2.0,"So I'm super bummed. Jacket is super cute.....but too small!!! I normally wear a Large, somethings an XL. I ordered a XXXL and if I move my arms, I'm sure the seems will rip open. Other reviews said order 2 sizes bigger...NOPE...order 3 sizes bigger. Trust me!!!! this jacket is TINY."
2.0,They did not look like picture advertisement. Yes purple but with bright white edging. Disappointed but still unique. I’m not a hater.
2.0,"This shirt is terrible quality and definitely not worth the ~$30 it's currently selling for. The collar is weirdly shaped and kind of wonky and while the fabric is lightweight and comfortable mine came with lots of loose threads and uneven stitching.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this shirt. You can find better designed shirts made out of similar fabric for a better price that *don't* have loose threads and a weird collar."
2.0,It's  so small you can hardly see it.  I gave it to my 4 ur old to play with.
2.0,I purchased the hat for an upcoming  vacation. Very nice hat and Loved the mesh material for warmer weather. Unfortunately  the Velcro on the back traps the hair. I used a Scissor to cut my hair off the Velcro. Deal breaker so I return it.
2.0,Fit very tight. Hard to pull on. Feel very cheaply made.
2.0,Does not look like picture short in length but fat wide
2.0,This ring is paper thin and fragile looking. It looks nice but disappointed in the quality. There is almost no edge to the ring like the photo shows. May return them.
2.0,"I think it would be beneficial to have some instructions on how to do the wrapping of the legs because no matter what I do I can never get it to look the way it does in the picture. AND i do mean how to wrap a leg properly to maje it look good...and no i am not a big girl with big legs. I am a petite size 2-4 depending on manufacturer.  The more expensive the clothes, the smaller the size"
2.0,Two stars because it’s a very nice shirt. But it’s very very small.
2.0,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas 2022 and it already will not turn on (Feb 2023). She didn’t drop or get water on it. Went to charge it and when we went back to get it the screen would not turn on. Very sad daughter. Only had it for a few months,"
2.0,Too big and much too long for a little girl.
2.0,"So I used these in the office, they worked well at first. They are very tight on my head after about an hour I would get a headache. Unfortunately The band broke right in the middle around September so that's only 9 months of use.  As cute as they are I can't seeing myself replacing them, just creating to much waste."
2.0,"I paid $23 for this bra, the $13 price tag was still attached. At least remember take it off next time."
2.0,They need to be smaller
2.0,"They're so comfy, but be forewarned: if you plan on using these for running purposes, look elsewhere. I knew for the price they were probably a risk, but wanted to give em a shot anyway. I ran one 10K in my first pair, brand new out of the box. By race end, they were torn through."
2.0,They did not look like the photo. They do not have a complete connection and are open with a small rubber backing
2.0,It's clear glass. Looks like the back was painted with a brush  with red and blue paint.
2.0,It looks so awesome on my ear but there wasn't much room for the top part to grip my ear so it kept falling off and swinging from my earlobe .
2.0,"Iove the bracelet, but it's very difficult to clasp by yourself.  Cheaply made.  I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Very disapointed how wrinkled and mushed up it came in as
2.0,"I ordered a large in black. This set is very low quality overall, this material is see through, hard and has the look of a toddlers jog set. My jacket fits as expected, shoulder slots aren’t very noticeable in my opinion and that the most attractive feature for me. My jacket has a hole in the pocket, strings hanging off everywhere and the zippers are plastic LOL. The pants fit too big & too long on me I usually wear small in jog pants but with these sets I have to order up for Asian sizes and larger breast. Pants don’t have a fitted style like picture and the plastic zippers have an odd space or gap at bottom. If you like the polyester feel then this would work for you but it’s too thin and hard for my taste, not worth $30. Giving 2 stars because it looks as pictured mostly but the fabric appears thick in their photos. Returning ASAP"
2.0,Costume prop for my daughter at Halloween. Worked well for the night but it was pricey for what it was for.
2.0,The Model looked fabulous wearing this blouse; I did not! Fabric was scratchy and the blouse did not look like a quality piece.  Nothing wrong with the size and it was not misrepresented; it just did not look good.
2.0,Don't like....doesn't fit.  Too long.
2.0,Cute mask but the valves came out within a few weeks of wear.
2.0,"These are really comfortable, they are Not hard on the feet, so its not hard on your legs. I normally don't like anything memory foam but these are easier on my feet than allot of the more expensive slippers with the rubber soles. I wrote a different review when I purchased these, I've had to change it because I bought 2 pair and both lasted maybe a few months. The memory foam is Not real memory foam, it's just foam that takes the shape of your heel and eventually your heel sits in a hole it forms from walking on it. These are cheaply made and I thought they would be warm, well, they are not. My toes are freezing and I am usually always hot and hate for my feet to be too hot. Nope, not these. Toes are always cold. I miss the neighborhood Payless shoes. They always had the best slippers. I'm striking out on Amazon with slippers so I'm going to shop elsewhere. There are too many sellers from overseas on here now and even the Jessica Simpson slippers have terrible reviews and videos showing them falling apart after a few days! Read Allot of the reviews before you buy. There are so many more reviews on these products as of late because it's really infuriating spending all this money on shoes or slippers and they end up being garbage! Amazon needs to do better at filtering out these cheap sellers with terrible products! These slippers are Not worth the money. Save it and buy them elsewhere period. I've literally gone through about 7 pairs of slippers from Amazon this year! I'm going to buy from a store, even if online, it's going to be from a trusted store."
2.0,"These boots were nice while they lasted. I put a pair of old shoes inside of them, just to make it easier to slip on and off. After a few months, cracks started developing at stress points created by the motion of walking. Now the boots are definitely not waterproof. I'd be better off not wearing boots now."
2.0,"Cute bag, but I had it less than a month and one river broke through and the threading started coming loose."
2.0,"Most of the time, the socks just slip right off 2 steps into wearing them or just trying to get my shoes on, but every once in a while, they'll stay. Seems like it depends on the shoe. Like it has to be a tight shoe that barely fits so that the socks have no room to move and fall off."
2.0,Changes quickly
2.0,"Loved the size of these. However, they were described as having an end ball (even said so on the shipping wrapper) but definitely didn’t have one."
2.0,To small difficulty wearing
2.0,This ran more than a size too small. I would size up 2 sizes.
2.0,These are really flimsy and nearly impossible to get in. Don't recommend.
2.0,"Material was weird and shiny, I returned"
2.0,"I normally wear a Medium in a compression shirt, liking it to fit tightly.  This Medium did not fit tightly at all, so I sent it back for a Small.  The small was still too big.  I kept the shirt, but am not particularly happy with it."
2.0,Does not look like the picture when wearing. It stuck of vinegar through the first 3 wash cycles.
2.0,This shirt is not what I expected. It is not off the shoulder and its not long enough to wear with leggings either. I also thought I was getting Khaki color but this is more a light mustardish yellow.
2.0,Cute and fits well but way to sheer to wear as a dress. Perfect for a coverup
2.0,"The bows are really cute and good quality BUT two of the hair ties are breaking already, barely holding on."
2.0,"Super Small and Short, I am only 5'4 and it did not work out with this dress!"
2.0,"This product has no zippers or buttons to allow a person with boobs or hips to actually put on the dress. I could get it partially up my hips or partially over my boobs but neither was flattering and it certainly did not fit correctly. With this being a formfitting dress, it needs someway to unzip or unbutton to be able to properly fit into the dress."
2.0,It was made wear ir wouldn't stay up on my ear.
2.0,Cheap material and cheaply made pattern. Not worth the money. Chinese quality (not a good thing)
2.0,"It’s a pretty necklace. That’s the only good thing I have to say about it. As soon as I opened the plastic bag it came in, one of faux pearl rolled out of the bag. Yes, I know it’s fake pearls, but even for costume jewelry, it’s bad. It’s very flimsy. I don’t see this surviving one or two wears. You’re better off going to a department store and waiting for a sale. At $10.99, I actually think I over paid."
2.0,One off them came broken
2.0,Way too big. Did not look anything like what I received.
2.0,Not good quality at all. Fits too tight in legs and too long. Cheap
2.0,Thinking it was a jacket<br />More like a sweater
2.0,The pockets are set back to far to have your hands in them and be comfortable.
2.0,"I wish it worked for me... it seems cute. But the shoulders padding are weird, i wish there was any, they are on the top of the jsckets at a weird angle. And the holes for the arms is to small. So tight. But after that it was cute"
2.0,Shipped wrong size twice.  I have ordered 3 pairs now with 2/3 being the wrong size. Springs need some breaking in but fit well and do the job well.
2.0,Granddaughter wasn't impressed.
2.0,lace fell apart first time it was washed 😞
2.0,"So the plug shape and size fits fine, but they don’t feel like my previous glass plugs. Maybe it just feels different or it might be not glass.<br /><br />The swirl pattern is fine but the colors aren’t nearly as vibrant as shown. Maybe they look that good under professional photo lighting, but I’m guessing the colors in the display photos were enhanced in some way."
2.0,"I love this wallet, but they need to spend the money for a metal clasp instead of a plastic one. I've only had this for one week and the clip has already broken so it won't stay closed now. Disappointed. :/ The rest of the design is great though."
2.0,I am a size medium so I purchased a large.  Couldn't even get my arm in it...more like an extra small!
2.0,Fabric is looks different than the image on their description. The quality is not worth the price!
2.0,"This dress did not meet my expectations.  The neckline on the dress I received looks like a regular banded t-shirt, it doesn't look like the picture.  The material is cheap, scratchy, and thin.  And it is SHORT.  I am only 5'4&#34;, but this is a leggings-only kind of dress on me - if you are tall, this will hardly even cover your booty.  I will say it fit true to size, I bought my normal medium, and I would say it fit like it was supposed to.  The arms are nicely snug, and it fits in the chest, but it is just so flowy, it looked like I was wearing a smock."
2.0,This has turned out to be very stiff and uncomfortable to wear. It did not turn out as expected. It's also an odd length rectangle.
2.0,I’ve work twice and won’t wear again it snags everything I wear even tore and 100 sweater. Very disappointed wish I could return
2.0,Don't waste your money! You can find a better umbrella at Target. When I opened it for the first time it fell like it's going to break on me. It was not sturdy nor well made. The design inside was cute that's about it. I returned it right the way.
2.0,Nice hot summer fabric but fit is extremely small especially for a &#34;loose&#34; fit. model must be size negative zero
2.0,"The item looks much more delicate on line, it's a bit chunky, my teenage daughter wanted it, I as an adult would never wear it, super cheap looking"
2.0,The product says one size fits all and it doesn’t. I am a c cup and there was no stretch in the cups so it was way too small.
2.0,"Very baggy material. From the picture it looks like it would be silky, but that was not the case at all. Needs a different kind of fabric to be better."
2.0,I received the product with two holes.
2.0,Not at all what I expected. The design work is very tiny next to the ball cap.
2.0,The hat was very small<br />We had to rerun it
2.0,If I had known how tiny this would be I wouldn’t pay more than $3 for it. Fell for the old photo trick where they zoom in to make the product much larger than life. Geeze.
2.0,It gross material. I sent mine right back.
2.0,I felt so let down well I waited & waited & my package came.well I went right away 2 try it on & it was town .
2.0,They were too small and the button hole wasn't there... like they forgot or something. I returned them and got a refund. They might have been cute though??
2.0,Cute top but it’s MUCH shorter than pictured. When I raise my arms - my mid section is exposed. Bummer!
2.0,I love the color of this wallet in person and I was excited to get rid of the plain black wallet that I had been using. The wallet does easily hold all of my cards and papers but I’m having issues with the quality of the wallet. I haven’t stuffed it with a lot of items and it’s super easy to close but part of the material for the zipper is already disconnected from the wallet and I can see the inside of it. Not happy after having it less than a month.
2.0,Material ended up being a little costume-like. Did not enjoy wearing it
2.0,"it's cute, but it broke before i even left the house :/"
2.0,They were too clunky and narrow (and I have narrow feet!). Not exactly what I wanted for walking around a festival all day.
2.0,I didn't likr it
2.0,"The picture shows that the strap is the leather material but when I received mine in the mail, the strap was a woven nylon. Not cute and looked so cheap."
2.0,"It is advertised as having a mesh insert, so I assumed I was getting shorts with a mesh liner.  However there was absolutely no mesh in the product,  As a result I will not be buying this product again."
2.0,It cause a skin irritation on both ears upon arrival.  The ear straps feel like paper.
2.0,I owned & wore a puka shell necklace throughout the 70's and 80's.  Loved it!  Just recently I gave that same necklace to my daughter because it was too small on my neck these days.  I bought this one hoping to replace it.  No chance.<br /> The shells are huge and the necklace is heavy.  Neither of which are appealing to a woman.  My old necklace had slight variations of an ivory white with just a few specklings of light brown.  This is very white.  I believe they are actual puka shells based upon the telltale swirl on the inside of the shell but they are shells on steroids.  Maybe my grandson would like them.  I don't.
2.0,"I do'nt normally post reviews but, this requires something.<br /><br />Literally, I unzipped the bag, put a suit + 2 shirts. zipped up the middle and when I went to zip the bag closed, both zippers broke off the plastic track. If the zippers stayed on, I would have given 5 stars easily. The price point would have been perfect. However, I'm quite disappointed."
2.0,The rubber part on these straps do not hold the eye glasses end very well.  These do not work as well as they should.
2.0,"These masks vary in quality within the same package of 50.  Some are completely missing the metal strip to fit over the nose bridge (top mask in photo), some have one strip and seem fine (middle), and other have two strips in which one often is sticking out of the side and pokes you in the face (bottom).  I would not purchase these again."
2.0,Too small!! AND THEY ROLL DOWN.
2.0,The right side pocket was folded over and is sewn into the side seam. I would have returned it except I missed the defect before I washed it. Otherwise they are very smooth and comfortable.
2.0,This did not fit well
2.0,Too boxy. Not flattering. If you have a large bust do not purchase.
2.0,Was very cute until they stopped working 4 weeks in.  They are at bed bath and beyond cheaper and no shipping costs. We paid way to much.
2.0,"The hat is similar and pretty to what is pictured but I'm disappointed with what arrived. The flower is much smaller than what the picture shows, by at least 1 1/2 inches in diameter. The petals too are not laying like flower petals and since its crocheted the petals are stuck where they are, you can't iron the petals down to lay nicely to look like a flower, it will just go back into place. Lastly, the shade of pink is more what I'd describe as &#34;in your face hot pink&#34; and not the pretty medium warm shade of pink as pictured. All in all I am still giving it as a gift but am disappointed with what I received. I chose this hat specifically for the big size of the flower and color of the flower and unfortunately did not receive what is pictured."
2.0,this necklace is very cheap with small defects here and there. It's considered a toy for my little niece. Don't buy this for your girlfriend to she will be mad.
2.0,I can't get them to stay on. Not satisfied at all.
2.0,the material is transparent and the bottom was sewn a bit crooked.
2.0,"Colors are exactly what I expected, but the torso runs short. My daughter's tummy up to her belly button is exposed."
2.0,I received this as a gift for Valentine's Day.  It is beautiful and I have received lots of compliments on it but one of the CZ stones has already fallen out.
2.0,"love the material but it was too small, 2x is my size (and even big on me) but this was too small"
2.0,"It was such a cute and fun dress. I wore it for senior pictures and it was perfect. However, the first time I washed the dress it ripped almost in half."
2.0,"These socks are really nice but what you are not told is that they are compression socks. My niece is about 5’1 103 lbs and these were squeezing the life out of her legs. She can’t wear them, which is very disappointing because she absolutely adores Jack Skellington."
2.0,Decent I look good in them but look like a cheap forever 21 glasses that's all & fv21 Does have this.  Not worth waiting all that time
2.0,The material leave blisters on the top of my feet.
2.0,I am personally giving it only two stars because the pointed sleeves are so obvious that I feel like Cruella DeVille with her pointed shoulders I don't know why my particular one is more prominent than any other picture I've seen of anybody else wearing the shirt
2.0,Runs very small. It doesn’t have any stretch so seems even smaller
2.0,"They are super cute, if only they were functional!  The bar that goes through your ear, is not the normal size of an earring backing.  My ear piercings got incredibly sore and its been 3 days since I wore them last.  I tried them twice just to see if my ear would get used to them, no luck.  I don't recommend these, but if they can change the backing, that would be incredible!  They would be great then."
2.0,"Neckline is uncomfortable and higher than pictured. Had to return, not a comfortable fit."
2.0,It's flimsy and not cute.
2.0,I'm 5'4 and this dress is way too long. I can't even wear it . It drags on the floor. If your 6 foot plus or know how to sew ... get this dress.
2.0,purchased for outdoor working but looked at so many and missed that these require plugging in ... that doesn't make them mobile for working but may work for some outdoor activities where I can rig up a plug in.
2.0,"I already owned a pair of anti glar/ computer readers so these were purchased as a second pair.  Since the price was far less than what I paid for a previous pair, decided to purchase them. Very disappointed in that there is no comparison as these do not appear to be anti glare glare. The work well as regular reading glasses. Not worth the trouble of returning."
2.0,"I use this for my cell phone, what I don't like the thing is the waist strap. It releases itself everytime. So, I can't wear this fanny bag on my waist. I totally disappoint why I bought this lol."
2.0,"The ring wasn't the best quality, and I would have given it a nicer rating if the stone hadn't been set in what looked like hot glue that spilled around the edges of the stone."
2.0,"The belt looked good, but it started having parts peel off after a month and with a few months started looking pretty nasty. I wouldn't recommend for daily wear - I'm pretty disappointed."
2.0,"Not great fabric, very see-through for a black sweater, and I guess unless you are super skinny, it won't look loose and comfy like the photo. I'm usually M size and got the XL just to make sure it was loose and it fit just barely larger than a Medium would look and feel on me. I'm guessing they put the XXL on the skinny model because the sweaters look like they are practically falling off of her."
2.0,"The description said hook and loop but it wears a snap neck closure. Material was great though, that’s why I gave it 2 stars!!"
2.0,They rings broke when I put them on I was trying to tight them a little bit the  peace of it broke off.
2.0,The product is a little shabby. Unable to fit the thumb in the thumb area as the internal material is poor.
2.0,Bad iron-on print.
2.0,This is NOT a Slim Fit as described. Don't buy if you really need a Slim fit turtleneck.
2.0,"I bought these goggles for my 10 year old son to use in his swimming lessons. He’s in the pool three times a week, but even though he is careful with them, the goggles didn’t even last a couple of months of use; A part of the plastic in the hook mechanism broke off and even though the two parts latch because of the magnet, it comes undone because the connecting piece is broken. This was the second time I bought these goggles because my son loved it so much but he lost the first pair."
2.0,Esta muy bonito.  Pero lamentablemente no jala bien  Se atrasa mucho la  hora. Mila da bien 😔😔😔
2.0,I usually don’t expect much quality out of basic tees. This fits nice but it’s fraying damn near everywhere. Also the sleeves don’t go halfway down the arm like they do in the picture.
2.0,This color is awkward...like a purplish blue
2.0,I knew this was not going to be a high quality watch and simply wanted something basic to wear while working out side.  I was concerned about the fit and made sure to review the specs however when I received the watches (ordered 2) they band was definitely smaller then indicated.
2.0,"The side came off after 6 months.  Never had that happen, even with inexpensive cases.  I'm careful with my phone so I think it was a defect or just a bad product."
2.0,does not fit as shown in the picture.
2.0,Much smaller than expected. It will only hold my wallet.
2.0,Not what u see on the picture
2.0,Dose not look just like some time a fake children chain wasn't very good didn't stay together very long look like children's costume jewelry
2.0,Comfy material but does not stay on your face and the filter does not stay in place.  Continues to fall out of its pocket.
2.0,Unfortunately it broke within a week of me having it and I thought I lost my badge. It’s very pretty but the pendant fell off. I love the actual chain.
2.0,"It's beautiful, but not functional. barely holds my Iphone and my very slim wallet.  Does NOT also hold my keys.  I wouldn't buy it again unless it was able to hold those three items."
2.0,"They nice looking , soft to ware, but they are missing the flat heels at all. I needed to pay for put a flat heels, but they ale come in a bigger size than what is supposed."
2.0,"Was too big for my wrist.  I'm a size 0 or so in clothes, and it was way too big for just 3 times around like the picture shows, and too short to wrap it 4 times around.  So if you have tiny wrists like me, I would say don't buy.  If you have normal sized wrists should be fine.  It looked cute, but just didn't work for me."
2.0,Its really cute but way bigger then expected
2.0,"They will not stay where they are suppose to, They don't fit."
2.0,I didn’t like was a metallic pink and it gave me look puffy at the abdominal area.
2.0,Side rip as I put it on cheap material poor quality not sew stong
2.0,Was wayyy too small. Choked my neck and only reached down to my breast... I'm 5'5 135lbs so I was kind of disappointed
2.0,"My ring broke after about 2 weeks of wear, but it was pretty while it lasted!"
2.0,Questionable quality.
2.0,It’s very pretty BUT NOT copper!!! More gold looking! Sadly!
2.0,Overall the gloves fit as expected ( I wear an XL due to fairly long fingers and thumb). The leather was thinner than I'd hoped and the cashmere lining was comfortable but not really all that warm. The deal breaker was finding a tear along the vent on the left glove after the first time I wore them out. I know I didn't receive them that way nor did I tug on them inordinately hard so I sent them back to Amazon. Quick refund and now I'm back here looking for a different pair.
2.0,No directions included.  Seem to have to move battery to get it to turn on or turn off.  Not impressive at all.
2.0,Some of the black painted metal was already rubbed off when received.
2.0,"I liked them, but when i tried to open it, the clasp broke! Really cute, but flimsy."
2.0,"The color looks great but the material is too slippery hard to get a grip. I had one made of canvas not nylon, which was much more sturdy and hold tight position."
2.0,You get what you pay for. These pants wear out in the first week of wearing them.
2.0,Cute dress but the yellow of the top and the yellow in the skirt are not even close to matching. Sadly this is being returned.
2.0,"It's nice, just a little small!"
2.0,"I purchased the WEESO Women's Sweatshirt Quarter Zip Pullover based on the photograph and description of it as a sweatshirt.  It's actually rather thin, made of a relatively lightweight fabric.  I wanted a warmer shirt for winter.  If that had been the only issue, I probably would have kept it. However, it was also shapeless, with a wide, almost boat-shaped, loose neckline. In the photo, it appears that the top could be zipped up for a close fit around the neck.  I'm 5'7,"" 180 lbs and bought the XXL.  It was oversized on me.  It's a decent garment, just not what I wanted, so I'm returning it."
2.0,I'm probably going to use the material to make something else.
2.0,"I like the color and feel of cover.  The most negative thing is the placement of the pen holder (in the middle) which made that side unusable.  Instead of returning, because I needed a new cover, I cut the holder off.  I should have payed closer attention to the picture."
2.0,The top is weird. I couldn't find any strap adjustment to make this work. The bust area is cut too short. No support.
2.0,Wanted to love this but it is huge. The sizing is way off on it. I got a medium and went a size smaller than recommended and it was still too big. Went to order a small and they don't have that style in small dangit!
2.0,Not what I expected. I’m returning as well.
2.0,Very dark lenses and won't stay on my head.
2.0,Fit is great.  Style is cute.  Color ran and bled into other clothes even after 2 washes and a week in the ocean and pool.
2.0,"Is short on me even though I am only 5'6, and the material is not soft for a swim suit... I missed my chance to return it so I am trying to give it away"
2.0,"The shape of these glasses cause them to work only in the hand of the actor, not on the face."
2.0,Item too small. Shorts showing underneath skirt. Just area to small for larger chested women.
2.0,"Indian jewelry is usually quite charming, but this is an Americanized version that looks cheap and needed to be returned."
2.0,way too small... sizes are incorrect. I ordered the largest size for my average 6 year old and I swear it would have barely fit my 3 year old niece. i had to return it which was disappointing because it was so cute and my daughter loves all things princesses.
2.0,too thin and stretches out
2.0,"Thought I'd really like this, but the sizes felt awkward and the long strap felt too wide. I returned it."
2.0,Very cute but way too thin. Even with a petticoat this dress is just not made well
2.0,"I looooooved this belly ring but after having it for a week, the sun broke off and I can not fix it."
2.0,Like the style.
2.0,"While the quality of this ring seems decent, it is only one ring that you receive. Not a set as pictured. Also, the ring size fits a little small. If you're a half size and can't get half sizes in this ring, go UP to the nearest size. The gold colour is also a very bright yellow. Makes it seem a little fake but overall it's ok."
2.0,"They are very comfortable but the length in the toe area is way too long. It's odd cuz they fit my heal area perfect but go past my toes 2 inches.. I'm trying to sort out if I can actually trim them. If they weren't too long, they'd be perfect."
2.0,i bought this legging because i loved the design. when i tried it on it felt ok. but when i put it to work out and starts sweating. it feels sticky and feels like it doesn't let my skin breath. and i really dislike that feeling.
2.0,Runs very small! Size up a couple of sizes.
2.0,I usually wear a small but ordered a medium and it was still too small. I am 5'8'' and weigh 125 lbs. I washed in cold water and let air dry and it still SHRUNK.
2.0,"The slipper socks are beautiful and fit nicely on my feet.  However, the little non-skid pads on the bottom are large, and if you are walking on anything but carpet, they dig into your feet.  These also shed uncontrollably, even after a wash.  Had to return them."
2.0,Did I get a mislabeled dress!? The reviews say it TTS. There is no way. I ordered the XL and it looks like I'll toddler maxi dress. My friend is a size 6-8 & she couldn't even button it and the length was just under her bootie! She's around 5'4. Super cute but sizing was waaaaaay off.
2.0,Not a pictured. I didn't like the way it fit me looks cheap.  Just ok
2.0,stylish on the outside but so uncomfortable. cheaply made.
2.0,"These were great and started out working really well. After the first wash (in a bag, delicate cycle, hung up to dry), they started to unravel at the open toe section. My black ones are still going good, but these guys didn't last."
2.0,"This dress just didn't fit right.  Too loose, and the sleeves too wide and long. I returned it shortly after it arrived."
2.0,Misleading sizes
2.0,Very nice I ordered size up still way to small so upset
2.0,"Their sizing chart is grossly incorrect.  I measured my hand, Size 9.  I have bought a lot of gloves according to size and this is generally a medium.  However, the sizing chart said I needed a size large, which is too big. Not happy."
2.0,So I got these to go with my skeleton costume but I wasn't able to wear them because one size does not fit all. They were very loose and kept sliding off.
2.0,Quality was cheap and not what pictures looked like. It was cute though!
2.0,Looks nice but need more stability.
2.0,This is not worth the $26 I spent on it. Zipper is as cheap as possible. There already seemed to be a bit of pilling just from the friction of being folded up.  I wouldn't guess the zipper would last more than 10 wears  Plenty of higher quality hoodies on sale or clearance for $15-$20 more than this one.
2.0,"The earrings are beautiful but the two sides are unbalanced. This causes the larger, heavier side to droop down. Unattractive. I returned them."
2.0,Not for me. Very see through.
2.0,"I’m 5’7” and the color is a very dark green, almost black so I returned it"
2.0,Fits really small...love the color though.
2.0,"Does not look like the shirt pictured. The color is different and the tie twirl part on the bottom is weird and it’s it all puffy. The shirt was actually a super comfy material, but don’t like how it lays and not what i was expecting color wise!"
2.0,Makes you want to go cross eyed. The polarization isn’t right or the curve of the glasses. If you look through only one eye it’s fine but with both open it’s jarring. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they look good.
2.0,They have zero stretch and are way too tight for her to wear.<br />The quality of denim is good.<br /><br />Others have said to size up which my wife did.<br />My wife wears a 16-17 and got a 2xl which is an 18-20 but she said it fits more like a 14.
2.0,"In all of the photos, it is of a black chain and black arrowhead. I recieved silver. It hardly glows in the dark."
2.0,Didnt fit like picture
2.0,I wanted to like this but just wasn’t for me
2.0,They are smaller than the sizing
2.0,came broken n looked nothing like the colors in the photo. when i opened up the package it got everywhere and it's glitter so it was hard to get off my dresser. but if i ever wanted a highlighter all i have to do is touch the pallet the outside of the pallet! if you're going to sell products like this you should put in between bubble wrap.
2.0,Not near as pretty in person. The colors are very bright not muted like the picture. A little big too.
2.0,"I was really happy to see all the positive review on this mask and decided to give it a shot. The mask is great, I just ordered a 3 pack and got only one mask?"
2.0,The under skirt ripped at the seam after 1 use because that material is thin and low quality.
2.0,This doesn’t really look like the picture. I don’t know how they got it perfectly round. When I tried it on it covered my whole face.
2.0,the hooks was not attached on 5 of 10
2.0,Beautiful and shipped fast but the jewelry tugged on my fiancé’s nipple so she ended up not being able to wear it. Also snags on things easily which is understandable considering the design.
2.0,I wore this a few times and got tons of compliments. Then I went to put it on one day and the buckle broke off the leather. I wore it pretty loose so I’m not sure how it did this. I made sure not to get it wet or anything. Cheap crap. Very disappointed.
2.0,I sized myself and bought size by sizing chart and was too large
2.0,"they looked really nice, but whenever my mom scratches her nose it leaves black behind. We first noticed it when she looked like she had a bruise on her forehead, and she couldn't remember bumping herself. She tried washing it off and after some scrubbing it did wash away. An hour later when she want shopping, she came home and hand the same black mark on her nose. I decided to test her gloves and sure enough, I was able to rub black smudges on my face. We hoped it would wear off after a while... and so far it hasn't. Have never had a pair of true leather gloves do that. I wanted to return them, but my mom said no... she'll just keep wearing them and hopefully the smudging will stop."
2.0,"To big for me, they dont fit my head."
2.0,"Had to send it back, way too small.  Would've loved to have kept it..."
2.0,Neckline is super large in comparison to the overall shirt.  Lots of shrinkage as well.  Not a good buy even for price as it’s going in the donate box!
2.0,Nice looking dress but a little too short for me (5’9”) and super thin And clingy material.
2.0,Demasiado de ajustada.
2.0,Very Small... not the size shown on picture of woman.
2.0,I usually wear 2XL but I wanted this to be kinda baggier. It clings to every roll!! I am so disappointed!
2.0,"Decent design and color, sizing a bit on the small side.  Quality pretty cheap, but worth it for $10-15 range."
2.0,"It was a shiny and thin material, not what I expected."
2.0,"It was odd. The first one I bought for my wife was very nice. She left it in a hotel ""HI express"" in Texas.<br />Gone for good. I bought her a new one and the cloth that it was mad of was not of the same quality.<br />Very poor and the size did not reflect as advertised."
2.0,I ordered a small cause im like 5'1 and 115 and its huge on me. I thought maybe washing it would help...but nope.
2.0,I really wish I liked this product. The band was not the size as advertised and the girls bounced like CRAZY. Sending this one back asap.
2.0,"Seems to be made of durable materials, however, there are ink marks where the seamstress should have attached the skirt. Definitely have some quality control issues and wish I had viewed other customers photos...it doesn't appear to be an isolated event. Will be returning..."
2.0,Short chain barley goes around the neck and rubbed off finish in one day of wear..
2.0,It's a very cute shirt but low quality
2.0,"Looks nothing like what's pictured,  the bottom has elastic so it's not a free flowing shirt, the color I got  was supposed to be blue but it looks like a dark violet.  I think it would fit better without the elastic at the bottom."
2.0,Too large for Medium
2.0,"chinese sizes.  I am a huge grown hormone fed American so my body is huge ..legs, glutes etc..this  underwear is way too small no me and presses down the family jewels so much it feels uncomfortable.  I now just using it as a sling shot to keep lizards off my patio."
2.0,"It wasn't what I expected.  It's a lot thicker than what I thought and it doesnt really fit around my arm correctly.  When trying to adjust it, specs of the paint/grey texture come off like aluminum foil"
2.0,Love rompers. This one makes you look frumpy. And the material was like burlap bags. The whole romper itself seemed to run large. But the elastic bands on the forearm were way to tight!
2.0,"Honestly this is just plain horrible.  The material is meant for a costume, I would compare it to the clothes you wear for dance recitals.  Incredibally itchy. The sleeves are elastic and hanging on by a string.  They are SOOO tight that they cut off your circulation.  I cut off the sleeves and the rest of the romper does fit properly, but it is just so cheap I don't know if I can ever actually wear it out."
2.0,it was so small that my poor child had to walk barefoot outside and she had small cuts on her foot
2.0,These shoes were great until they completely fell apart after 6 weeks. The upper completely disconnected from the sole.
2.0,Not as well shaped as the picture.
2.0,"They are OK,  I wanted them to be better......  My son likes wearing these water shoes, but I don't think the sole is think enough to protect his feet from anything sharp.  They fit fine (not too big) but they easily come off, so my son doesn't keep them on for a long time.  He wears when we get to the beach, then once he goes in the water and water shoes come off, then he wouldn't want to put them back on....  Looks cute though."
2.0,"Well, they were bigger than i thought they would be and HEAVY! Wore them for about an hour had to take them out because they were hurting my ears. Style was right just too heavy"
2.0,It arrived late because it was lost in mail. I loved the way it looked. Put it on at once.  Picture literally fell out of frame 2 days later.
2.0,These masks are pretty but even when adjusting the ear straps as tight as possible (scrunching your ears in the process) there are gaps around the nose. They seem far too thin to be very effective.
2.0,"Not as shown.  The sweater overall is big enough, but the neck is not oversized and I can't achieve the desired style. It just has a slightly larger crew neck, essentially.  I ordered the largest size, so not sure how anyone gets this down one shoulder.  I have lots of off-shoulder sweaters and this is not like them. There is also a strip of black yarn fringe down the center back which I did not expect.  Cotton yarn is soft, but I will hand wash and dry flat as I am guessing it will not survive machine agitation or the dryer. OK as a regular sweater, but not what I wanted."
2.0,I just don't get these. I want them to work but everything just doesn't fit. Do you put in the frank and then the beans? The tie seams useless as it only goes through those two holes. I'm no long dong silver but damn. Give a brotha some room.
2.0,If you have bigger shoulders and bust get an xl. The large couldn’t zip all the way for my wife around the middle of her back.
2.0,made of cheap plastic but beautiful braclet
2.0,some or the rings are very narrow.
2.0,Not reflective
2.0,small on the true size....:(
2.0,The dial broke after 2 months of wearing it.. seriously disappointed
2.0,I had to order up a size for my toddler and he doesn’t have wide feet.
2.0,"It has a back band adjuster that allow it to expand  ( kind of . . . )  to a larger head but it does NOT really fit-fit.  If I had an ~ 7 inch head then this hat would be functional and feel nice, but I have an ~ 7 and three quarters inch head, so this hat fits poorly.  It feels like a smallish hat.  It feels like a hat made for a teenager.  Me and my big head need to keep looking . . ."
2.0,This shirt was worn once and after washing the snaps won't snap together and hold.  It's just hanging in the closet waiting for me to figure out how to fix it.
2.0,"Awkward fit, doesn’t lay right at armpits or shoulders. Felt tight on chest then loose around mid waist. Might be cute on someone with a smaller chest or alien body type. Also, the silver details are not subtle and they look cheap, but probably help the alien bodies it was made for to contact the mother ship."
2.0,too high waisted for me.
2.0,Nice but runs extremely small
2.0,"It looked like I was wearing a sack, but it was comfortable."
2.0,"This is meant for petite women.  I'm a new momma.  I have a momma bust and a momma waist.  Naturally, I am a size bigger than i was before I had my child, so I ordered an XL, reading the measurements.  The fabric is SUPER SOFT, for starters and made quite nicely. It just hugs the hips and the girls.  You could totally tell when you're &#34;cold&#34; and you can see the &#34;momma chub&#34; and the outline of the belly button when wearing it.  Cute shirt though, just not for my body type."
2.0,"This is a nice fitting dress, but unfortunately the pattern in the material was just awful - a dull grey with flowers - not vibrant as shown.  Would be great in a solid or other pattern.  Unfortunately sending it back due to the pattern.  That said, very comfortable and fit nicely (I am a 6/8, 34D and ordered the S which fit perfectly)."
2.0,"I ordered 2 necklaces, one was missing some stones.. and the second one was missing stones and has a mixture of gold and silver chain on it. and to make it worse the clip did not open to even put it on."
2.0,I didn’t like it in person. Huge and long.
2.0,"I’m so bummed, I previously bought this dress in the red/wine color and it’s beautiful. Same seller, different color, I’ve ordered the same dress in black TWICE now and the length is completely off from the wine colored dress. I even sized up the second time and it was actually SHORTER! I may try to buy it once more but I’m probably going to be super disappointed if it comes short again.<br /><br />UPDATE: third purchase was even shorter! Don’t bother ordering this dress in black if you are over 5’3 ish."
2.0,The blouse itself was more like a light tablecloth. Did not even look wearable. The yellow was vibrant but cheep looking. You get what you pay for
2.0,In the picture it looking very nice .. but in real i was surprised cuz it's lookink bad :(
2.0,Very light material. You will definitely have to wear underwear. Strings are come out of it and I just got it in the mail. A small flap is supposed to cover the gap the buttons make but you can see skin all the way down the dress. A shame considering it looks cute on pictures and the color is beautiful. Not worth over 10 dollars.
2.0,"needed pairs for a gift, returning single s"
2.0,"Tight in the bust and an off white, almost dirty white color."
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress, but it just wasn't meant to be. It was both too large and too small at the same time. Furthermore, the skirt was poorly sewn, so it created a funky twist, - and not in a cute funky way. Thank goodness for Amazon's generous return policy!"
2.0,"It's a nice keychain, but after 2 months on a set of keys, the silver color started to wear off, and the small loop broke. It's unfortunate."
2.0,The ring was beautiful and my 5 year old immediately was in love with it. Just an hour later my wife and I noticed the smaller gems had already fallen off. And more have fallen since. I believe at this point about 40% of the smaller stones have fallen off. My daughter still loves the ring but it’s still disappointing. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,battery lasted one day
2.0,Which was not advertised
2.0,"Seams came apart within a day of wearing it. I did figure at the price point it wouldn't be the highest of quality, but when something is called stretchy, you assume it has the ability to stretch, but not so much. Would not buy again."
2.0,I'm 6' tall guy....200lbs.....purchased size xl.<br /><br />Waits fits fine...but it shrunk about 6 inches in the first wash.....they are not capri pants.<br />Ok for Pajamas....but nothing else....wouldn't dare leave house in these
2.0,I wanted to love this but ended up really disappointed. Runs small and color looked maroon in the pictures and is clearly red. Fabric was thin.
2.0,This new Beanie was to help out with our cold weather here in Seattle. I never had a chance to wear this cap. The knitting on the top of the hat came undone after my first wash.
2.0,It was too small !
2.0,Too thin and not worth the price.  I've purchased other better quality masks for the same price.
2.0,It's cute BUT be warned. The dress I received was not the pattern of that in the photo at all. Photo shows purple and pink. What I received was mostly orange. I thought about returning. This is definitely false advertising.
2.0,Poor quality. Set only lasted 6 weeks.
2.0,The tiara is very heavy and uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,Runs small get a size larger. Soft and comfortable fabric though.
2.0,Very cheap material. Color fades when stretched.
2.0,"It fits okay. I ordered coffee. In the photo, it looks like a great neutral color between gray and brown (a greige). It arrived very brown. I did not want a BROWN cardigan."
2.0,Way too baggy. Nothing like the picture
2.0,it was way to small and too short
2.0,The pants feel like plastic. I’ve purchased other faux leather leggings that actually has the faux leather texture.
2.0,"First, the dress fabric is great and comfy. The colors are awesome too. Unfortunately, the way it is cut is very unflattering. The dress balloons out at the hips because the pocket placement is odd. Then it tapers back in at the ankles. The proportions are very off. I tried to adjust this dress, but every attempt made me feel like a clown in a potato sack. I'm disappointed because I really wanted to like it, but sadly I am returning it."
2.0,It doesn't look like the one on the photo. It was extremely large around the neck
2.0,"Great looking for inexpensive readers, but nose piece broke off within 3 weeks."
2.0,"One washing and ALL 3 sweatshirts have pilling all over the cuffs and collar, as well as elsewhere! Unexpected since I have 2 older Russell sweatshirts with zero issues after dozens of washes! I'm gonna ask for refund!"
2.0,"Didn't like these alip ons. No support and I had to order 2 sizes up to have them fit the girls. Cute , but not worth the money."
2.0,"Designed for somebody with a big ol' bucket head! Very lightweight, don't appear all that durable, but the lenses are clear. OK sunglasses for the price."
2.0,"I am not terribly picky and am usually pleased with clothes I buy on Amazon, but this is really cheaply made and particularly the sleeves are too tight to tolerate. The body of the &#34;dress&#34; is probably sized correctly, but the sleeves are really tight. The neck is crooked and the stitching looks like it could all come unraveled at any time. I'm returning it."
2.0,Thes prongs detached on their own right away had to purchase something different that ruined my Fitbit so now I'm just out of a watch.
2.0,"These are cute, but two of the 4 broke when I unwrapped them.  As I pulled the back off of one, the pin came away from the character.  The second was Piglet and one of his legs broke off.  Wouldn't recommend...."
2.0,"The band looks great, which is why I gave it 2 stars. But it gave my child (for whom it was purchased) a terrible reaction on their wrist. There was a raised, very red, itchy and painful rash, on the bottom of the wrist that remained as long as they wore the band and healed as soon as the band was replaced with a different band. My child has never had a reaction to ""leather"" before, so this was odd, and disappointing because they wanted the black and white checkered design."
2.0,Sizing is OFF on this product. It was much too big for me. I think it would have been cute had it fit me. But it swallowed me whole.
2.0,"I like the color as purple is one of my favorites.  However, I order a 4x and when it came, it was too small. I had a family member try it on that wears a 1x and it fit her perfectly! So now she has it."
2.0,Nice BEAUTIFUL necklace.... Changed colors after 2 days.....so be careful wearing in the summer!!!
2.0,The quality is not that good.
2.0,The display is very dim
2.0,I thought it was cotton but it's more like polyester! Very cheap material. I have Prime but this order took a week to arrive!
2.0,The ankle part of the boots are very thick making them look like rain boots and also not comfortable to wear. I have skinny ankles and calves. I ordered them because I read from other reviews that the calf circumference is small for these boots. I would say the boots have an average size of calf circumference.
2.0,"The hat on the mask was cheap looking, The back of the mask did not cover the back of the neck, the socks did not have any grip on the bottom, gloves did not have long fingers as the grinch does. The mask although it was uncomfortable looked cool if you want a mean-looking Grinch."
2.0,"Dress is cute but very cheap. Also, very low cut and short."
2.0,"I loved these pants, they fit great. But they have ripped in the seams. I have only had them for a month and wear them once a week."
2.0,Not the same as in the picture.
2.0,"The sweater fits much larger than their size chart. Does not fit like it shows on the model. Also, beware the “black” sweater has bright color flecks not muted flecks as shown on sweater on model. Took over month to get. Hoping I can return. I wouldn’t buy if I were you."
2.0,"It was pretty at first, but 3 flowers fell off before the night ended. I glued one one & then two kept falling off. Embarassing!"
2.0,"Purchased to donate gloves this winter.  They are Individually wrapped which is probably good for this purpose when handing out.  I would not wash these gloves, they almost seem disposable. They do provide warmth but would only use them to donate and hopeful maybe people who need them have access to more if they  don’t last more than a week.  I’m not confident they should get very wet ever.  These saw women’s gloves. They fit my average-sized hands but much of the population won’t be able to wear these so def not a one size fits all.  So these gloves have a purpose -cost and bulk but not the best gloves overall"
2.0,I wasn't pleased with the quality - bought inexpensive and got inexpensive - i should have saved my money - but i've learned a lesson on this one - sorry
2.0,These gowns were returned as the material is poor quality and see through.
2.0,Top has NO support and can not adjust straps
2.0,"Some of the sprayers didn’t work well on my order and this company sent me a whole new set of three. They stand behind their product. I like the size, color and measuring lines on these bottles. I am now 100% satisfied with my purchase. Will buy again!"
2.0,Returned Looked faded
2.0,bottles are beautiful/sturdy but the trigger sometimes need to pump it 3 times before it goes.
2.0,Not flattering at all. Gave it 2 stars because fabric is warm and cozy but that's about it. More of a Pajama than a shirt-dress.<br /><br />Not recommended... (unless looking for a warm pj)
2.0,Returned it. The yellow was quite see thru.
2.0,"Fit like garbage.  Some fingers too tight, some too long.  I greased a pair up to see if they’d soften....they did not.  I guess I have 2 pairs of ‘I do t care if I lose them’ gloves."
2.0,"Too, too small, had to send back."
2.0,"These are cute but very very cheaply made. My 3 year old was thrilled to get these. However, they are so cheap that some of the little rhinestones were glued on upside down (metal side up). My little one didn’t care and proudly wore them for two whole days before the velcro pulled off of the strap. She is “very very sad that her shoes have broken.”"
2.0,"The fabric was more like silky pajama material as opposed to the cotton dress I purchased from another store in the same style.  It's ok, but I wouldn't wear it in public.  It looks like pajamas.  The cotton one from another store was much nicer."
2.0,Didn’t last even 4 washing laundry loads.<br />  Cheap metals.  Mask didn’t stay on my face at all
2.0,Didn't work for me. Maybe because i have darker olive skin? It's very noticeable
2.0,actually a little bigger then expected. Zippers don't zip smoothly though.
2.0,"Ok face mask. Runs small and the big filter knob is heavy. Close to the face, not very comfortable. Took forever to arrive."
2.0,"The pearls were larger than I expected but the body of the clip is so shallow, they barely hang on the edge of my earlobe!  I am afraid to wear them because one shake of my head would make them fall off.  Not pleased..."
2.0,"They sprayed some type of flat black finish on these watchbands that immediately starts wearing off when you wear it. Comfortable but getting ugly! Nothing ""quick release"" about it. I don't know why that is in the description."
2.0,Its more frustrating than helpful. you can't even get your ring over the wrap.
2.0,"Though the pants are gray, like original sweatpants, they were merely nylon, tee shirt type material.  They were very baggy as well. We returned them."
2.0,Beautiful dress great length loved the color but itchy after. Don't think it would go away with a wash. Think the material it was lined with was wrong. Esp at the neckline. So sad it has to go back.
2.0,"Not very flattering for large chested women, lots of awkward side boob. Other than the top of the romper, everything else fits true to size and even has a bit of stretch."
2.0,Not what I expected. It was super long on me and the color was not what I thought it would look like. Super cute dress just not for me.
2.0,The band had white marks on it. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:d8dd82cb133eea03d3cce51c9ff626fb]] I ordered the ALPHAWIN Watch Winder 8 for Automatic Watches to handle all my vintage 'automatic' watches in one case. This is the first 8-watch device I've found and currently this one makes my 4th unit to own. I have to say that the finish is nice but I had to remove what appeared to be random bits of adhesive from it; Strike 1. The design is bassackwards. It is nice having the motors shut down when opening the case door but the design on this case puts that open door right in between you and the watches; Strike 2. Controls are in a very odd location - the backside! What? Yeah, it is nice to have individual control over each spindle but if you have this thing in a tight space, good luck with changing your rotational settings or the lights. Strike 3. I was hoping for so much more from this device because it has the ability to keep 8 watches working and the motors are very quiet. I just think it is a very bizarre design that really isn't user-friendly."
2.0,"Lenses and frame are WAY too small and narrow for an adult face, they fit nice on my 8 year old nephew, but fortunately he doesn't need them.<br />It's a shame because I had great expectations for these glasses<br /><br />Live and learn"
2.0,"Not worth the money ,not what I thought it would be. 15.00 for a magazine not!"
2.0,"So the fit like a parachute. I got a medium am a size 8 right now& just dang, I was expecting some amount of control/ support but it’s just tons of material to cover my curves.."
2.0,The clasp just doesn't hold the bracelet closed very well and it's a little big.  Returned it.
2.0,"The design is nice, but this is a poorly made shirt. The stitching is just waiting to unravel, it runs wide and really short, but it is light weight. Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,pilled up
2.0,got the watch could not wait to wear it. fell apart.  so far haven't got to together.  not happy.
2.0,"Wonderful concept. Exactly what I needed. Had Laser Eye surgery and need 2.5 X magnification for seeing dash in car and reading. Otherwise distance is normal. Sadly, both pair (purchased two) broke in exactly the same place due to stress tension on the nose bridge. Might try buying another pair and Gorilla Glue or Super Glue a re-enforced nose bridge."
2.0,Fit was small so daughter could  not wear it.
2.0,"Cheap quality, it ripped right away in the back."
2.0,"These are not premium at all. Extremely flimsy and the lenses are thin plastic. Not dark enough. This would be a good choice if you want something practically disposable for emergencies only. Thankfully I found my real sunglasses yesterday, so my emergency has been averted! I'm keeping these as a backup pair. Not a suitable choice for daily use."
2.0,"My GPS stopped working when I replaced the OEM band of my Approach X10 with one of these straps.  I contacted Garmin's customer care and they stated that the GPS chip is IN THE BAND on the X10, so I cannot replace the band unless I get a band with the chip embedded in the strap, which these bands do not have.  The band itself feels great and is great quality but it rendered my device useless (per Garmin Support)."
2.0,its for a kid
2.0,"This shirt is very see through, and is very short nothing like picture"
2.0,"I'm 5'1"" and this comes down past my knees.  It looks nothing like the photo.  It has side pockets.  For me, I don't find it very flattering for somone short like me as it is not very form fitting and makes my body look funny like I'm being swallowed by the dress."
2.0,"this thing is short. and also smaller than other similar dresses I have ordered .. I am very tall (6'2"") and so I buy Midi dresses so I don't have my booty hanging out ... this is not a midi, and I had to return it due to it being way to small and way to short."
2.0,Will work as a bangle but will not work to hold a hairband; disappointed as that is how it was marketed.
2.0,"Only got the mug, when it was supposed to come with a scarf, necklace AND earrings.<br />Buyer beware!"
2.0,"If price was as listed, OK.<br />Package showed up with $1.62 postage due."
2.0,"So very, very, very small... Thought this may be a cute, loose feeling, renaissance or pirate like shirt... its small. Very small. I ended up giving it to my small friend who it happened to also be too small for.  Its especially tight in the upper arms and chest. Also, its short... much shorter than what it appears on the model."
2.0,Very cheep material . It is cute but paper thin and the size is not true . Always go up a size
2.0,"Very cheap, looked horrible on me. I tried to take it apart and turn it into a skirt instead because I loved the print but even that didn't look great."
2.0,"I do hope this company can measure last and toe box for American market. Super cute,on trend and cool. So sad they didn't fit. I feel if they can fit we gals from size 10 up you will have a great many sales."
2.0,"Buying tees on Amazon is a real crap shoot, and this one came up snake-eyes. I got the size recommended, and it's just too too too small. I love the design and the quality is good, but I had to send this one back because the XXL just doesn't fit, and they have no larger size."
2.0,Nice bra but stickiness doesnt last.
2.0,I washed it before I put it on my son and the gold came off and the pants looked like it had been born and washed before.
2.0,"I ended up returning it. Definitely bigger than expected. Thick material, and not soft, its scratchy on sensitive skin"
2.0,"Anything elastin (spandex) always runs small, especially in the arms. So the dress is huge but the arms are tight.<br /><br />Material is soft but thin so it shows every bump and bulge.<br /><br />I'm 5.2 and it goes below my knees."
2.0,Its pretty material but way too big and cut very oddly. Doesnt look like the picture at all.
2.0,"These fit terribly!  They scrunched my toes and were way too wide at the same time.  I can't imagine how wide they would be if I had gone up a size to accommodate my toes.  I have a normal width foot.  I consider myself an 8/8.5 and got an 8. Outside of how they fit, they looked like they would be a nicer shoe than I originally expected.  There was cushioning on the inside and they had a fairly nice sole for traction,  but obviously none of that matters if the fit is so off."
2.0,Very big. Was going to hang on car mirror.
2.0,"Let's just say the shirt looked way better in the picture than what I received. The picture gives an almost black look, but I got a dark navy blue. It texture reminded me of what umbrellas are made of, only turned into a shirt."
2.0,Was not impressed. This is basically a metal tag with a decal.
2.0,Cheap  t-shirt material. Cheap design. The iron on graphic is horrible. Looks nothing like the photo. Do not order unless you just need a cheap T-shirt to throw on for around the house. I would not wear it out. Graphic will peel when washed.
2.0,"These rings were all the same size and did not fit any of my fingers.  They look nice, thin and silver, but they would never stay on my fingers.  They unfortunately did not work for me at all."
2.0,"I wore it for just over a month and the band has fallen apart. The overall quality was not good, it did not have the same comfort and flexibility as my original fitbit band."
2.0,There was no cubic zirconia WHITE STONE as the picture suggested
2.0,"Cheap quality, especially for the price. Was good enough for a spirit day at school."
2.0,"This sweatshirt has zero stretch. It is thin and not push or cozy. The pattern is cute and colors nice, but it was not what I was looking for. It was tight around my stomach and didn't give at all. If you are looking for a thin sweatshirt, with no warmth or give  - this is for you. I was disappointed with the overall feel, as it was a little rough and scratchy. It is on the long side too. I love the tie dye design and colors, too bad about the fit and feel."
2.0,"This is an adorable charm with a meaningful quote, which is why I purchased it.<br />However, it is so small that you almost need a magnifying glass to read it! I like to refer to inspirational quotes from time to time, but the print is just too small on this.<br />The seller tacked on two post earrings to the shipping placard, which was unnecessary."
2.0,These broke within a week
2.0,"Their okay, I prefer smaller, but adjusted them to fit me, by adding, Velcro to the outside, so the fit snuggle, And yes I do use them occasionally, takes a little getting used to them, I do think the person who made these, should make the claw apparatus just a tad smaller, otherwise, their pretty fun to use."
2.0,"I travel a lot and am always looking forward to travelling better with great travel pieces. I really wanted this dress to work, unfortunately it didn’t. I was quite shocked to see the dress when I got it. The material seems to be made of inferior quality. It was also too big on me! Even though I’ve spoken to Scottevest customer service and got the recommended size, it looked big and unflattering on me. I had to return it."
2.0,It’s beautiful. The ring broke right away. My daughter can’t wear it next week for her special occasion. But really just wanted the earrings and necklace. So I’m ok with that.
2.0,"Gave two stars because my size 2 daughter loves it, even though it's an XL!!!!"
2.0,"The length is great. I'm 5'2"" and it's the perfect maxi length for me. I'm a 38C and the top is too tight on me. The fabric across my breasts is lighter looking because it's stretched. The fabric is a cheap feeling. I only got to wear it out once. I leaned against a kitchen counter and the fabric stuck to the underside of the linoleum and got a bunch of pulls in it. It's only good for lounging around the house in."
2.0,"I liked the bracelet, but if knew it came from japan I would not if ordered it."
2.0,Product broke two hrs after putting them on my daughter.
2.0,Not what I expected to hard to buckle
2.0,"There does not appear to be any RFID blocking qualities to this wallet whatsoever.  No matter where in my wallet I put my work ID card I can use it to open doors at work just like my old wallet.  Meanwhile, if I put my ID in a free RFID blocker that seems like a simple paper sleeve that came with my driver's licensed it stops it from working.  Glad I did not spend a lot of money on this.  Such a disappointment...."
2.0,Didn't fit well on fluffier body type
2.0,The material is a nice heavy quality and colors are bright but I was expecting this to be a junior size. It's probably more like a juniors large or extra large or a women's medium. I bought this for my 14 year old daughter for her birthday and I'm afraid this will be more like a night shirt on her. I'm pretty disappointed and may end up returning it if she hates it.
2.0,Very cute shirt but unfortunately the lettering stuck together when I packed it and it ripped before I even got to wear it.
2.0,"The design is very nice. The pattern is beautiful. This is like a lightweight sweater, not jersey knit. Unfortunately, the pattern is only printed on one side, and the other side is bright white, so the white shows through when stretched across the bust, which draws the eye to the bust. It looked awful. I ordered according to the size guide, but the bust was tight, the waist was just right, but the shoulders kept sliding off. Shipped faster than expected. I wish this would have worked. So pretty I gave it two stars instead of one. Going to return it."
2.0,"It took over six weeks to receive my order once it was placed. The colors are not what I expected or what the picture indicated. The red and blue are not as bold in color as shown and are more pinkish and purple. And the orange looks more like salmon than orange. I've also found the quality to be a little substandard because many of the plugs seem to have material left over from when they were made, sticking out from around the edges. It's not hard to remove it but they should come cleaned up and ready to go."
2.0,Pain in the arse to set. Don't bother. 2 stars only because I like the color options.
2.0,"So this costume managed to be too big in the waist while also being about 6"" too short (I'm 5'6"" and about 150 lbs and got a medium). So disappointed, I have usually had good luck with Rubies."
2.0,"These images are deceiving, not fitting around the waste at all. Cheap fabric too. Good intentions but images do not represent the product"
2.0,"on the posting it lists anywhere from 3t to 7 years, closer to 3t"
2.0,The shirt is gorgeous but I ordered extra large and it is more like a medium.
2.0,The size highlighted with red .. the size not for adult person I am returning it!
2.0,This dress is too big in bust and too small in the waist.  The colors in the picture are not an accurate depiction for this dress.
2.0,"I had to return these because the right shoe strap on the inside was way longer than the left shoe. I couldn't walk in them because the right shoe kept spiraling to the side. The left shoe fit perfectly. My right foot is bigger than my left foot, so it's definitely a defect. I really liked them and the size fit perfectly; wish I could have kept them!"
2.0,It was very nice looking but dark blue. I believe in the description it said royal blue.
2.0,"My kids couldn't even fit their feet in the holes, we had to cut the feet off completely."
2.0,"Not even close to being good quality. I really want to like these bc the style is great,  and I wanted a good pair of dress pants to do presentations in. These oants are cheap and scratchy and have threads sticking out"
2.0,They don't stay on my babies feet well at all. I guess if your baby wears shoes then they're fine.
2.0,Poor quality material. Feels cheap. Not worth the money.
2.0,I liked the pants but the clip closure on the waist fell off and there isn't any way to fix it. :(
2.0,Loved the pattern but fit my shape oddly. I'm 5'4 150lbs. It was NOT flattering. The shirt has really puffy shoulders which you can't tell from the picture.
2.0,"I bought for my daughters outside wedding coming up in May.  When I received it, the strings were confusing and the loops in back were sewn together. After I adjusted them, the tie strings were so difficult to insert into loops, I thought, no way is this a convenient outfit!  Very cute indeed, but I’m returning it."
2.0,Product is like nylons. Print is only on one side. Poor quality and small size.
2.0,"The top of the skirt puffs out a bit right under the seam where it meets the top of the dress, making my hips look significantly bigger than they actually are, not at all flattering on my curves."
2.0,"I adored this ring when I got it...but already 2 small stones fell out...was gonna just order another, but no.  wont do that again...im sad about this....I get my nails done and my rings are on social media A LOT...this one wont be again."
2.0,The earnings are so cute but one just refuses to go in the pearl.
2.0,Dislike the Quality of the Material .
2.0,"I ordered these from MallofAmerica and five from another vendor.  These are not wrapped in a Cosmos labeled wrapper and are an inch or two smaller than the real Cosmos headbands.  They are ok, but so tight you will get a headache by the time you finish your workout!"
2.0,This product was very sheer which is not shown in the pictures or description.
2.0,"Thought this was a good deal, but I was wrong."
2.0,Band is nice but the ID is to small and it’s to tiny not wide enough.
2.0,"Band is very thin, and easily breaks."
2.0,"The necklace and bracelet are pretty, but the quality is terrible. The whole thing feels cheap, and the bracelet broke within minutes of trying to put it on a one-year-old's wrist."
2.0,Although these were very cute….you get what you pay for. Four of the necklaces were broken. I was able to repai two of them. One of the necklaces was so knotted it took me 15 minutes to get it unknotted. Would not recommend to anyone.
2.0,"I bought this dress for my mother in law and I was a little diappointed. The color is slightly off. I thought the underlay would be a lighter cream color, when it was actually more brown. My mother in law is a size small but is large chested and the fit was tight. I would suggest ordering up. It also was frayed in  multiple places but nothing that couldnt be fixed with scissors. Overall, the price is not bad and I got in great time, however if this was in the store I would not have bought it."
2.0,"I love the look of the watch, BUT it does NOT glow in the dark.  This is the reason I purchased it.  Too bad it is too much trouble to return it!  I won't purchase again."
2.0,Much too small in chest.
2.0,"So the most important thing to note is that the dress is definitely shorter than I was hoping. In the photo the model wearing the dress wears it baggy and it falls right below her knee which was exactly what I wanted. I ordered a large, and while the baggy-ness of the dress might have made me size down to a medium, the length is significantly shorter than shown in the photo, it hits me mid-thigh in the front and not quite to the back of my knees in the back. It is made of a nice material but other than that the photo they use is kind of misleading. I was thinking I was getting a dress with tacked rolled sleeves, it’s really just a long sleeve dress. I wear a large but if the length wasn’t an issue I’d size down."
2.0,"Colors not as pictured.  Material is not see through but thin with small spandrc feel.  Returning, not comfortable enough to West to church"
2.0,"The shirt fit great, but the quality went downhill on the first wash. I just use it around the house, so it's good."
2.0,"Not sure if I really like it or not.  Because it's small I can't wear it on the correct finger, so I'm not quite sure what to do with it.  Solid ring, but scratches easily and a little uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,I ordered a medium because that is what I wear.  The medium I received was a little to tight. .
2.0,"Headline says it all. I ordered the lavender and LOVED them. The red striped pattern was only available in a size smaller than I'd ordered in the lavender, and had they been the same material it would've worked.<br /><br />I'd caution against the red stripe unless you order a size or maybe 2 up."
2.0,It sheds glittery flecks everywhere.
2.0,"came in time, but the fit is very small for a Large.  This must be a junior size."
2.0,The shirt is very cute however mine came smelling very much like eucalyptus. I tried to reach out to the company and nobody responded so I'm assuming this item has been worn and then sold to me. So I will be returning.
2.0,Cute little earrings but one was placed on the back post completely off. I'm trying to figure out how to take it off without braking the flower it self to glue it back on aligned correctly.
2.0,The idea behind these is great but they come part very easy! I used these to hold two of my 6&#34; long controllers that I use to train my Min Pins and they are constantly falling off and hitting the floor. Do not recommend unless you're using them something EXTREMELY light like keys.
2.0,"Not the best material, makes me really hot and I live  in the desert.  It’s also big for the size- so be aware when ordering!"
2.0,"The colors are the best thing ! Doesn't fit good at all! Loose stitching, poor quality!"
2.0,Not for office
2.0,"Top fits great. The bottoms do not cover my butt at all.  I’m 5’5, 130 and ordered a large.  There is no coverage for the bottom. Such a shame! Now I have to find bottoms that will work with the top."
2.0,Wow - this blouse was so sheer!  It was too large and was so transparent.  Not a fan...
2.0,"I ordered XL based on the measurements given. Beautiful colors and pattern. I loved it!  It fit perfectly. No room to spare in the bust. Just to be on the safe side, I hand washed in cold water and hung to dry. It dried without needing any ironing. But when it tried it on it had shrunk so much I couldn't get it on! Luckily I have a smaller daughter to give it too. IF I BUY AGAIN from this company I'll get XXL and keep my fingers crossed. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Just like many people on here said, I wanted to like it so bad... It's such a cute dress, and is well made, but when on certain bodies, the top half of my body looks tiny and then the skirt flares out from a higher point and makes me look pregnant.. -_- NOT cute. Not trying to look bigger. Lol. Again, cute as hell, just does not flatter all bodies."
2.0,"Unfortunately it arrived btoken took it out of the plastic and the actual pin was already detached I try to attach it but it would not fit back in, other than that it is a cute heart."
2.0,I ordered these expecting them to be regular/average fit and they were petites.
2.0,"I really wanted these to fit.  They are nice and warm, and would have been perfect for my upcoming trip to Iceland.  But the sizing is very strange.  They are enormous around the hips, but the legs are so tight I cannot bend my knees at all.  Plus, the overall length is OK, but the inseam is too short, so the crotch hangs down too far.  So I have to send them back."
2.0,Not what the picture showed. Do not get these if your ears are sensitive.
2.0,First there is NO black lining/slip NONE so it's just a piece of stiff see-through lace. The red and white applique is just too vibrant and looks cheap. Not a fan of this dress.
2.0,"The fabric was very faded and the fit wasn't great, on me, anyway."
2.0,"I am going to return this item, sorry."
2.0,Fit was fine but I did not notice 2 small holes on the upper left shoulder until after I could not return it. Now I'm stuck with a sweater I cannot wear or return.
2.0,The glasses are nice looking but I don't like how they give off these purple to rainbow spots. That's not a good thing.  Not happy with them.
2.0,"I like the clutch itself but they advertise receiving the black one and the red one, I only received the red one and they were unable to send the black one. I ended up sending the red one back. So what I received wasn’t as advertised"
2.0,"I have purchased silk gloves before on Amazon and they were great.  These were the only option I could find to buy again, and they were way too long!  I have large hands too, for a woman.  Seems they are only for men now."
2.0,"I'm going to have to take this in at the waist. Removing the sleeves, too. The bottom doesn't flow well and the split is weird. I don't mind that its a bit see-through; the reviews were clear on that. I really hate that I bought it in three colors- joke is on me!"
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. It looked so pretty online. I bought both a medium and a small, not knowing which size would be best. Both were so awkward feeling and uncomfortable. As a lot of reviews have mentioned, the arm holes are super tight and I am small framed. It's very sheer, almost like a bathing suit cover up, not a dress. It's also short (both sizes). I am 5'7 and 125lbs, 32DD for reference."
2.0,product just doesn't look right on. way to cheap looking
2.0,"I always review sizing and do not buy unless I am really sure. While I can get these on, they are a bit too tight. There will be no working out in these. I would wear them on a walk, but not a true workout."
2.0,This necklace was a disappointment.  I returned it.
2.0,Was really excited about this jacket however I received it with pink/red writing all over it.. not sure what happened there but truly bummed.<br />Returning asap<br />Quality was a little poor as well
2.0,The print on the dress was not the same as pictured.  The material was very shiny and looked like polyester.  I am returning the item because it was not what I expected.
2.0,"It is a very cute piece of jewelry, the only issue is that it is super tiny. The dangling part constantly is getting tangled and it digs into your stomach. The picture makes it look larger than it is. Would not recommend this product."
2.0,"I had high hopes after reading all the reviews.<br /><br />I wear a size 10 and have flat feet, plantar fasciitis and tarsal tunnel syndrome. The cork bottom was quick drying and had an interesting feeling on the foot. The upper material was soft against the skin so I doubt it would rub.<br />The sandal was a snug fit in the heel and toes. Technically, it was a perfect fit...until I tried walking. I found my heel striking the edge which only served to aggravate my heel pain further. (Minus one star). Although the company states that the sandel relieves heel pain, just standing, the material cupped the heel well, but no real padding or elevation which helped (Minus one star).<br />I could feel the built in arch support which was great, but the material on the bottom of the sandal is rounded, curving up where the arch is which leaves a space between the sandal and the ground. This allows the the foot to pronate as weight is placed on the sandel which defeats the entire purpose of having a built in arch. (Minus one star).<br /><br />I really wanted to like the sandal, and for most I’m sure it would be fine. But the arch was the deal breaker for me. For anyone with mechanical Tarsal tunnel, avoid this sandal AT ALL COST. It is not for you. The allowed pronation by the arch will make the condition worse...quickly. Vionic has an arch that will not collapse and is a much better option for TTS."
2.0,"The item I received is two different shades of gray, and has a white string (not black as shown). I was able to contact the seller, and they gave me a refund, but I'm writing this review anyway for others. Just beware that the bottom of the bodice, and the ends (cuffs?) of the sleeves are a very different shade of gray from the rest of the garment."
2.0,"I received a watch and gave it to my girlfriend. Everything looked fine besides some funny Engrish in the manual, but then after using it for a day, she let me know that the strap had broken.<br /><br />Okay then, I contacted the seller to ask them to send a replacement band. They responded relatively quickly asking for a picture, which I provided, and then they said they would send a replacement.<br /><br />That's all fine and dandy.<br /><br />Today I received the ""replacement"" and it turned out to be not 1, not 2, not 3, but 5 watches! Very confused, I looked at all of them, to see that every single one of them had a damaged band as well. Clearly this company has an issue with quality with its bands. (Take a look at the pictures to see all 6 watches and their bands.)<br /><br />It appears to me that this company values quantity far over quality. I can imagine when they received my email they probably said something along the lines of ""oh, he got a watch with a damaged band? Well, we have 5 other watches with damaged bands. Let's just send him all of these and call it a day. I'm sure he'll enjoy that.""<br /><br />We'll see if I can manage to get a refund seeing how it's 1 day past the return date. *sigh*"
2.0,"Product is cheaply  made, my grand daughter put it on and it tore, NEVER AGAIN !"
2.0,"Charcoal color is much lighter than pictured.  Tie is 20.5&#34; long, NOT 23&#34; as advertised.  Returning..."
2.0,The bow fell apart in a sec. The ears are so tight and gave headaches
2.0,It definitely was not worth what I paid for it. It's also hard to put on I expected better quality for these items for what I paid for them. I would've paid at the most 5 for these not $15.99 it's not as nice as the pictures show won't be buying from this company again. I got this for my Son & his girlfriend cause he asked me too it's cheaply made Definitely not worth what I paid for it: (
2.0,"Super flimsy, looks somewhat like the picture but would probably break after I wore them once."
2.0,"Got this for my wife and she just doesn't like it.  She's 5'4"" and 110lbs and we got a size small (smallest listed size as of the time of this review).  This style is supposed to be flowy, but even considering that she still feels it's way too big. Fabric and materials seem to be of decent quality.  Based on our experience, go a size down."
2.0,Not very good. I should have know better. Quality is low and design in person is garbage. You get what ya pay for.
2.0,"I was disappointed, because I thought the dress was really cute..."
2.0,Very light weight you can see light beaming through the fabrics weave  when you put it on. I expected a higher quality material for the price. The patch itself is nice however as well a the drape of the actual hood is generous. I also recieved the wrong hoodie not as pictured it's going back .
2.0,"I don't liked,no good quality"
2.0,"Quick shipping, came with 2 stains!!!!"
2.0,I used this product for 6 months and one of two dangerously snapped going downhill at the locking junction.  I initially would have recommended it but I advise caution as it is unpredictable in quality
2.0,Fell off my ankle within the 1st wearing.  Just fell off and broke.  Cheaply made.
2.0,Quality is nice but I ordered a small and it fits more like a medium. Wish there was an extra small.
2.0,Too short and too thin but I love it still
2.0,"What you should first ask yourself about this shirt is… “It’s only $8, so what could possibly go wrong?!” and then go put your $8 towards something else. Crooked pocket, uncomfortable material, poor sewing... I would not recommend this.<br /><br />I usually buy smalls, and the small in this fit as expected. That’s about where my positive feelings end towards this shirt.<br /><br />After ordering, it took a month and a half to finally arrive. That put me outside the 30 day “free return” period before it was even delivered. Hmm… I contacted the company to still see if a return was possible, and never heard back.<br /><br />I was not impressed with the quality or the material. The pocket was sewn on crooked and the material is thin and feels like it's made from the same type of material used in swimming suits. The floral and striped patterns are on the outside of the shirt, but the inside of the shirt is white... Like a swimming suit.<br /><br />I'm not usually bothered by wrinkles, but this material wrinkles like nothing I've ever experienced before. After trying on a jacket over this shirt, my shirt looks like I had just come out of a season long hibernation being wrapped up tightly in bed."
2.0,"Bought the robe for my hospital stay when I deliver my baby. Color is lighter than I expected. I should have just gotten black or navy. Material is a bit stiff, not as soft as I expected the waffle cotton to be. Debating if I should get another. Not sure if it’s worth it."
2.0,es linda pero me mandaron una talla grande :(
2.0,Can see straight through wear something underneath! and materials very thin :/
2.0,The rings are extremely tiny! I have very long skinny fingers and they didn't fit. I would say these rings are probably meant for a child.
2.0,"There's nothing wrong with the product but they don't tell you that they are made of a stretch material. This makes the shirt cling to your body, not ideal in Florida when trying to stay cool. If one were to look at the picture it shows the shirt hanging loosely but that is not the case."
2.0,Not for full chested women
2.0,"Paid Too much for lights that don't work! Only one shoe works..very dissapointet! Not worth it, but shoes looks great on! Great seller!"
2.0,"Ordered 2 LG and Xtra LG both were to small normally where a large ,material is thin, see through,and clingy very cute style"
2.0,"I find myself never wearing the watch I attached this band to.<br /><br />The problem is the leather is too stiff, and it is difficult to close the clasp and get the open<br />end into the loop.<br /><br />I would not buy another one."
2.0,Cute product but zipper broke in a few days.
2.0,Glasses worked great but the coating dissolved after using at sea. Not durable for salt spray apparently. Too bad because I really liked the optics. Any chance of a replacement? I'll stick to fresh water with them next time!!
2.0,The picture shows it looking rather purple. Turns out it is light tan. Why do these companies always try to make up names for colors. Just say what it is. Pretty pissed about it. But what you gonna do right?
2.0,Winter wear please replace the coat with a large and new zipper
2.0,"Very comfortable however, thinner than expected, no pockets of any kind. Would not use for workouts, rolls down will not stay up despite high waist, and a bit long so if you are on the shorter side (I'm 5'2"") there is excess fabric."
2.0,"Current price $32.98. I ordered size Medium - yellow. As you can tell, the sweater is not the color I ordered. That being said - pick the sweater based on the picture and not on the description. The sweater is quite nice but if you have sensitive skin this might not be a good choice. It is a bit itchy - or just wear long sleeves under it. Well made. 2 Stars - Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. Medium fits well."
2.0,"I bought these socks after hearing so many great reviews and for the first month after wearing them I was right along with everyone else. No issues, my feet felt pretty good, but are they worth the price? Absoutetly not. I wear boots 5 days a week for 12 hours in the military and I'm constantly moving around and climbing ladders, and just on my feet. They just aren't that much better than $12 socks I could find anywhere else.<br /><br />They also shrink crazy fast. I bought a large and followed directions on how to care for these and now they're like a smallish medium so putting them on is a massive hassle. Almost to the point where I don't wear them anymore. I dropped $65 on three pairs of these socks and I can only wear one pair as of now.<br /><br />If I were you I'd look at getting another brand of wool socks."
2.0,They are pretty comfortable but they fog up like crazy!!! So disappointed.
2.0,"Sizing is way off, way to big."
2.0,I have used it everyday for 9 months and the bottoms are cracked on both. It looks like the top of a right moccasin was used for the left one. Not a big deal but it looked funny until they broke in. I rather spend more money for a quality product but it is getting harder to find quality products on Amazon.
2.0,I don’t like this.  The edging is extremely tight and leaves and indentation on my forehead that actually hurts.
2.0,"Wanted something small, this was a little too big."
2.0,"This belt was afordable and looks amazing, but the buckle broke less than a week after I got it. Would not recommend buying !"
2.0,This is not a sweatshirt...way too thin. The size is smaller then expected.
2.0,"I purchased this sweater in grey size small and when the green color was back in stock I ordered it right away in size small. It seemed very long and oversized, and it fit more like an ankle-length bathrobe. Just to be sure, I measured both sweaters (see pictures). I love the color of this sweater and the workmanship is good, but it’s huge and I had to return it."
2.0,These are not real pearls.
2.0,I don’t like the gold frame. I’m not a gold girl.  I wish the frame was silver. I’m a silver sweetheart.❤️
2.0,The wire at the edge of the brim made it impossible to get the &#34;bumps&#34; out and a smooth shape. The crown was very deep. I got lost in the hat.
2.0,Beautiful coat but sizes are off buy up a size.
2.0,"Beautiful color!! Unfortunately the fit is awful. Im 5""5 125lbs and I felt like i was wearing a blue bag. Not flattering"
2.0,Does not fit the phone properly
2.0,"Not like picture at all. Picture shows a full-looking scarf with lots of fabric. What I got was a thin, narrow scarf. Sending back"
2.0,Great price and classic design... returned mine because the strap was not long enough and looked like a kids cereal box watch on my wrist
2.0,The clasp of this necklace tears up the back of my neck every time I wear it
2.0,"I've been using this wristband for nearly a week and my initial impression was unequivocally positive.  However, two negative circumstances have drastically changed my opinion; this wristband may intermittently detach itself from your watch.  On two separate occasions my watchband separated from the watch for no known reason.  The first was while riding my motorcycle and the band separated (goodbye band retaining pin).  Fortunately I was able to grab my watch and hold it with my opposing hand until I was able to pull over and put the watch and band in my pocket.  After using the spare band retaining pin to reassemble the watch, and using the two in concert for another day, I had another failure of the band when I was simply bending over to pick something up off the ground (I didn't even begin to pick the object up or contort my hand to have any impact on the muscles in my wrist that might have affected the band).  During both instances there was no other object applying force or pressure on the wristband when it separated.  I have worked out several times, went running, and even slept with this band and did not have any issues; I also cannot replicate or duplicate the band's failure by shaking my wrist or hand.  It is extremely unfortunate that the supplied pins included with the band appear to be the limiting factor.  I like the design, comfort, and ease of use of this band, but the unreliability of it renders it borderline useless.  I shouldn't have to remove my watch to ride a motorcycle but I'm unwilling to gamble the security a $200 investment anymore on the durability and reliability of this band.<br /><br />Update: I've given up on the band.  It just isn't worth it anymore to risk randomly having my watch fall off my wrist.  If the company would fix the issue of the band retention pins wiggling free and separating from the watch, this would be a real winner at a great price.  Unfortunately, no band is of any value when it fails to remain secured to the watch."
2.0,Not great.  Cheaply made.  Fits small.
2.0,"The pants are over sized and the shirt is too small.  It could be my body.  (5'2 170lbs) The material is really thin and the straps are the same ribbon that you would buy a spaghetti strapped at wal-mart for $5.  They specify that this is a vintage velour, maybe I don't know my fabrics well if that means something to someone, I just got it because it was red and looked flashy.  Also the waistline is a thick elastic, that wasn't too appealing either.  I will continue wearing it as I paid $100 including shipping for it.  I needed it for a romantic weekend getaway and didn't have enough time to replace it with something else.  So i'm stuck with it."
2.0,"I got the ""Linen Camo"" in XL.  I fit about a 10/12 normally and like a relaxed fit.  SO the fit and cut is as expected, totally fine, but the material is NOT what they said- there is NO COTTON or LINEN in these shorts- they are printed heavy spandex jersey material. Pretty disappointed in the false advertising- I was hoping for something light and summery, but these are very thick/heavy.  I would return, but I am pregnant and need a pair of shorts that actually fits, and since they do, I am keeping.  There's probably a dozen different Chinese manufacturers of this pattern- be careful who you order from if you want actual Linen."
2.0,These are extremely difficult to get on and they are not comfortable.
2.0,The mask came with missing rhinestones. It’s so pretty and thick but it’s missing rhinestones at the center of the mask. So it’s very noticeable.
2.0,"I like this dress, but it's way to large/long. I def rec ordering a size down."
2.0,The buckle is too wide to fit the majority of hiking shorts and pants.
2.0,These are pretty small and they don’t stretch very well. They fit me ok size 6 womens.
2.0,"Eh, it’s nice. It’s bright and cool looking. However, the battery box is touchy - doesn’t close without force. The mask is totally flat and sticks way off of my 10-year-old’s face. Most oddly, though, the battery box makes a high-pitched squealing noise that’s audible from the next room when the light is on. If the light flashes, the noise is intermittent, so it’s clearly the light. That’s annoying when that box is right by your ear and definitely concerning when your kid is wearing it to school. We will probably keep it because my son thinks it’s cool, but I’m disappointed that I spent $40 on this thing (on sale). It’s maybe worth $15, honestly. Up to you, but I wouldn’t buy it again."
2.0,"I bought this hat because it is very similar to a hat sold by Boston Proper for $99.00.  I can only give this hat 2 stars because although it is a well made, sturdy hat, it is WAY too big.  I do not have a small head and the hat is so big on me I could never wear it.  If I can't find a way to shrink it, I will have to return it."
2.0,I loved the ring's color but the blue soon peeled off after I forgot to take it off when I went swimming.
2.0,"Fits like a US size 5T  (I ordered 7-8). Fabric ""itchy"" according to my kid. Looks nice but feels awful and is too small."
2.0,"The buttons were mismatched -- they were different colors (some were yellow, some were white)."
2.0,broke very soon after
2.0,"XL fits more like a medium. Anyone with wide shoulders or a thick chest will not find it comfortable. Also, the zipper is secured on the opposite side of every zipper jacket I own. Very thin material which would snag easily in any type of thick outdoor brush."
2.0,"Its cute but the way it opens, contents can fall out if you aren't careful"
2.0,Nice looking. But the connectors in the back don’t work. I have to either tie them or use a safety pin.
2.0,"I loved the leggings when I unpackaged them, but The second time I wore them to the gym, they split down the butt crack in the beginning of my leg day."
2.0,Beautiful dress but the colors faded and fuzzy after the first wash.
2.0,Returned product because it ran small.  I am a 12 and got a large but very tight plus I did not like the spandex like material.
2.0,"This is a nice chain but after wearing daily for a year, the clasp stopped functioning correctly and my cross started falling off of the chain. I bought a replacement from another vendor who, I hope, has a higher quality clasp."
2.0,"I really love the feel of the fabric, but it pills very easily and the fit is a bit awkward. You definitely need to size up."
2.0,Picture shown in ad is different than actual blouse. The material is not figure flattering it actually makes you look bigger. I gave the blouse to my daughter and was disappointed by misrepresentation.
2.0,"Falls off all the time, easily unhooks while wearing. Disconnects from watch face"
2.0,I wasn't expecting much but these glasses were so poor in quality and you could even see some unpainted spots on them.
2.0,"There was no indication of fit, so I had to guess on size to order.  This item runs small and did not fit."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:b24fc02b845aab2174dd76a1699c9782]] Okay so I ordered this because I thought it looked the most authentic for the price beware folks you get what you pay for. The horns are definitely flimsy they have foam in them okay nothing of hard or construction as they said. So I had to spend time stuffing these horns so they would with bags so they would look more authentic not going to be much heavier at all because  used regular like Meijer Walmart bags and then I had to cut the foam so that it would still be able to fit in the base of the horn the construction would not be all flimsy. So really not as described but they'll do I guess. Plus you're supposed to get a shawl with us they tell you it comes with the horns and a shawl I didn't get a shawl. Real bad not good but I already worked with them so I can't send them back very disappointed
2.0,The straps snapped off 2 of them so far on  first wear - I got what I paid for. Joe Boxer long camis are just a few dollars more and don't fall apart.
2.0,"I expected the headbands to be heavier, terrycloth. Very flimsy and not very sweat absorbent"
2.0,Made for a man size necklace
2.0,It feels like a costume. But fits good
2.0,"Gloves were for Halloween costume, so no big deal, but they were not well made.<br />They did, however look awesome with my costume."
2.0,"Cheaply made, wore once and frayed."
2.0,Not a good snug fit or good quality.
2.0,Broken very easily
2.0,"Fell apart in 2 months,  very poor quality. Looks great, and I even prayed it with leather protector but the front pocket started unraveling at the seems."
2.0,too small on the neck section. material feels ok though.
2.0,"These earrings are very dainty. I work in the lunchroom cafeteria and we can't wear large earrings, but  for me these are a bit too small."
2.0,"Pretty, but difficult to open."
2.0,Very attractively coloured. Not plus sized.
2.0,Runs too small does not correspond to the picture...ends below knees
2.0,The style is very nice but my 5 yr old feels them too tight on his face. Two stars for the style too bad they're not more comfortable.
2.0,The edges of the band stick out where the band attaches to the watch.  Not a proper fit.
2.0,Cheap material. Fine for &#34;under&#34; a jacket for a nice design punch...
2.0,Very bad material. Size large is like a small.
2.0,Weird material and not a good fit for me.
2.0,"too small, way shorter than pictured and very light fabric"
2.0,It is not true to size. Now I have to alter it to make it work and that's not what I paid for.
2.0,"I read the reviews, and should have listened! It’s a cute dress, the material is ok, and the color, and design is cute buuuuuut.... if you have big breasts, don’t even bother with it!! Completely opens up and the girls are free for everyone to see!! I thought about taking it to get a few stitches to close it up, but didn’t think it was worth the money and returned it instead. Cute, but not designed very well."
2.0,"Compared to what one might expect in a polarized lens, this one has a very unacceptable, almost weird, brown tint that produces an unrealistic and unpleasant view."
2.0,Way to small! I’m. 6 foot 185 and the shirt was too small.
2.0,"The belt seems to be well made, the ratchet works good, BUT, IT STINKS ! I MEAN A REAL STENCH ! I had to put it outside to hopefully rid it of the foul odor, still stinks... Very Disappointed in this as you don't wish to wear something that when you get near em people ask what that that STINKS ! Don't know why it stinks maybe it'll wear off, BUT don't think it will.https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JEBM1wAnL._SS300_.jpg"
2.0,"I read previous reviews saying this item runs small, so I ordered one size larger. I was disappointed that it was still too small. I should have ordered two sizes larger."
2.0,I was disappointed with the fabric and had to return the product
2.0,Disliked not getting what we were told we were getting
2.0,Sides are narrow so it doesn't block sun and blows over with little wind. Material is thin and sun pushed through
2.0,They are supposed to be exlarge and they aren't even a small. They wouldn't even fit a child!!!!!
2.0,Scarf was very cheap looking.
2.0,The ring is very pretty however after my daughter wore it once her finger turned green and the ring faded.
2.0,"Super cute, but the ear broke off on the first day...this was for an older child so it was not under undue stress."
2.0,"The top was too small and the bottom was too big. The snaps on the top wouldn't stay closed either. I've worn quite a few costumes before as I enjoy the occasion contest and cosplay events, but the sewing and sizing of this is all wrong. I had to wear another top to the costume party. I don't see how anyone could keeps the snaps closed on the top."
2.0,"First off these are not bifocal lenses as I ordered, and as advertised... I ordered a brown pair and got ones that had a fade from light brown to darker brown.... disappointed."
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it was way too small. I wear between and xl and a 1x so i sized up. It's made very cheap and not worth the money. I'm disappointed.
2.0,"I used this handle wrap on my pull-up bar.  There is absolutely no cushion.  It's only better than grabbing the metal part directly.  It has two benefits:<br /><br />1.  Metal won't get rusted as fast because the hands' sweat aren't directly touching the metal bar.<br /><br />2.  Metals are more slippery so this wrap provides better grip.<br /><br />BUT AGAIN, THERE IS NO CUSHION.  ZERO, NONE!  Don't buy it because you are hoping to get a cushion.  Many of the new travel luggage bags already com with better cushion, so this item won't add any value for most of the new travel case/bag.  If you have a handle with &#34;all metal&#34; part then yes, this is better than nothing."
2.0,"Cheaply made. Broke while wearing the first time. Not able to fix. Not worth returning. Pretty, but poor quality. Get what you pay for. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
2.0,too big and cheap plastics
2.0,"This is a really weird shape. Its tight and bunchy at the bottom making the bottom of it stay behind you all the time. But, the sleeves are long, which I need for my long arms. The color does not look anything like the pictures, I ordered pink."
2.0,Didn't want to go through the hassle of returning because it was cheap
2.0,The waist opening on these jeans is so small it's hard to draw them up over the buttocks.  This was a huge difference from the product as it was in years past.  I would not buy again.
2.0,Fits great but it doesn't glow. I got one for my 2 year old and one for my 9 year old and neither one glows in the dark. they were really disappointed because they thought they would glow.
2.0,"Gift for grandson, but it is too small."
2.0,Have to really look closely in order to be able to read the shirt.
2.0,I'll just regift it.
2.0,"Broke second time wearing it, just kept braking."
2.0,"This dress was disappointing.  The fabric was very light and flimsy and the colors were drab.  Also, it was too long."
2.0,The fabric was fine for the price.  The fit was at least 2 sizes smaller than expected.  The XL was more like a medium.  This is not only a Junior fit but a small one at that.
2.0,Love the dress!!! I am giving 2 stars because I have found some slight stains on the dress and belt... like 3 stains. They almost look like splatter stains. I was looking and trying to contact the seller to see if they wanted to send me a new one and I return this but I was unsuccessful. I’ll upload some pictures too. I am 5’5” 195 and got a large and it’s a little big from the waist down but I really like it a lot
2.0,The ball on the earring is too large!
2.0,Hard to use and easy to lose
2.0,Did not last long. Broke not long after I had it.
2.0,"The quality of the shirt is nice, and I really do like it. The main problem is that I ordered a size large, and what I got fit my 7-yr-old sister perfectly. I'm an average-sized 5'7"" girl, and normally a size large fits me well. But in this case, it was so tiny that my 4'0"" little sister fit it...well...perfectly. It's nice, it's dashing, and all that, and for the price ($10), you'd think you can't lose, but if you can't even fit it...well... *shrug*"
2.0,"I’m 36C, 28 waist, 35 hips. I got these in a large. I don’t like them. They don’t look or fit like a crop but rather a sports bra, except without any support. There’s a thin band on the hem. I don’t like these at all. Maybe if I got a size smaller they’d work ok for like a bralette, but I ordered in anticipation of them fitting like a crop top...."
2.0,Hilariously gigantic. I’m 5’0” y’all & the sleeves go well past my hands. The rest of the proportions look absurd on me. Definitely for a tall person. Returning the dress was $7 shipping.. so I paid money for a dress I’m never going to wear
2.0,Product photos show a tanish-brown pair of pants. What arrived was dark grey. Will be returning for refund
2.0,It’s comfortable but it’s not adult size ( to small )
2.0,Cute but differently not OVERSIZED as stated in description. They look as if they are for a child. Will not be ordering anymore from seller.
2.0,"Out of the package, the dress smelled horrible.  I ordered a Large size but received a small.  When I tried to reorder a Large, none were available so I have washed the dress multiple times.  Air dry of course!  I am hoping that I can find a friend who can wear this size.  I would not buy this dress again."
2.0,The size is fine they are to itchy on my skin
2.0,I have no idea where I put those pants and I wish I returned them on time..these things are 6 feet long. No joke they go up to my neck and have room left over. I never tried them on and I have misplaced them and now it’s just a waste of money.
2.0,Better for day driving than nighttime
2.0,I got two of the same pieces to put it together so the whole thing wouldn’t settle into the grooves like they are supposed to. If I got the two right pieces it would’ve been so perfect. I’ve seen great reviews so I guess it’s hit or miss with this product.
2.0,Way too heavy to wear as a mask. May glue it to a long cigarette holder to “hold” as a masquerade ball mask.
2.0,"Bad cut on the shoulders, makes look too wide. It would have been a nice dress otherwise"
2.0,its sad because i am soooo in love with this ring but it broke after a week.
2.0,The lens produces distortion for my eyes. Need a lot of sun light to see through them. Wearing them in the shade or entering a building completely reduces your ability to see.
2.0,"All of my other large helmets fit snug, this one fits loose no matter how hard I try to tighten the chin strap."
2.0,Finish started coming off and gave my wife a rash
2.0,"Ordered a size medium, probably could have went with a small (5’3” ~140lb). Dress is cute but the fabric is way too thin and staticky to look good on. Would look much better if it had some sort of lining under the dress. Will be returning."
2.0,"Colors are not as pictured.. I was looking forward to some bright, summer earrings and these showed up as darker fall colors. Would’ve been cute earrings if the colors were just accurate."
2.0,"Broke 1st use. One of the letters broke off and it was not even used long,  not taken on & off head. Disappointed."
2.0,"Backs were not well made, bent out of shape."
2.0,Stones looked plastic not shiny like cubic zirconia.  Kind of look like a child’s dress up item.
2.0,The quality of the pants is good and the stitching is good.  It was also accurate as far as sizing.  However the colors are really far off at least for the Ranger Green.  The top of this picture is true Ranger Green and the bottom is the color of the pants that were sent which is like an Olive Drab and no where close to Ranger Green.  Ranger Green is a very specific hex code and isn't supposed to be advertised on other colors that are not really Ranger Green.  Will end up returning as it doesn't go with any of my kit.  If color doesn't bother you the pants were otherwise good to go.
2.0,"Nice fabric, washes well.  bottom fits fine, but top not true to size"
2.0,Extremely cheap and flimsy so don't expect them to take a lot of abuse.  They are not expandable.  I am looking for another set of luggage.
2.0,The pendant separated from the metal that holds to the cord. I contact the seller and asked if I could exchange for another one or fix this one and my email was never answered.
2.0,"This is a stretchy top meant to form fit, not wear as an oversized top like pictured. Looks like it’s still a good shirt if you like that style. I gave mine to my mom but she hasn’t worn it yet"
2.0,I realize it says a random but not one on the picture sample was received. Very disappointing.
2.0,"These showed up with a hole in them, and have pills all over the fabric. Terrible quality, will not purchase again."
2.0,"case was okay wanted to use it for battery and extra filters, but it is easier to just have a box of extra filters in my purse."
2.0,"2 stars only because they are so cute. I don’t know if these have something that makes the mirrored lenses have a prescription strength or inner glare, but these sunglasses made me very dizzy and gave me a serious headache."
2.0,It's been a week since I've received these gloves. I use these type of coated gloves for the grip as I work in a warehouse. I'm fully aware from the many pairs of gloves I've used that these kind of coated gloves usually only last 2-3 weeks. I've only used the pair in the picture for a week. For some reason these gloves only lasted me a week. Very unfortunate.
2.0,These earrings were not as glittery and classy as I thought.  I kept them because it would take too much to just send them back.
2.0,had to return because i lost one of the charms.
2.0,Could be great-Good material but poorly stitched waistline
2.0,"The good: the material is very stretchy and forgiving and not see through at all. At 5’3”, this was the perfect length maxi dress, coming right above my ankle. The bad: the dress is labeled as 100% cotton, but there is no cotton in it whatsoever, it is the same material as a running shirt. The neck was too big, and there is darting in the chest that made my chest look lumpy and landed in a weird spot. The pockets land squarely on your hips, making you look way wider. I will be returning this."
2.0,The &#34;medium&#34; for this shirt fit like a &#34;small&#34; in other shirts
2.0,Great looking belt! A little on the small side. I ordered it the same size as my pants size and in order to get the belt to fasten it has to be on the last hole. My other HUGE complaint I have...IT STAINS CLOTHES! There's two bands of brown around the waist of every pair of pants I've worn this with. I've used all sorts of detergents to get it out but it is permanent.<br /><br />Reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is a nice looking belt lol. But I absolutely would never have bought it had I known then what I know now.
2.0,"I loooved this sweater, I had super high hope. It lasted for a while but the knit began to come out and their would be knit sticking out. It ruined the look and made it look old and cheap. It also began to get little pills very quickly. I really did like this sweater though, I wish the knit was a better quality."
2.0,The earrings I received are just plain dark brown.  They do not have the lovely color variation shown in this photo.  Won't bother returning them because I might wear them but they aren't special at all.  Do not recommend.
2.0,Gave them to a employee here at Windsor Care Center.
2.0,COVID19 use
2.0,It's silver plated so that means if it rubs on anything the copper red/pink will start showing within days<br />I take it off before bed and showers<br />Bur it still has rubbing from gun :/<br />It's so cute and funny but doesn't last
2.0,"This item is not what I expected.  There is no drawstring to be able to hang from for straining.  If you're looking for something to strain (like for sprouting beans or straining nut milks), this is not the bag you want.  This just has elastic at the top that will fit over the top of a jar."
2.0,The dress looks beautiful online. When I got it in the mail it was a very wrinkled and was coming apart around the bustline. Unfortunately I cannot wear it so I wasted my money. I should have paid more attention to the comments so I will not be getting any more from this seller.
2.0,Item not as pictured
2.0,"Inexpensive, colorful. Mom likes them. Not high quality and could get them locally for under 5.00 but mom had a gift card."
2.0,way oversized
2.0,Ordered the size 10-11 for my 9 year old and they were wayyyyy to small. We gave them to my 5 year old niece and they fit her perfectly.
2.0,"This suit definitely isn’t for women with an average or large chest because there’s absolutely no support. The top is too large, too, and the overall fit is awkward all around."
2.0,Opening hole is way too small can't get a chain through
2.0,Cheap for a reason...I got it for a girl and she liked them though.
2.0,The drawstring waist line isn't consistently tapered with the leggings making it very tight compared to the rest of the legging and uncomfortable. Not to mention that the drawstring came out the first time I washed them even though I tied the strings together. It may just be that this pair is just made incorrectly and may not be the case for other pairs so use your own judgement.
2.0,They’re very big.
2.0,They were rather lengthy and didn’t sit quite right on my earlobe.
2.0,Run big and not the best quality. T-shirt material
2.0,not please with quality am returning
2.0,"So the sunglasses themselves are great and our son really likes them but they snapped after a month or two. Now in general this wouldn't be a huge deal because they're not super expensive and I know kids break things. However, I'm disappointed with the response from the company. They send all these emails about &#34;contact us if you have any issues and we'll fix it, don't write a negative review, etc.&#34; I contacted them, was told that since Amazon fulfilled the order they would &#34;make it right&#34; and ended up getting nowhere with anyone. Got more followup emails saying &#34;please contact us if you have any problems&#34; which I responded to and received no response. Really can't figure out the point of all this communication if they're not actually going to bother to do anything."
2.0,"Wish they had half sizes. The 8 was too small. The 9 was way too big. Otherwise, cute and as pictured!"
2.0,"The fabric was an awful texture, clingy, cheap, not cotton. Runs on the small side."
2.0,"As other mentioned in their review, this is way toooooo long! I’m tall 5”7’ and it drags on the floor… no heels…. It’s also very stretchy in the waist so was kind of big"
2.0,"The name ""Running Girl"" is kind of a joke considering how bad this bra is for running. The padding is odd, it's like it's more for push-up purposes than for holding things in place. The fabric is VERY stretchy, definitely needs a higher spandex content. And after only a 2.5 mile run, the front strap rubbed a raw spot into my skin. (see pic) It was actually bleeding, but I wiped the blood away before taking the pic. The back bra-type clasp is a very rough/rigid elastic with sharp corners that dig into my back. This bra might be good for something low impact like yoga or pilates or weight lifting, but it's awful for running."
2.0,"Son initially flipped out and loved them just because they were Among Us, but after adding to Croc brand shoes, we have lost over half jist on weekend outings as he is not allowed to wear to school. These were our first charms so I am unsure how many to expect to lose or if these particular charms were ill sized?"
2.0,Much smaller than they look. I was expecting something longer. Too small for what I was looking for.
2.0,I’m disappointed in myself for buying this. Returned immediately.
2.0,"Giving this two stars only cause the design is pretty. Fabric is not flannel. I'm a seamstress and work with fabrics all the time. This fabric is not a tight weave, is not brushed flannel and is scratchy to the touch. I'm curious why some say it is soft?!?"
2.0,"Did not have the ""Homies"" at the bottom which was why I bought this shirt for my boyfriend. I was definitely pissed off smh"
2.0,This was knee high not as presented - too long
2.0,"Not quite what I expected....thought I was getting a pretty sky blue color and its more of a bright electric blue color, super bold, like visible from far away bright. I ordered my usual size of medium, I am 160lb and 5'8. Its pretty short, and tight enough that it rises up when I walk. This might have to do with the weird liner which is a shiny, slick satiny material that doesn't breath well. I took a chance on this one, had potential, but its a miss for me."
2.0,This shirt is a thin material but soft. This runs small. The laces were short and looked cheap as they were not even sewn on the end just cut. I would not buy this again. This shirt was a dissapointment for me. From the description I expected more quality. Because of these issues I can not recommend this item.
2.0,Did not fit like photo. Very deep neckline. Sent back
2.0,I bought two of these. I'm not a fan. Haven't worn them at all because they look cheaply made.
2.0,Liked the look but the clasp is terrible! Fell off the first day and lost!
2.0,Lace was sewn on wrong! Would not order again.
2.0,"Cute concept but the material and cut just didn't work. When I took it out of the bag it had loose threads all over. There's no front or back to it so I just slipped it on and noticed right away that the elastic that is supposed to sit around my arms/shoulders actually stayed right above my shoulders. When I pulled it down to where it was supposed to be, my strapless bra was visible. I am 125lbs, 34C, 5'1&#34; and the S was just huge. As you can see in a couple of the pictures, the top is a little see through too. The color is really bright and the idea behind the design is there, but it just didn't live up to my expectations."
2.0,Not as pictured. Cheap fabric. The color says rose red but it's actually a very orange coral.
2.0,The lenses are bigger than I expected and the legs are very short. I did not like it at all.
2.0,"It is much baggier and bulkier than I was expecting, and it is quite thin"
2.0,"Sizing is a little big plus it stretched a bit and had to make some major adjustments. not the best quality and its startingtoshow also whatever dye/polish they used on the leather came off on all my white shirts. I feel like it's about to break were it makes a Y, hopefully not, as I solely use these for my work pants and not fashion (🚫plumbers crack🚫) some of the leather is rolling were the Y is for the back strap and can definitely feel it digging in my back, same area it's about to break at. All in all I'm happy with them but wish they were higher quality"
2.0,Not a fan of the fabric at all. And it doesn't sit well on me. Kind of big and too long. The pictures are better than the realty
2.0,The piece that did arrive is fantastic. Thinking of selling a whole piece?
2.0,"Loved them but after washing them ,they were to tight to get on :("
2.0,"I hate the design/construction of this bag. You really cannot adjust the straps due to the way it is made. Where the straps connect to the bottom shouldn't be sewn, so when adjusting we have somewhere to pushed the excess strap through. The way this bag is designed, the only place to distribute the excess straps after shortening is through the drawstring at the top. Basically, this is impossible. Also it means every time you open and close the bag you have to readjust the straps because they are no longer the same length. This means you have to open and close the top mulitiple times in effort readjust the length of the straps. The bag material is high quality, but I had to ditch the bag on my camping trip and buy another bag in town because of the straps issue. It was too much of a nuisance.<br /><br />Otherwise, the bag seems in good condition."
2.0,"I am very unhappy with this sweatshirt, When I think of sweatshirts I think cotton blend with a soft material inside. This shirt feels shiny, kind of a nylon feel to it and it is actually making my skin irritated as well!!!  I would've gotten to you sooner but I was in the U.K. and just got back a few days ago!  Anyway, I hope the seller is a decent person who will help me and i can change my rating,but for now i have to give it what i feel. Thank you, Tamre'"
2.0,"Tight in the legs loose in the waist, a bit awkward."
2.0,"too small,  I threw them away, waste of money"
2.0,"It's a cute and stylish watch, however the band broke after about a month of wear."
2.0,The necklace is cute but sadly the paint job on it is terrible…got it as a gift for somebody.
2.0,The fabric is very cheap but it holds stuff.
2.0,I’m 5”11 and the pants are like capris
2.0,very thin Hardly visible
2.0,I bought these for my son for him to use at camp. This style looked perfect but it didn’t meet our needs as the ankle opening is really big. I gave the low rating because the insole falls out every time he takes his foot out. It’s annoying and not super easy to get back in place. We’ll be ordering something different for next year.
2.0,"These PJ's are cute, nice fabric, but order a size or even 2 sizes up. They run so small!!"
2.0,"I bought these and then had to return because they were not comfortable.  Definitely not like a pillow, soft or light. Just standing up they were heavy and hard. Definitely not as advertised."
2.0,"Gloves seem well built, but ordered the large which is an inch wider than my hand measured and was still wayy small, as were the fingers. Also, the lining makes a crunching/swishing plastic sound which was not only unpleasant sounding and loud, but also seemed too stiff to allow any sort of decent dexterity."
2.0,"I had purchased a different shirt. It was too small, so I bought another shirt and increased the size.  While the colors and pattern of the shirt were nice, even buying 2 sizes up it was too small."
2.0,Loved the design! Sadly… the insignia on the front appeares to be coming off.
2.0,This set was too see through and the waist band doesn’t stretch at all. The top was cropped really short and not flattering.
2.0,"They may be somewhat Argyle but you have to look closely to see it. For the price, I should have expected what I got but I was a hopeful buyer. They're a little on the thin side, don't plan on any warmth but they are socks and will cover your foot."
2.0,I followed directions not to wipe but still foggy when you swimming.
2.0,"Very pretty and I liked them the one day they were in one piece. The little beads fell out while struggling with the big one, which is extremely difficult to put in. Maybe easier for someone with a bigger gauge, mine are 6."
2.0,There were line everywhere
2.0,Mildly water resistance. 5.5 was too big.
2.0,Paint chips quickly and lights don't turn on sometimes.
2.0,"Nope. I should have careful to READ before buying, I am not brought their reviews stories, though. Because this is MINI handbag and if you like medium or large handbag, DON'T BOTHER buy this."
2.0,The band fits my  Garmin Venu 2 barely. I think everything is good but if I flick my wrist a little too hard it falls off. Needs to be ~0.2mm wider.
2.0,"Way too small. I am a 16 and typically a XL in everything. For this to fit like the photo, I would have hard to order 2-3 sizes larger but the elastic waistband wouldn’t fit right. Cheap material as well."
2.0,Weirdly high neck
2.0,"The color (purple) was good.  But it was too, too, small. I guess I didn't read the directions that it was coming from China.  I would then have realized it was too small and gotten a larger size."
2.0,"When I purchased this swim kit, I thought swim caps were for protecting your hair from choline damage. This cap is more for keeping your hair in place. I should have known when the description said the cap was ""breathable"". It fit fine, and my hair didn't get as wet, but I don't have super long hair that I need to keep it up. The googles worked fine. The nose plugs wouldn't stay on, and felt too tight. Overall it was not what I was hoping for.<br />Updated: The goggles have completely failed as well. The seal on the left eye fell off and won't go back on.<br />Don't waste your money."
2.0,I gave it 2 stars for the color. Material is too thick and it was too big. I ordsred a medium. I returned it.
2.0,"Cute, but is not real good quality, you get what you pay for!"
2.0,Waist is high on rib cage.  I will get ri# of this mostly because I don't like the fabric.
2.0,The seamless look was nice but the pads move and fold under the inside of the lining unlike other brands I have purchased in the past. Makes me very self conscious of its noticeable.
2.0,cheap... materials.
2.0,Loved the idea but they don't really show up on glasses until the party is over and you're left scrubbing your stemware.
2.0,Ungiving material.  Its now rolled in a ball sitting in my drawer.
2.0,I ordered my grandsons  age size and he is small for his age..So order a size up.. I guess they are really small where this was designed..
2.0,"I returned these socks since  I had not known that they were handwash only. Since they are cotton, I assumed they could be machine washed, but they have some plastic on them that must be what rules them out for machine washing.  I didn't want to be bothered with hand washing.  Also, they came up higher than my rather low mocassin so they showed over the shoe. Happily, I returned them, no problem"
2.0,"I ordered this skirt in the purple and loved it so much I ordered it in the red. The size is the same, material is the same, and the color is a beutiful vibrant red. I tried it on and noticed the fit was very different from the purple one. It felt tighter around my hips and it didn't move with my body.<br />It didn't hug my hips like the purple one, but rather just went straight down. I know I haven't gained any weight since I wore the purple one 2 weeks ago so out of curiosity I layed the red on top of the purple and saw that the red is cut differently. Mind you the size is the same, but you can clearly see at least an inch difference on each side. Those two inches make a difference in the way the skirt hugs the hips.<br /><br />Please see the pictures I uploaded, same exact skirt but different color.<br /><br />I loved my purple one so much I planned on buying one in every color but now I am not sure I want to go through the hassle of returning items because of poor quality control."
2.0,woman or child-sized... or pencil neck sized
2.0,Looks like pjs
2.0,This was for my son. He loved the design but it took them forever to receive it.
2.0,"I was excited to receive this dress as I was planning to use it on a trip but ended up returning. The dress is comfy but ran a bit big and just wasn’t flattering at all. I already have a bigger, boxier frame and it made me look even bigger.<br /><br />I am 185 lbs and 5”7 and the XL was big. Maybe I should have downsized but either way I didn’t like the fit."
2.0,"This seems well made, and is super soft ! It runs small, the 8-9 fits my normally size 7 child but when she lifts her hands it shows about 3” of her tummy. The pants length was fine but the waist elastic is very tight!"
2.0,The black dress I ordered was so tight
2.0,This is probably more fit for a child. I tried to buy it for a cosplay but I cant use the kunai because they're only 2 inches long.
2.0,"Ordered a Medium based on other reviews but it was too small. Tried a bigger size but it arrived a different shade and still slightly too small. Went one more size up hoping the shade would be correct but it was the same as the 2nd. Gave up and returned. :(<br /><br />For reference, I’m 5’8” and 135 lbs.<br /><br />Photo: skirt on the left is the “olive green” I received for L/XL and skirt on the right is the “same” color in a Medium."
2.0,WARNING!!!!!!WASH BEFORE WEARING!!! I put on the mask for work for 3 hours straight. On my way to lunch I stopped by the restroom and took off the mask and was horrified to see my entire face was black!!! The maker should place a wash before wearing warning. I'm apprenhensive to wear  these even after a wash. I was very happy with the mask prior to the face painting. Very comfortable and fit well (I have a small head)
2.0,"This size chart is totally bogus. It says the waistline stretches like 10 inches when it doesn't stretch at ALL. Unless you are at the smallest end of the waist measurement range for your size, don't buy these."
2.0,"I know this is not a high quality piece, but I am very disappointed that when I received the necklace the majority of the dangle pieces at the end at already fallen off. I have only worn it twice (second time for only 3 hours now) and there are only 2 dangle pieces left on the necklace. This was a waste of money. Very disappointed because it is a pretty piece for the price."
2.0,"The colors are pretty, but the fabric is very, very thin.  I would not purchase this scarf again."
2.0,"I purchased this migaga sexy neoprene triangle bikini set push up backless beachwear for my daughter, we checked out all the sizing charts before purchasing and we received it and it was not even close to the right size.  Very very small both the tops and bottoms of this  migaga sexy neoprene triangle bikini set push up backless beachwear were probably at least 2 sizes too small. So my daughter was not able to wear it at all.  I did received this migaga sexy neoprene triangle bikini set push up backless beachwear at a discount for my honest review"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, but was looking for something a little thicker.  Granted I returned it, but didn't seem like it would last all that long either."
2.0,Could be cute but the bottom of the fabric chest area starts in the middle of my actual chest.
2.0,The style is nice but the colour is not vibrant as shown in the picture online. It is faded.<br />The only plus for me is that it came on time. I am from the Caribbean and I am left with a dress that I have paid for and cannot use.
2.0,Cheap looking and just not what I was expecting.  Maybe I ordered them to small but I didn’t like his product at all.
2.0,Broke during first use...
2.0,The outfit was adorable but on the large side.  The material was not something I would want to put on a child.  It was scratchy.
2.0,too small....its not long at all. it stops at the waste. picture is not right
2.0,These earrings are very cute and fit my 6 month great but the screw back came off of one earring on the second day! I was very disappointed. I was unable to fit a screw back from another earring onto these so I ended up ordering a replacement screw back from the company. Let's see if the backs stay on longer this time...
2.0,"Great fit, super soft. But after two washings and line drying, they developed all kinds of small holes. They are unwearable even under skirts."
2.0,ihave acrist redemer pendant but its rhodiumplated  brass wanted  something instainlesss steel that wayitwouldnt tarnish guess when  they  say  u get what  upay for13.63 down the drain may not sound  likealot to other's  but  when ur on a fixed imcome thats alot of  money to be loosing! money that could  be spent opn other things!
2.0,broke after wearing it a couple of days
2.0,"According to the size chart, a large should have fit with room to spare. I could not zip it over the chest area at all. Disappointing. Seems like a cute dress. Will probably return, although I've read in reviews the seller is difficult to deal with in that respect.<br />UPDATE: Seller will not provide full refund for return. Offered 20%. Be warned, as this appears to be an issue with seller."
2.0,For the price $8.99 it is ok dress. Don't expect to be loose/flowy flowy
2.0,"This is Horribly made, looks Horrible. The sleeves are way too short, the length is Not at all as long or ""fluffy"" I guess you could say as the photo shows. It's pretty tight fitting for a Cardigan & I have Alot of Cardigans, one of the worst ones I've purchased so this means Return ASAP! 😀"
2.0,The shirt was wide and short and the print came off in the first wash even though I washed delicate.
2.0,"Way too small and I bought the size I always buy. Additionally, the stitching popped almost immediately even though there was barely any stress on it. The fabric is also very stiff and uncomfortable."
2.0,Very cheap fabric and super wrinkled.
2.0,I ended up returning this jumpsuit it just didn't fit well overall and I also didn't know it wasnt a full pant. The pant stops just above the ankle.
2.0,This dress would have been great in a solid color. The Pattern dress just did not match up! Overall i would order a solid one and be happy
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for... only paid about a dollar. They are very light plastic. You have to handle them gently. I dropped them once and the &#34;stud&#34; broke off.. I suppose I could try to use super-glue to fix it.. but haven't done so yet.
2.0,"They came in good condition, but they're much bigger than I thought and pretty heavy for my ears."
2.0,"I love the color and the fabric. The waist fit perfectly, but was shorter than expected. It falls above the knees while standing and I am 5'6""."
2.0,This would have been 5 stars if it wasn’t for the hole from torn threading in the interior neckline. I’ll have to repair it as the seller is out of stock and I really like the product and the price point. I just happened to get a lemon which can be fixed. But I shouldn’t have to do that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a well insulated hoodie.
2.0,Very disappointed in this dress. The fabric is thin and looks cheap. The skirt is nowhere near as full as the photo. The top was too small and it is shortwaisted. I am 5'7&#34; 170lbs and the XL was small. Not the dress I want to wear to a wedding.
2.0,"pattern is gorgeous, but I ordered an XL and it was no where near even a medium"
2.0,Fits too tight in the ankle. Made me crash due to discomfort. Well made for narrow feet.
2.0,Very good product but a bit large for adult
2.0,This is a great looking item but the  Clasp keeps coming off.
2.0,Cheasey quality
2.0,The fabric is a lot cheaper than expected! I also don’t like the way it is cinched in the front! I like my shirts to cover my belly!
2.0,I ordered a 34b my boobs aren't huge. And this fits like an A cup. Material is great feels sturdy and looks better than expected but wish it would fit me.
2.0,very cheap looking. I was embarrassed to give it as a gift. Not worth 5 dollars let alone 13.
2.0,"Color was not nearly as vibrant as the pic and size ran small. If an image of qhat I actually received had been posted online, I probably wouldnt purchased. With that being said, the hoodie received does not look bad. Just not what I ordered nor does it look as good as what is posted on the amazon site."
2.0,Super cute though
2.0,In real life this does not look as nice as on the picture. I don't recommend buying it.
2.0,I didn't like the way this looked on me. It hung weirdly. I ended up donating it to a charity. Maybe someone else will like it.
2.0,"Got my pair quickly. Nice sunglasses. Problem is they don't flip up. Every time you try to flip them, they become dislodged from the glasses. Even trying to get the flip up working without being on the glasses is a no go. Disappointed."
2.0,I have ordered dresses before never had a problem. The material was a ruff clothes not a  moving material
2.0,"These &#34;fit most&#34; sizing is horribly wrong. I am a size 8.5, about as average as can be. They were very tight on my feet, scrunching up my toes. Also, where the bottom and top are sewn together is a seam that is very uncomfortable. I purchased these at a discounted price, but will be returning as they don't fit."
2.0,"I love these, but they just ripped randomly. I wear them about 1x/week for long runs, and bought them at the end of October 2017. This means that in about 8 or 9 wearings, they ripped. I was careful with them and followed care instructions too. I will update the review to see how the seller responds."
2.0,The back is so loose and unstructured that it gapes and pulls the whole dress down. Impossible to wash as well.
2.0,The sack size too big for my feet . My shoes size is 8 1/2
2.0,I bought the black color and didn't like the fabric.  Maybe other colors are better.  I don't recommend the black one.
2.0,"I had the same problem with the pin coming loose/falling out, the assembly came apart and the spring that does the ratchet got free, couldn't find it.<br />Broke on the second week."
2.0,The dress is absolutely beautiful but fits really small.
2.0,"I ordered a size larger than I normally wear, and even that was too small-I returned it."
2.0,"I ordered a medium which I always wear. Its way too small, I couldn't even get it on."
2.0,"The underwire supports won't stay in and it keeps poking me.  I took them out but without the support, the look wasn't right."
2.0,"This bag is the cutest, BUT the strap became undone and now I can’t use it."
2.0,Glasses were very faint in the blue and pink shade on the glasses. Good quality but little to no tent
2.0,These look nothing like the color shown. They are mostly clear with a very very faint blue. Needless to say I am VERY disappointed in these.
2.0,I like the idea and love the amount of things that can fit in there however the strap broke Right around the end of the return window. It's now fine to throw into my bag but is no longer the bag replacement I had hoped for
2.0,"Cheap, I guess u get what u pay for."
2.0,"They are very cute, and they do go high above your belly but I have to constantly pull them up because they keep sliding down and it makes me look like I have something hanging between my legs which makes it uncomfortable."
2.0,The dress was very pretty. The fabric was comfortable.  First day I wore it the material snagged and I have a tiny hole. I can not wear it again .
2.0,The band was comfortable & it was my favorite BUT the color wore off to white. I tried to use a permanent marker to color over the white but the ink wiped off.
2.0,"I really want to like these.  They fit well and they actually stay on (mostly).  They're super cute, too!  They're not well made, however.  The first time I wore the first pair, a hole blew out near the big toe, on the seam.  The second time, I wore another pair, and they pilled and snagged after just one use.  While the lace peeking out of your shoe is actually kind of cute, the lace is ragged and unfinished on the edges.  Overall, great idea with poor execution."
2.0,Runs very big. Print isn’t as pretty as pictured on site
2.0,"I used this to cover a steering wheel and make a shift boot for a car.<br /><br />First the pros: It's very soft, supple, and is decently workable with a good stretch.<br /><br />Now the cons:<br />* Utterly lacks durability. The surface rubs off somehow? Wheel was great when I first finished it, but quickly started showing wear. The black leather shows the gray under-surface.<br />* Mine had a weird split in the leather, such that it was almost like there were two layers.<br /><br />All in all, if you want to practice working with thinner leather, it's good, but if you're making anything significant, I would not trust this. Do not waste your precious hours with this if it's anything but practice!"
2.0,Product is ok but the color is ugly.  Showed bright bold colors not what I got very washed out colors.
2.0,"Didn't protect my eyes very well, and kept falling off my face and head!  These are more fashion over function - Looks good but  if you need protection don't go this route!"
2.0,I like the pants and the material and the way they look. They just run extremely small. And they are way too long form my vertically challenged self!
2.0,Cute but didn’t fit my ears so I had to return.
2.0,"the jewel fell out right before my mom’s ashes were to put in.  her ashes are in it now, so now i have a necklace missing a butterfly wing."
2.0,"Would like to return, but cannot teach anyone"
2.0,New out of package straps snap.
2.0,too small I will return it but overall nice shirt not made for a woman with breast
2.0,These bracelets were presents and I felt they were very cheap and could easily break.  Would not recommend purchasing them.
2.0,"The item is cute, didn't expect great quality considering the price and it is ok but I ordered an XL size and now my daughter is wearing it, my daughter wears an XS or OO... She actually likes, luckily. I'm never ever buying any clothes from China."
2.0,"Was small around my arms and was uncomfortable when raising my hands. The fit of the dress was okay, bit not flattering for my body at all."
2.0,My order arrived today but when I open the package 3 buttons were missing
2.0,Product description states they are welded however they are not. We could clearly see the gap and could pull them apart some. These will not work for us as they will be used to pull 200+lbs of weight. Will be returning them later today.
2.0,Nunca llego el producto y nunca recibí reenbolso
2.0,"The sewing is not professional. Didn't fit me, It was large."
2.0,The earrings came broken..... disappointed. It would have really been a nice set.
2.0,Not good for cancer patients
2.0,"I ordered a medium and it's way too small. Sleeves really squeezes my arms and I have very thin arms. They are charging me $12.00 to return. I get it, it's not Prime, but dang! $12.00!!!!"
2.0,Very strange cut on the waist and does not look like the picture. Disappointing.
2.0,These fit small and are not squat proof
2.0,"The color in the picture appears to be cream with soft pink flowers, however, the actual dress is bright white, with fluorescent bright colored flowers and bright green leaves.  It is not my personal style, so I am sending it back.  I thought it was more pastel, muted, and soft cream background.  Also, it does seem to run very small - if you are usually true to your size you should order up 1 size."
2.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and 125 lbs, not too big I think, but this thing just makes me look huge, nothing like the photo.  Maybe it would look nicer on a taller more slender woman.  I'm returning it."
2.0,good quality material and basic construction. no complaints about the functionality of the product. The colors that arrived were not even close to what i ordered. they take the definition of &#34;assorted&#34; to mean &#34;random&#34;. i was expecting solid colors. I got patterned buffs. if the patterns were pretty i would have been plenty happy. 3 of the patterns were acceptable to me. but i'm not a Harley Davidson fan and i don't like skull and cross bones or neon camo so half of them completely missed the mark and got donated.
2.0,"Cute, but broke taking it out of the packaging."
2.0,I'm between large and extra large normal; so I ordered a large. It doesn't even come close to fitting....
2.0,I was really excited about this dress but it is not at all like the picture. The material is super thin and holds zero shape to it.
2.0,I am a male with 11 shoe size they don't compare to Haines or other name brand socks
2.0,Doesn't fit like I expected I first ordered a medium a little too tight sent it back then ordered a large too big what the heck
2.0,"These only come up to barely above my knees, if you're over like 5'5&#34; i suspect these will be too short for you."
2.0,"I'm a bit over 5'3"" and these skirts literally dragged on the fall.  If you're not very tall they will either be sent back or you'' have to get them shortened."
2.0,It was too small. Ended up returning it.
2.0,These shorts are a bit large and baggy. They are also too long as the go over the top of my knees. The waist is very high. The material is thin. Not comfortable for exercise.
2.0,They are NOT ruby they are purple.. uploaded picture next to matching earings from same seller
2.0,"I really like the look of them, however they arrived broken and look rather cheap. I fixed them with some super glues."
2.0,These are oversized but the lens are not flat which gives you a bug like look. Not my fav at all.
2.0,Actually very nice-I expected it to be a larger tote.  Great color. Hold office files easily.
2.0,"The idea of this hat is cool. The execution was poorly done. When you wear it with the shades down, it looks weird because there is too much material on top."
2.0,"I like the style and concept, but this fits extremely tight.  I have a normal size head and this would cause a headache within a few minutes of putting it on.  I needs a longer, more adjustable velcro strap to really make it useable for more people."
2.0,really baggy nothing like the picture when its on the body
2.0,"El producto es de buena calidad, pero el tamano es demasiado grande para lo que necesito, gracias"
2.0,"No give to fabric, cheap appearance"
2.0,"There’s a really strange double layer of fabric for the hood, and the two layers are not attached together. It’s pretty uncomfortable. And the asymmetrical could pull strings look really strange. Will be returning."
2.0,Caused my finger to become infected
2.0,"I really loved the style and cut of this top, but the shoulders were tight fitting and it was hard to move in. It fit perfect everywhere else. I can only wear this shirt for short periods of time when I want to look nice, but don't plan to be very active."
2.0,Fits as expected in every way other than length.
2.0,Very small and hard to wear.
2.0,It’s basic. Nothing special
2.0,Loved the shirt design and the fabric but size ran really small.
2.0,PRETTY STURDY AND NOT BAD FOR THE MONEY BUT TOTALLY FADED AFTER 2 MONTHS.................
2.0,Cute for a cheap ring
2.0,It doesn’t fully cover stomach
2.0,"I ordered a small because I am somewhere between a size four and six. The top was loose (shelf bra with small, unattached, floating circle pads inside) and the bottoms were too small to even put on. The top and bottom were not the same size, so I am returning them. Too bad because the style is adorable!"
2.0,Quality is really bad. There is no stretch at all to this hoodie. And the color isn’t as rich as I expected from the pictures. Seems like it came from a second hand store.
2.0,They are a two piece ring and constantly are coming undone on my husbands finger
2.0,I purchased two of them. one was fine but the other one the Pearl had half a color off of it and didn't look good
2.0,The size chart made zero sense. Shoes were huge and hard. My daughter will have to wait years to wear them. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,The product was good. The only thing is that one of the prongs fell out already
2.0,"Can’t use dress.  Sizes just don’t run true to size.  Should have sent it back but to late now.  Stuck with it. Don’t buy from another country, there sizes are so different from our USA sizes."
2.0,Bad decision.  Cheap.  When I tried to set the time the stem came off.
2.0,way too small in the arms and upper body
2.0,The cut of the dress is weird.
2.0,Zipper needs to be fixed! Unzips on its own.
2.0,this dress runs small and is not very flattering.
2.0,"This item has a short hemline in front which I missed in the description,  as I am over 50 and not into trendy styles.  Overall, I like the simplicity of the dress. I wear a Med but ordered large to be sure it was long enough.  This dress still lays above ankle."
2.0,The picture is nice the dress is not.  It is very cheaply made.  I took it out of the package and my son said it looked like a trash bag.  I have to agree with him.  A very  ugly dress.  I returned it immediately.
2.0,"As other reviewers have stated the fit is large in the bust. Quite unusual for my body, typically items are snug in the bust and quite loose in the waist. This was just the opposite making the dress look strange in the chest.<br />Wasn't a huge fan of the dress material either but will work fine for a Halloween costume"
2.0,"WAY to small for the size it is suppose to be. I would order 2 sizes up if you plan to try it.  Due to the small size it would not stick as my tata's weight it down. Yes it was like taking off a band-aid, and bit harsh. But if it fit correctly I bet it would work well."
2.0,"I have a 46"" hip, so ordered 0X as chart indicated.  they turned out to be way too big. the yoke and waist measure 26"" across (52"" around), creating way too much bulk of excess fabric around the tummy when tied up to fit my 40"" waist.  geez, who wants to have a ballooned tummy?  I would suggest ordering the size that correlates to your waist size, even tho it says hip size (no waist size listed) because the waist is every bit as big as the hip.<br />the fabric is crunchy-stiff, thinner-than-a-bedsheet lightweight cotton, somewhat see-thru in white."
2.0,The fabric construction is much too light weight. Meaning it is a very loose construction were the yarns in the fabric are spaced much too far apart in order to be a good filter. Filter fabrics should not be see through.<br />I returned mine.
2.0,"The pockets pointed out and made the hip look odd shape (ok, larger).  The size was clingy in the wrong place on me.  Others may find it ok"
2.0,"I am so disappointed in this dress because it has so much potential!  The front of the dress is so cute and flattering!  Unfortunately, the back is a nightmare.  The front fits perfectly, but the back looks as if were originally sewn for another size dress: the top bit is way too loose, but the pleats are bludging at the seams.  The pleats in the front are also unraveling a bit already.  I made the mistake of handwashing it hoping that if it shrunk a little in the back it would remedy itself.  Now it looks even more ill-fitting in the back.  I had such high hopes!"
2.0,Clasp has a sharp nub of metal that protrudes and scratches my neck.  Link in the chain broke the first time I wore it.  The pendant itself is pretty though...but now I have to buy a new chain for it.
2.0,Cheap and catches on everything! You can easily scratch yourself on rough ears.
2.0,too small for 200lb+ girls
2.0,I was excited for this find for a studio 54 party I'm attending- it could definitely use a zipper- I could barley get it on and I bought a size up. It was a pretty rose gold color and I'm disappointed it ran so small.
2.0,This strap is entirely too short.
2.0,"This item is pretty that's why I bought it.  However, the thread which it was sewn with itches me and I cannot wear it.  It is also smaller than I thought it'd be"
2.0,"Not impressed. Shirts are way smaller than stated. Also, the screen print looks like it’s already been washed 50 times. Not worth the money."
2.0,Returning these - too large and uncomfortable.
2.0,"Cheaply made , lenses pop out"
2.0,Was expecting a bit more for the price. I say that because I have bought other googles for a similar price.  I bought them for a steampunk costume but ended up using my older pair. Frames were loose and there were sharp edges on the plastic and the padding fit poorly. Not at all what I was looking.<br />I will say that they arrived early which was nice but over all I was very disappointed in my order.
2.0,"This is like a thin snakeskin material. not what i was expecting  Definitely not ""faux leather"""
2.0,Way to small and the neck material is way to much
2.0,I ordered a dark blue dress and received a dress with partial black fabric and partial dark blue fabric.  It was clear that the dress was not made with one cohesive color.  Which is a shame because the dress is super cute otherwise.  And it's a little bit stretchy which makes it form-fitting yet still forgiving (flattering).
2.0,they shrink. not a good quality.
2.0,I'm fairly large in the and i couldn't  zip up as ir got stuck half way up quality of the costume was good though the sizes are more in line of Japanese sizes so two sizes smaller than  US
2.0,These didn’t fit very well on myself or my daughter. Spring was cheaply made.
2.0,Wasn’t like we thought they were took a 3 extra weeks to get to us
2.0,The advertising said a dress it is a top n skirt was not happy
2.0,I wanted to like this dress but it was too long and the seam in the back puckered. I even bought another one and it had the same defect. It would not lay flat. Returning both.
2.0,"It's pretty when you fist look at it,  but there were all these stringy things wrapped around it.  Looked closer and it was glue.  There a huge ball of glue holding the center &#34;ring&#34; up.  Really upset that I don't have time to return/exchange before my vacation today."
2.0,Cute shoes but WAY too big!
2.0,Absolutely not worth the cost. Cheap material and I’ll-fitting.
2.0,Not comfortable for me
2.0,This ring is supposed to be sterling silver but with it turning my finger a blackish green I’m highly upset with the quality of and I’d like my money back
2.0,I have a very hard time believing that this hoody is anywhere near the claimed 250 grams. If you hold it up to the light you can see through it. It wasn't warm at all in my opinion. I should have heeded the reviews I read. And the zipper is indeed on the wrong side. I am happy that they let me return it even though the tags were off.
2.0,Love the feel and fit of these leggings. Not impressed with the hole in the seam.<br />Update: After contacting the seller they responded with a nice email and a refund. I will continue to shop with this seller.
2.0,Got a few duplicates and the characters look too fake. Didn’t even receive the good characters.
2.0,"No grip, hikes up the leg and gets more in the way than the ones that clip to your socks. I now where the sock clip shirt stays everyday, love them!"
2.0,"The skirt fit fine, the fabric was just too thick/stiff.  And the length was just a little too long...I felt like a school marm."
2.0,Hinges are too loose. They flop open if you even slightly tilt your head forward.
2.0,They run super weird they are so big and I ordered my size but a plus they are super soft so I guess
2.0,"Junior's sizing?? I'm in between sizes, so I got the next size up and it was was away tight even in the shoulders. I'm a 34D and size 8 and the Medium was snug on my shoulders and my mid section was like a sausage. Colors were pretty and fabric felt nice, but I'd suggest going up 2 sizes at least if you want form fitting and more if you want it loose."
2.0,"Feels nice, but way too small. Had to return it"
2.0,"Product is pretty and seems to be of good quality. Issues is the bag it came in was inadequate for holding earrings and a necklace. One earring was loose in the shipping bag the other wasn't  there at all. So now I have 1 earring and a necklace. Not returning since I really only needed the necklace, but still disappointed."
2.0,I purchased this at the beginning of May and it did not get here till almost June. It is now the beginning of September and it has already come apart at the seams and I don't even carry it everyday. Three months of use is all it could handle. Just Sad!
2.0,I like that it helps me sweat but I have to stop a lot to adjust it when I'm working out
2.0,It did not open any easier than regular stainless steel keychains.<br />It was nap better for me.
2.0,"These masks are huge. I bought them for my son, but they are huge for him. Other than that they are fine."
2.0,"Far too short to wear comfortably. Otherwise, I was surprised at the weight of the dress and the quality seemed acceptable for the price and intended one-time use."
2.0,"Dress is cute, but it is literally transparent. I doubt I would want to try take pictures with flash on!!"
2.0,Very tight through arms and bust.  Weird boxy keyhole neckline
2.0,Okay so the bottom of this swimsuit fits perfectly. The top was a disappointment. The closure at the back was way too high up on my back and lengthening the straps did not help. All in all it just looked very weird. Maybe it just fits badly on me. It ended up giving it away. It is beautiful though and the colors are bright. Fabric is good material.
2.0,I doesn’t hang right.  When you wear it the inner picture leans into the crescent and rides up over the top of it.  So I don’t wear it.
2.0,I love these and they fit great but the bottom hem rolls up which doesn’t make them ideal for working out or being active. They’re great for lounging so I’ve kept them!
2.0,This hat was okay but was delivered smashed and it stunk something fierce like a strong fish odor.
2.0,"Nothing like the picture. Fabric is very stiff, doesn't hang loose in a relaxed fit like pictured. I usually wear a medium but got a large after reading reviews and it's so small I can't even button it still. I would suggest going up 2 sizes and expect a stiff fabric not what's pictured. On the plus side it came a lot faster than promised."
2.0,"This is a really nice bag in a beautifully muted sky blue that could have easily garnered a 5 star review HOWEVER I was first gifted this bag and it came damaged, the drama that has ensued behind this return is completely unnecessary."
2.0,glasses were tight if you have a bigger head and fit a little sideways.  The lenses are a little small so it feels like I am looking around the lenses a lot.  I bought other brands and they fit and feel better.
2.0,The proportions on this dress are strange. Doesn’t fit right at all
2.0,"I had purchased a set very similar to this in a gold color (but a different brand name).  While they were very nice and well made, I can’t say the same for these.  The silver set seems to be quite flimsy and very lightweight. One of them arrived without any type of clasp. Basically it’s just a chain.  Am I supposed to tie it around my neck? I might be able to wear a couple of the necklaces, but overall I was very disappointed. I do not recommend these. A complete waste of money."
2.0,Carrot is cute except that the back is white - not orange
2.0,Too small. There for children.
2.0,I ordered the yellow and black and loved the colors . The only problem I had was it was a little too big and the material was thin for the price.
2.0,"The skirt is made out of cotton and linen.  Difficult to wash.  It is small and it does not seem to be seamed correctly.  It is not comfortable.  Will keep just because I washed it when I received it because of an odd order.  It does not look like the skirt in pick.  The black skirt I bought was made of a different material and is great.  Thought this was made by the same Company, but apparently not.  I do not recommend buying it."
2.0,I have several Nike sports bras and so I ripped the tags off this one without trying it on.  I couldn't even pull it over my chest.  This line runs very small and doesn't have the stretch I'm used to with my other Nike bras.
2.0,"Sunglasses are nice,  but I didnt receive the case that goes with it."
2.0,I liked the size of the wristlet but didn’t like the product name printed on the front of the bag. It also was cheaply made. The lining and inside pocket ripped/ shredded after 3 days of use.
2.0,My daughter is 15 months and 36 pounds so I got her the 2-3 per the size chart and the hat is so big and the gloves are big to but not as much as the hat it. The Velcro should have been up a lot closer to the face then were it sits<br /><br />Not happy with this order
2.0,"The earrings are pretty, but smaller & flimsier than I was expecting.  Based on the quality, I think they are slightly over priced."
2.0,"I am completely disappointed over the color description of this JM Collection tunic top. I was expecting something purple Instead I received a metallic copper product. The clothing tag also indicates the colo as copper foil. The tunic color looks better on the reverse side which is an Aubergine.I ordered a 2x and it fits as expected, however it will show ALL of your lumps and bumps. So smoothing upper body shape wear is a must."
2.0,"So, it's a nice shirt, but it shrinks like crazy. I bought a large (my normal size), but it shrank. So, I bought an extra large, thinking it would shrink to my size, but NOPE. I'd say the large shrank to a small, and the extra large shrank to a medium. I probably won't try the XXL. Just going to cut my losses."
2.0,"The lenses are good color however, on the whole, these aren't much better than drugstore glasses.  Their dimensions are off, too."
2.0,"These gloves are not winter gloves, they barely keep your hands warm. They also run very tight/ a size small."
2.0,Well I loved the design. I wanted to keep them but I'm not a pro at buying boots so maybe I don't know what to look for. They were way too small so I had to send them back. I now know for pointed toe boots buy a size bigger for sure. And also don't know if they were only uncomfortable bc they were too small or if they would have felt like that even in the right size. I didn't exchange them for the right size instead I got a different pair all together
2.0,"This watch looks nice and it's nice to have a mechanical watch, but it keeps terrible, terrible time. I find myself adjusting the time every single day by a few minutes. The amount varies a lot, apparently with how tightly wound the spring is. The worst I've seen is 15 minutes lost in a day.<br /><br />Even if the speed were off a consistent amount, there's no apparent way to adjust the speed on these as they don't appear to be made to be serviceable. Basically, it looks pretty, but isn't really a good watch."
2.0,"I ordered one size larger, thinking it would run small.  It was still small.  The size chart was not helpful."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:cf5e89ddf4ec1272ad94126c7407fe18]] The pants are way too long. They are comfortable and it was a decent price.
2.0,"More of a Magenta.  We ordered this because it was purple, but the color pictured is not the same as the color we received."
2.0,Not really for adult faces but perfect for kids
2.0,Feels like a tee shirt
2.0,Not so comfy -- turns out I personally do not like 5% spandex and 95%. They're also too small.
2.0,The right shoe lights broke the 2nd day he wore them to school. Hopefully we just got a defective pair because these shoes are really cool looking.
2.0,I was immediately disappointed when I realised that the material was very inferior when it stretches and distorts the pattern when you wear it not my favourite item.
2.0,"Purchased as gift.  Great price, charm is too heavy for the chain that's included.  Spent 25 minutes taking knots out of chain as its packaged in a velvet-like drawstring bag."
2.0,"Not suitable for an adult.  Chain was too short and thin.  Would gift to a child, but easily breakable."
2.0,Beautiful color but had to return because it was too small.
2.0,"Just wanna to say, that is not a magic cloth or something, not expected result.. For the price before discount , that rip off"
2.0,"I absolutely loved it when I got it, but after a few short hours of wear it broke in two different places."
2.0,They don’t have a size listed so I assumed they were standard women’s sizing. Nope. They’re huge and would probably be a better fit for my husband.
2.0,The jeans with a boot cut should have a bit of a flare.. these are straight  leg close to skinny... not what I expected..otherwise  they are comfortable  and a good pair of jeans but I wear  boots and these would not go over them if I tried  and would look dumb
2.0,"I am a petite woman, 5’1” and this small was WAY too big. It had a man’s cut and actually fit my 5’10” boyfriend better, albeit a little short. Also, it was a thin knit and not very warm. Maybe good for summer, but I would not wear this in winter without another shirt underneath. The fabric felt nice anyway and the button construction looked sound."
2.0,"Are uncomfortable to wear. I thought if not during the day, then maybe just for bedtime, but no, they're just really made small. Great design, but falls short in fit."
2.0,"Gloves do not text, even though they say they are texting gloves, they don’t"
2.0,So long it would drag on the floor
2.0,"Bought these for my 6 year old. Selected size 6-8 years when they arrived they were so small that they were close on my 2 year old who is slim built.<br /><br />It's true to colour and pattern. Very pretty and thick, maybe too thick. Just way too small."
2.0,"I didn’t buy these because of the price. I bought them, because I can’t find any others to order! I was hoping these would work, but they’re basically THIN, easily bendable pieces of metal. Consider them thick foil. I decided to return them. I can’t sell necklaces with this low quality clasp. Search continues!!"
2.0,"They are ok for everyday use where you don't want to worry about losing or damaging expensive glasses.  However, I returned the silver color because it just didn't look good.  The shade of silver/gray could be much better."
2.0,"Looks great but material that flaps down rolls up showing underside of fabric, doesn’t make it verybattractive"
2.0,Wife bought. Read reviews and bought size according to reviews and chart. It was to small and the pads in it are terrible!!!!
2.0,"WAY OVERPRICED. NOT A SWEATER AT ALL, N WAY, VERY FLIMSY . YOU TOLD ME NOT TO RETURN IT SO I DONATED IT."
2.0,"This dress, although listed as running big, was too small on me. I ordered a 10. Quality seemed fine but customer service could use some help. They give you a label for returns but I had to pay for the shipping. Then over a week after they received my package, I still hadn't received any refund or info on the receipt of my package. Once I messaged the company, a refund was given but only $21.50 of the $69.99 cost was refunded. This has been very frustrating foe me!!"
2.0,Too big for women. Geared toward males
2.0,Be careful of these socks.  I had a bad reaction to them. I have had bamboo socks before without any problem so I question the dyes. Make your own test before buying more than one pair!
2.0,Inexpensive for a reason. Washed twice and hems & seams are falling out all over the place :(
2.0,"This item was way too small, but I didn’t realize it until we were already on vacation. It came in a nice little travel bag so that’s a plus."
2.0,Very thin material with not much to support keeping in on as a face cover. Comfortable but not the best quality.
2.0,"These slippers are very poor quality.  The back, around the black sewed or glued on sole has already fallen apart.  I would not recommend anyone to buy these slippers."
2.0,These ARE NOT fit over glasses why they are throne in with the fit over glasses be very careful when ordering and you need a printer to return it's not prime
2.0,I can't even get this over my shoulders. It was really pretty just didn't fit at all.
2.0,Their cool but way smaller than I thought the picture does not do it justice… they are actually too small for me to use
2.0,Broke the second day of wearing.
2.0,Way too large in length and girth.  I laundered according to instructions and now they would fit a child.  Unusable and a waste of money.
2.0,Look and feel cheap and lenses are way lighter than I thought... But at least the price was cheap and shipping was free so not too bummed
2.0,"Cheaply made, sizing is seriously wonky."
2.0,"They fit as expected, but stretch out while you're wearing them. The pockets are huge, but pretty loose; my keys slid out of them when I was sitting down. They also pill crazy fast, like after the first time wearing them. The colors are nice and bright though."
2.0,Thought they would last longer. They did well compared to the $10 gloves I usually get for work every 2 weeks. They maybe lasted about another week or two but once they started to deteriorate they went fast and the holes in the fingers were there. Sorry but I won't buy again.
2.0,"It's light weight. I bought this brand four years ago. The quality is not the same, disappointed."
2.0,"Okay the fit was just weird... I loved the feel of the material itself, but it looked like I was wearing badly-cut pajamas!"
2.0,Sadly way WAY too small
2.0,The top part of the dress is shorter than the display. It does not look like the same dress.
2.0,Received suit and was disappointed! Fabric quality was very cheap quality and the pants not only was missing a button but didn’t have a button hole either. I would NOT order from this company again.
2.0,Run small. Very Tight around leg holes compared to other brands in same size
2.0,i got comfortable sizing and was not stretching the material by any means but these skirts are still too see through
2.0,Not what I expected. My husband had other John Deere socks and lived them. Thick and cushiony. These were nothing like them. Thin and cheap. Will not buy again.
2.0,The dress fits nice but the pattern on the dress is totally different from what you get
2.0,big on bottom and very tight on the chest area. I wear 36C and it is too tight in my chest area and the bottom just flares out. It would be a good maternity top because that's what it looks like on. I think you need to be small chested though.
2.0,"I ordered a size small, and the leggings are still very large and to long. The leggings are nice, but the sizing is way off."
2.0,"If you are like me and have long arms you may not like this turtle neck. I’m a small medium, got a small, overall fit pretty well minus the sleeves that exposed my wrist and part of my arm."
2.0,"This looks nicer in the photo than in person. Cheap looking. Heavy, but cheap-looking."
2.0,"Everything about this set was disappointing. My granddaughter is obsessed with wolves and she loved this little set. I could not believe just how cheap it looked when I got it. I paid close to $18 for the set, but it wasn't worth $5. In fact $5 would have been a lot to pay for it. Lesson learned I guess on my part. Seems like I'm learning an awful lot of lessons with Amazon lately."
2.0,"Although this ear cuff is absolutely adorable, it does not stay where you place it.  It also is a little painful to wear because there is no ball on the end of the ear pieces to protect from irritation.  Probably will not wear as much as I do other items.  But does look cute and isexactly as pictured online."
2.0,Two stars because it does hold glasses. No more because of the low quality. Within the first week the seam holding the side in place gave way and is flapping loosely. I will not purchase this again and have question with the company that sells such a shabby item.
2.0,"These were for a costume and they were just an awkward fit. they were ok in that they were thin enough we could still maneuver our hands, but they seemed to stretch out and pull funny. if they were ever washed I could see them getting very distorted.  They were fine for the costume, but if i eve needed them for a legitimate purpose I would have been very disappointed."
2.0,it is not true to size and is NOT a sweatshirt. Company gave me a credit
2.0,"I received the glasses in a subscription box and I absolutely loved these glasses. They are comfortable, light, and stylish. Despite being form fitting and not loose on my face at all I kept them on a pair of croakies.<br /><br />So long story short, I was in Yosemite on a 6 day 45 mile hike. High altitudes, white granite, and California sun are rough on the eyes, so I took my trusted sunski's. They worked beautifully until the 3rd day. I was taking them off my face and the glue in the left arm bracket separated from the glasses.  It isn't the first time I've had  problems on the trail with equipment, so I just did what I normally do and do a backcountry repair.  Enter duct tape. I wrapped the arm and bracket with DT and continued on. Well at the end of day 4 we were heading to our campsite  and I realized they were not hanging around my neck on the croakies.<br /><br />So later on my way home I emailed the company.  They replied that their lifetime warranty doesn't cover lost lenses but they could offer me 15% off a new pair.  I can understand that a warranty shouldn't have to cover lost lenses but to lose lenses because of a manufacturing defect... it is more than a bit upsetting. And the 15% off seemed more than a bit tone deaf to the situation. Needless to say I won't purchase another pair. I wish they had better manufacturing or customer service, I'd be telling everyone about my shades,"
2.0,It's OK not what I was looking for but the get what you pay for
2.0,Feels like a nightgown not a dress
2.0,Hard to use returned
2.0,This material smell so back the my nose can’t Breath. Is the only bad thing other then that I really sweat when I run.
2.0,"I needed a particular color for my granddaughters wedding.  The size was too big , the color was off. cheap cheap cheap. no shape to it. it was like pajamas"
2.0,Cheaply made. The zipper broke after my son wore it twice.
2.0,"It was very awkward to get into with the large flap.  I returned it and chose another style.  UPS was a disaster with regard to picking up the return, but I finally prevailed."
2.0,"These are beautiful.  I bought them as gifts.  One was fine and the other came with a broken lobster claw. I was so embarrassed. If there had been quality control on the item, my rating would have been at least 4 stars. My sister will get a clasp on her own but that shouldn't be how gifts work.  The item should be perfect from the beginning."
2.0,"was pretty silent when I first got it,  a couple of weeks later and the motor has started to get loud, so much so I can't sleep with it on in my bedroom. wouldn't recommend purchasing this item."
2.0,It cute but not real
2.0,I bought the green women's open front poncho in the smallest size they had it it absolutely swallows me. I put it on a large man and it was even loose on him. The material is also extremely thin and cheap.
2.0,"Way too small. I got an XL, and I typically wear a large. Also it is more of a sweater than a blazer."
2.0,Way too big for a toddler.
2.0,stripped the screw heads. Ended up not using them
2.0,"This sweater is way too small. I have 2 other PattyBoutik sweaters in another style (size large) that fit perfect, with a little extra room to be comfy. I ordered this style in a large and it was so small I could barely even get it on. Major sizing inconsistency with this brand. I am so disappointed because I love my other 2 sweaters so I had high hopes for this one. I can't even replace it for a size up because they are sold out of extra large in the color I want, but with how small the large was I'm kind of doubting the extra large would even be big enough. For reference I'm 5'9"", 160 lbs."
2.0,"Enormous and no shape. Bought another dress from this brand that was adorable, but sent this one back."
2.0,Walmart has a spooky top hat and looks for 5.00 less and you get the same disappointment. The Amazon alternative is $70-75 or a Halloween store. I purchased this hat for a ghost tour but looks more like Im lookin to steal your lucky charms. I was unable to use this hat and had to purchase elsewhere.
2.0,"Hi,<br />This sunflower is very cheap looking.<br />It's very light weight and the chain is also very thin  and long<br />I could just snap it and it would break.<br />I spent about $22.00 dollars and it was not worth it.<br />I was so disappointed and waited awhile for this item.<br />It would cost money to ship it back .<br />I will keep the item its' a no win.<br />I would not buy this item again.<br />Elizabeth Wieder"
2.0,The stitching on the hat is crooked.. doesn’t look like the pics.. false advertisement pretty much.. but hey! We will buy anything on this stupid sight! Lol
2.0,No son tan comodos
2.0,"Loved the style, hated the material. Fit true to size."
2.0,Doesn’t really look like the the photo. Shiny leather looks fake/cheap. Crown was mashed in Shipping so it is permanently deformed. I’m disappointed.
2.0,"It does what it says, it holds tight to my baby's feet. The one problem? They are WAAAYYYY too tight. They are more like compression socks! It is insane how tight they are! I got one size above his size and they are still practically cutting off circulation on my poor 15 month old baby's feet!"
2.0,"2 out of the 3 broke the first week I got them. Originally bought them for my mom, but gave one to my grandmother. Wish they were made better."
2.0,"Unfortunately these will not stay in place.  Not sure if this is a common issue with these types of earrings but if they don't stay in place then they are just normal earrings, which I already have dozens of."
2.0,"While it was cute, it is cheaply made a broke the first day."
2.0,It is too big.
2.0,The rhinestones came off
2.0,Not worth $90.00. Cute t-shirt and fit as expected.
2.0,"Got these for my husband for Father’s Day, and unfortunately they missed the mark. The wood itself is very nice, but the clip it is adhered to renders these non functional. His tie looks askew and very awkward when using these clips, instead of laying flat and looking kempt. The search continues for the perfect tie clip!"
2.0,Product did not come with a black box or a white bag. Not as pictured. Glasses seem okay though.
2.0,Way too big and not flattering
2.0,Good but not my taste
2.0,"Too small had to return. I’m a small in pretty much everything, and the length of this body suit was no long enough.  Thanks m 5’8” would recommend a medium just for the length"
2.0,It didn’t take long for the loop that keeps the hearts on to break... as well the stones to fall out too.
2.0,They are pretty but they made my ears hurt so much after just a few hours so I can not wear them.
2.0,Band broke after only a few weeks of use. I am not happy with this at all.
2.0,I loved this band so much!! But it doesnt last long at all. I exchanged it 3 times before giving up. It looks so beautiful and was comfortable but only after a couple of wears I noticed the stones were missing one after another and then the links would break. I suppose if you only wore this band for one ot two special occasions it would last but not for every day wear.
2.0,"Bought the yellow one. Fit and color was as expected. Fabric was a light, satiny fabric with a slight sheen on surface. However it was poorly made, loose threads on buttons and the strap snapped the first time I ever wore it... in the middle of a conversation with a friend at their house. It was quite embarassing."
2.0,Pretty but it’s not latex. It’s polyester
2.0,"If you think this sweater might be sage green, per the posting photo, guess again. It is the oddest shade of seaweed green mixed with undertones of blue-grey. Quite strange and brassy. However the construction of the sweater seems decent. The color remains offputting. Seller needs to revise image and NAME rather than hide color descriptors."
2.0,"Using it to sleep in, worst buy I have ever made."
2.0,They're good quality socks but they only go mid calf. This causes them to say and they end up cutting off circulation below the calf and increasing the edema above.
2.0,"Baggy in all the wrong ways! I have to safety pin both sides of the top for it to look okay. I bought size small and I'm 5'2"" and 115 lbs.. get size small for sure! (Maybe not the best thing to spend your money on if you're a small person)"
2.0,"It is very pretty and I was very happy when I got it, unfortunately the decorations fell apart within the first use. The bow fell off 15min after I put it on and the decoration ropes within few hours. The ropes on the arms I had to pull off completely because they were just hanging there and looked really bad."
2.0,"In the listing, this looks like a hooded sweatshirt. It is actually more like a hooded shirt in that the material is thin (like a sports jersey) and not like a sweater. Therefore, it's not warm at all."
2.0,"Matte black finish is nice, except when they attempt to cover up scratches with a big brush with glossy black paint, looks like a child tried to repair it.  Fits well otherwise, would be a decent mask if it showed up in &#34;NEW&#34; condition."
2.0,"The color and fit are as expected, however the quality just isn’t there. I have a rip right in the middle of the butt area and I only wore it three times. I guess you get what you pay for"
2.0,As a face mask it’s way to tight and long.  Cut your skinny wife’s yoga pants ofF at the knee and compare:-)  thin material is great but it hugs your face and cuts off the blood flow on my skinnier then average face.
2.0,"I purchased this dress to wear for a specific occasion. It was shipped and arrived quickly. I put it on the day before to make sure it fit, it looked nice. Fit just right, and then... the sleeve tore at the seam of the back left arm. Okay. Annoyed.... but I liked it and wanted to wear it the next day, so I sewed the sleeve. Not perfect, but problem (semi) solved. I am not a seamstress, it did not look like new, but I didn't want to think of another fit. I was just gonna go with it. I put it on the next day to wear and I looked and there was another tear on the front left sleeve. The sleeves were not too tight, the dress fit nicely. I do not understand the tears in the sleeve. I did not have time to sew this new seam hole, so I tossed on a jacket and went on with my day. It's October, I knew I was gonna be outside. The forecast says high 60- low 70s, I will be okay. But I wasn't okay. It was warm as heck!! I wanted, desperately, to take my jacket off and couldn't. It was annoying. I did like the dress. I did feel cute, but I was hot and the dress has holes. The first sew job was bad and unimpressive, I dare not try again on the second sleeve. It got one wear and I can never wear it again. :("
2.0,"Cheap, not worth the value. The material is cheap and feels awe full. The sewing job is horrible."
2.0,I didn't like this dress at all
2.0,"Sizing was all sorts of off. I am 5'7"" about 140 lbs. I ordered a small and it was baggy and short. My legs are longer and the bottom of my dress was probably hitting right below mid thigh. I wouldn't be able to bend over without holding the dress behind. Dress is also see through. I didn't want to deal with returning so I gave it to my mom who is 5'1"". You could probably wear this dress with leggings and a belt and get a better result than me. The dress just doesn't look as good as on the picture."
2.0,"Not as advertised ... This kaftan as an awkward shape and cut! I ordered the white and black one, you will have to make alterations. It's cute but doesn't hang at all like it does on the model."
2.0,Torso too short and sleeves too long
2.0,"I've never had a problem with stainless steel 16G hoops before, but something about this one irritated my skin and was very uncomfortable to wear. I had it in my upper ear lobe for reference. I normally wear 16-18G hoops there and was looking for something a little more decorative. I had a 16G in there so figured this would go in without a problem, but my ear was red, swollen and itchy until I took it out. It's cute and seems well-made, but I have never had sensitivity issues before this piece. Use caution if you have metal allergies or sensitivities."
2.0,This product runs so so small.
2.0,Material; way too thin for my liking
2.0,"It's a very cute suit, but it was both too tight and too long for my daughter who is just now growing into 4Ts.  It might work on a tall, very skinny child, but not for an average-sized preschooler."
2.0,It's not polarizing. The style is nice. But I really wanted the polarizing.
2.0,Dress is very hard to return due to fit
2.0,Inside bottom of the shoe came out after being worn once
2.0,The chain keeping it together broke not two hours after wearing it for the first time. All I was doing was grocery shopping and it couldn't hold up to that D:<br />It's sad too because the product itself looks very pretty
2.0,"I really wanted to love these pants. I love the color and the stripes at the knee. However, as soon as I put them on I noticed a run going from the crotch area up the back, also there was thread coming unraveled. They are squat proof if you are worried about the back of the pants being too low however they are somewhat see thru so in certain light, if you bend at all you can see your crack through the pants. I would order another pair but I think the fabric is the problem, just too thin and prone to runs and tearing. So sad!!"
2.0,"Not the nicer quality as pictured, overpriced. Comfortable but shorter than indicated."
2.0,Stitches started to open in just 2nd wash
2.0,"The suitcases seem to be of decent quality, and are lightweight. The largest of the three, however was missing one of it's side-standing legs (picture attached). A hole in the internal box (within the Amazon box) seems to show it punctured the box before coming off.<br /><br />The internals of the suitcases are nice, and the horizontal divider is a nice touch. Would recommend if not for the damage."
2.0,Product from China...way small and I ordered a 2x.
2.0,Perfect color but incredibly flimsy. Bend when you are trying to open and/close them. Disappointed.
2.0,Super cheap looking I had to return them
2.0,Too big.  They kept falling off my head when I leaned forward.  Returned
2.0,sent it back--too small and thin material
2.0,"I loved this necklace for about 2 weeks, then it tarnished."
2.0,It was too baggy in the crotch
2.0,These are pretty but much smaller than the picture. I will give them to my teenage granddaughter to wear when she gets older.
2.0,"The skeleton print is off. The leg bones only go to the knees. It's quite unflattering and awkwardly fitted, loose in some parts, tight on others. I usually wear size S so I was surprised that it was so weird. Pretty disappointed for this costume."
2.0,sizing is wrong.
2.0,"M does not fit like an 8-10 more like a 4-6 so I would suggest ordering up a size. Material is almost like an active wear material which could be nice but I think it's going to be very see through. Tried it on quick and it looks only remotely like the dress pictured, it's a good couple of inches shorter, and the waist is an empire waist rather than what is shown. I could only try it on breifly before I had to take it off and put it in the laundry because straight out of the package it smelled terrible (almost like vomit) the dress was clean but something during the packaging must have gone wrong because that was a horrible smell.<br /><br />It's not the worst Amazon dress I've bought and I will still wear it, but I am a bit dissapointed that it was not the dress pictured.<br /><br />Update: I ordered this dress in both black and red. Unlike the black the red is: made out of a nice soft material, was not see through, did not have a horrible smell out of the packaging, and was also true to size and fit much better than the black (which was way smaller than normal medium) I was so worried that I wasted my money by buying ordering two dresses like the black one, but was pleasantly surprised that the red dress was a much better quality."
2.0,"I know I was drawn to it because it's cheap but in this instance you really do get what you pay for and it;s honestly not worth it. it's made up of rayon and polyester, no cotton, and feels like a plastic bag. Evidently it looks like i'm wearing a plastic bag too. Just not good."
2.0,I would love to give this an all around 5 star review but for this price and not coming with a battery is crazy. I had to spend an additional $150 to buy a battery and charger.
2.0,I was very disappointed as the lenses were tinted and had a brand name applied to the lenses and just would not come off
2.0,"I really liked them, but the ball fell off one of them the first time I wore them."
2.0,"Neck opening too big, making shoulders too narrow. ""Bodycon"" is just another way of saying the thing is too tight. Just because fabric stretches over something doesn't mean it should.  Shows every bulge, crease, and bump.  I like the way the bottom flows, but the top is too tight, especially the sleeves and bust."
2.0,"* if you put 2 coats of clear nail polish around the inside, it wont turn your finger green.. if you have it in water a lot, reapply every couple of weeks.."
2.0,One of the stones was crooked. The color was more coral than rose gold.
2.0,Would not shape into a circle
2.0,"Protects well from the sun until it tears up. Worked very well on a kayak. As soon as I got on a boat, the snaps ripped from the wind and I now have a flimsy-brimmed hat without the face or neck flaps."
2.0,"I am giving this two stars because I do actually like the bag. However, after one week of use the cross body strap broke on both ends. I have emailed the company to see if they could do anything about it, but still haven't heard back. It's unfortunate as I purchase the bag for $60 on another website."
2.0,The description says engraved this was not!! Instead it appears as if it was painted on it was heavy but thw writing can easily be wiped off.
2.0,Fades first time after washing
2.0,Super cute but the arm and chest part are WAY to small. I even bought a bigger size than I normally do.
2.0,I bought to use on a Mission leather belt.  This buckle will not work on Mission Belts 40mm. The leather is very cheap and flimsy compared to Mission Belt.  Wish I could return it.  Nowhere near the quality of Mission Belt.
2.0,Not quite like the photo...  shorter and a bit smaller..
2.0,Just got this today and put it on my brand new Fit bit Versa. The pin broke and now I cannot remove the band from watch. Poor quality
2.0,Only came with 1.
2.0,"I ordered the burgundy sweater. The listing did well to explain that it would be oversized and it certainly was. I'm 5'4, 140 lbs and it almost reaches my knees. Lastly, the one I received wasn't a v-neck as depicted."
2.0,"Cute dress, I have a smaller bust so it’s very open. I will have to have a clasp added to keep my chest decently covered. Also, I ordered this in green. The pictures show white flowers, mine has pink flowers which I’m not thrilled about."
2.0,The fit was not as expected through the width.
2.0,"5'7""<br />170 pounds<br />34DD<br />Waist 26""<br />Hips 43""<br />Ordered pink in Large<br />Soft velvety fabric, very stretchy, also seethrough.<br />Fit like a glove but due to wide hips it is short and slides up as I walk. Maybe ordering XL would fix the fit around hips but then top would also get too large.<br />Sadly, returning."
2.0,beautiful but foot too swollen to wear.  Small size
2.0,My husband does have a small head but when he pulled it gently to make it smaller it snaped.  So kuch fot that product
2.0,Loved the style of the dress but when it came in the material is very thin and flimsy. The edges are unraveling a bit and it didn't hold up well to one washing. More of a swimsuit cover.
2.0,Not the same size as described
2.0,"Way to small for my son. The words o. The hands are also to small to read,no point."
2.0,"I did not like the material, it’s some kind of polyester instead of cotton. I would expect baby clothes to be made of Cotten. My bad for not checking closer. Also instead of snaps at the closer on  the bottom there is 2 small buttons that are hard to bottom. I can only imagine how hard it will be when trying to do it with a squirming baby."
2.0,I wish it had more stability in the structure. The bottom rolls up. Very disappointing...
2.0,Poor quality wallet you get what you pay for
2.0,This cape is supposed to catch the hair. It is not curved like in the picture. It had elastic bands on the edge that makes it stick straight out. I wanted to use it for a bed ridden family member but it made the process cumbersome instead of helping.
2.0,Very soft but fall apart after 1 wash and wear.  Would work great as disposable socks.
2.0,I was very disappointed in these earrings. The picture makes it look like they are made opposite ways.  My pair has the cats pointing the same way so when I put them on one cat is facing back and one forwards. I wanted the cats facing the front.  This is always something that drives me crazy with earrings. They are very light weight which is great but my mistake for ordering black earrings when I have long black hair. You can’t see them.  They were a total fail for me.
2.0,SOME DRESS
2.0,"Love the size and color, but the zipper never lasted for more than three openings.  Sad."
2.0,"The drop (waist to crotch) is TOO short, not a regular fit.  These shorts sit below the waist pushing other stuff up.  Front pockets are also very shallow - my iPhone sticks out."
2.0,Too small. I will need to lose some weight to fit in this shirt...LOL
2.0,"I have purchased Bryan Anthony products from Amazon before with no issue, but this time the necklace did NOT come with the meaning card or the pouch. It came in a zip lock baggie. Disappointed as this was a gift and I got it for the meaning card. 😔"
2.0,Colors were pretty. Didn't like the fit and the material was messy. Returned.
2.0,The shirt arrived today. I'm a little dude and rock XS. I ordered the XS but it fits like a Medium. The sleeves are also quite wide and awkward looking. The shirt took forever to arrive.
2.0,Not a fan on these earring. Not meant for normal ear holes. But they're decent. I can't wear them. They don't fit in a  normal ear hole.
2.0,My boyfriend loves it but the front eagle fell off pretty quickly.
2.0,"Well made, but siized for children, not for adults."
2.0,Not very easy to figure out how to wear
2.0,"I got the same dress, in the same size from a different store and they each fit very differently. So perhaps there is a lot of variation in sizes with this dress. The green was not as dark as it looked in the picture either. It looked a bit more washed out in real life but I would have still liked it if it fit correctly"
2.0,"I love a beautiful sheer dress, so I was excited to receive this and see how I could style it. Unfortunately, this dress is constructed in an extremely odd way. There is so much fabric in the front that it creates a very unattractive bunch over the bust. The back has really thick ugly seams connecting both sides and the bottom, connecting in a sort of crossover the back panel which should be sheer and lovely but isn't. The concept of this dress is lovely but the execution is terrible. for the price, I did not expect anything extremely high-quality, but the dress still needs to be attractive and wearable; I did not feel that it was. One positive I can give to this dress is that it does seem to be sized appropriately. I am 5'4 & 115lbs and ordered a small."
2.0,"I got these to wear around the house and pool. They are the most comfortable lounge type pants I've ever had. Lightweight but what seems to be quality cotton, you can tie the legs loose and get air flow down on your calves (these are the shorter, single side tie pirate type pantaloons) They dont drop off your waist and the waistband doesn't roll like many sweats do. I'm going to wash and wear these for a while and if I still like then I'm buying a dozen more (scratch that, these are EXTREMELY FLIMSY and one week of wearing them around the house and then on one trip to the supermarket the butt split wide open as I got into and out of a car. Fortunately it was as we got home! The cotton is so weak as to be virtually rotten, could be a real embarrassment if you are at a costume party or public area"
2.0,"The part that covers the chest here is so low and I have 40DDD. From my pictures you cant tell how bad it looks but ita not an attractive low cut it just looks bad. I am 5'6"" and 180 with most my weight in my arms and chest but yet that was where the dress was too big"
2.0,WAY too big. An XL would fit a size 14+ easily. I ignored previous reviews on sizing and went with what Darn Tough recommended. MISTAKE. I'm a size 12 and these are way too big. They are very thin but look to be durable. Don't expect any extra cushioning. Wish I had gotten a Size L to see how they will wear. XL too big and won't wear.
2.0,Too small.  Medium is only kid's size 5...Large is only kid's size 6!
2.0,"It's stunning but way too short. Ordered a small, am 5'4&#34;, 125lbs. Band fit well but again way too short. Ordered a medium the second time in hopes of it being longer, and it was about the same. Also the band doesn't reflect the size. Size is just the length and that band is TIGHT. It's gorgeous but again was hoping it would touch the floor."
2.0,Not my expectations!
2.0,The arms broke off after not even one complete use.
2.0,"Very pretty style and fit as expected.  Not very good quality, but it will have to work.  Both buttons popped off.  One area of the hem didn't get sewn which resulted in a raw edge approximately 2 inches long.  Not an item that I would normally keep but I don't have time to find something else for the event as it is too close."
2.0,Did not like them at all.  pants are not cut right.  It made me look like I had an addition 100 pound's. Not flattering at all.  Tried them on and took them right off. My husband said it looked like a clown suit with out the colors. I am 5'5 and 163 pds.  I really wanted them to work because of the reviews concerning hot flashes and how soft an airy they are.  Never got that far. Disappointed.
2.0,I really wanted to like this dress but I just couldn’t. The material was lame and it’s definitely not designed for the ladies who have to wear bras. Zero bra coverage possible with this dress so I ended up returning it.
2.0,It’s cute but NOT sweatshirt material 😔
2.0,It’s a cute necklace but not worth the money spent. It came very dingy looking and almost dirty. Not happy with the quality and never wore it. I can’t believe I paid so much for this. Lessons learned.....
2.0,One broke as I was putting it away!
2.0,It was not made right. the bottom of the shirt was cut way too narrow for an x-large
2.0,"They tear very easy, but good to wear in the grocery store."
2.0,This did not fit correct. Some places were too big and then it was too short.
2.0,Nice chain very well made but does not fit pandora bracelets
2.0,Not as expected. Baggy. Cut is not flattering at all. Adding a belt in desperation only made it worse. I returned it.
2.0,Dress was way to small.
2.0,"It's not actually made by urban coco as described in description.  That material is very slippery and muggy feeling, not what you want in a cover up."
2.0,"This romper is cute, but runs really small. I am kind of in between a small and a medium currently and I ordered a medium and it was definitely too small. I would’ve loved to replace it with the correct size but it is no longer the same price. Super cute but better luck next time."
2.0,"Unfortunately, these weren't as expected and two pair arrived broken. I liked the design online but not in person. I wouldn't purchase this product again."
2.0,"Will possibly scratch my glasses, will not use."
2.0,Second time ordering to include with my clients closing gift but only received one this time. Supposed to get two. Required me to go return the one key chain just to get a correct order. So started ordering from a different place which has been great so far.
2.0,Its thin and cheaply made
2.0,I loved the anklet when I received it and it appeared to be of good quality however after only 4 weeks it fell apart and can’t be repaired.  Disappointed.
2.0,Very sad because the lanyard looks great.. but the snaps in the back don't hold at all and it simply falls off of my neck. Every other part of the lanyard is great.
2.0,"This is one size, but it's pretty large. It's cute and I like the tassels, but they began to unravel the very first time I wore it. I've trimmed the tassels a few times since - I guess it looks okay. It was inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting much. This isn't the kind of item you'll use more than a season, if that. I wouldn't purchase this again. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
2.0,They look great when they are in but they aren't made very sturdy and the back broke off one of mine after only wearing it twice. I was always careful while putting them in so my advice is to watch how you handle them.
2.0,"The color is NOT like the picture lol! It’s cute, but it is a BRIGHT neon orange - not this peach color as shown in the photo. It fits well though and my body looks good - just way too bright."
2.0,"The piece looks nice, but the clasp is a bad design. Perhaps it's because I have small wrists, but it constantly falls off. For a while I tried tying it together, but I eventually gave up and don't wear it anymore."
2.0,I was not completely satisfied on onebshoe the band that goes between the toes is sown into the shoe sideways and it makes it really painful to walk.
2.0,"I loved these glasses, they were super cute and lightweight but they snapped. Didn’t even have them for a month. 😭"
2.0,I got these a few days been wearing them .... all the rose gold came off their now silver. Lol!  I would not purchase again.
2.0,Like that it didn't fog and its light weight and easy to clean. Not like that its very uncomfortable hind my ears
2.0,The quality was not worth the cost. Returned.
2.0,"I followed the size chart. I'm a 14 and got a xl but it fit like a medium, no bigger size available. Cute coat, took awhile to get to me. I liked that the fur was removable."
2.0,I had such a headache wearing this hat all day at the beach. At one point I was going to take it off and allow my face to get scorched and freckled by the sun! The hat is too heavy and the brim too big. Not good in a windy or breezy day. It was like I was wearing a parachute around my head and couldn’t control which direction the wind was taking it. The quality is pretty good so two stars for that.
2.0,These tights are not true to size .  They are 3 to 4 sizes smaller than the label size.
2.0,Broken button. Wasn’t able to wear properly. It felt nice though
2.0,"The overall length of the top is too short, even with the straps at their longest. The cups do not sit down over the breast and do not stay in place. There is no waist band of any sort to keep the cups in place and they are too high up in the top. Sadly not usable at all. Nice material."
2.0,its very cute but its way to big for my head  maybe if my head was huge but i think my head is normal size lol
2.0,Cheaply made. Ripping in the shoulder already and haven't even worn the product besides to try on. It is very roomy and comfortable from the little bit I wore it.
2.0,Runs small. Started fraying with first wash in cold water.
2.0,HAD TO EXCHANGE FOR LARGER SIZE
2.0,Cheap quality and not really comfortable. Although the pink color is really cute.
2.0,"the magnet is not strong at all. it falls off constantly, and now i’ve had two that have broken at the clip near the apple watch face :( so cute but needs to be better quality"
2.0,I loved the ring but it changed color fast. I guess with the sanitizer and washing hand it got black.
2.0,"Kind of has a renniasiance feel to the dress... very flattering and would fit many body types. The yellow is BRIGHT yellow. The skirt is completely see through, but they do give you a pair of bright yellow underwear to wear.... But, this is gonna totally make for a great Halloween costume when I add some pants and do a modern day belle for Beauty and the Beast theme."
2.0,Too small like they are defective
2.0,"I have many different filson products, and I am not sure what was going on with this fleece. It was obvious as soon as I got it, someone has tried it on before too and thought the same about it- the whole thing was much too small for a large, it was more of a size small. I almost couldn’t get it over my shoulders."
2.0,The two with larger holes (net) ones fell apart after one full day of wearing. I ended up having to throw them away.  But I do/did love them other than that.
2.0,"[[ASIN:B012LLKDDE Rockin Footwear Kid's Aqua Fire Rubber Water Shoe (12, Black/Yellow)]]  This are really good looking shoes but unfortunately they don't hold up well.  My grandson has only worn these twice in the pool and the right insole has come out.  Also the sole of one of the shoes is starting to fray.  If you do buy these I recommend buying one shoe size smaller than your normal size.  I will be buying a different water shoe for him."
2.0,"They look and feel nice, but they are very itchy to wear, I have to return them."
2.0,gets tangled in clothes
2.0,"Very pretty dress, but cheesy material. Need to wear something underneath, buttons didn't close right. Returned"
2.0,Pants are really small around the waist and long.
2.0,"Sizes run really small, and frankly, without any bra support at all you had better have the body of a super model to feel comfortable!"
2.0,&#34;Runs small&#34; is an understatement.
2.0,It looks cute and keeps my daughter's toes warm but the ankle is too small and the soles are too long so the boots don't stay on very long.
2.0,"I’ve had these boots for not quite 2 months and I love these boots but sadly the little metal stars come off.  As you can see by photos, looks as if one came off before shipped but was replaced by a little stud.  I have glued one back on, one came off at some time and I was unable to find it.  I contacted Boot Barn, unable to return for replacement because I tried reattaching one with glue.  I hope no others come off, I love these boots.  Because of cost, I wouldn’t think this would be a problem.  Boot Barn came me a 15% discount refund but I would  prefer boots that won’t fall apart.  I will take mine to local repair shop to have studs inserted where stars have fallen off. 😕😕😕."
2.0,I think that it's BS that this is advertised as a classic 80s horror hoodie when 1. The original It came out in 1990 and 2. That is not Tim Curry who was the ORIGINAL pennywise.
2.0,I really wanted to like this dress.  It was just too big in the top and just had a funny fit all around.  I was glad that they were able to return and receive a refund.
2.0,Does not fit as expected and they have no bigger sizes
2.0,The black one purchased came with a wide padded waist belt and nice knife holder.<br />Material is super heavy -- i expect it to hold up well.<br />The pack is single stitched making long term durability a concern.<br />The zippers are complete garbage (see photos)<br />The pull cords pull right off the zipper with little effort.<br />I will attempt to bend the tab down to keep pulls on but fear they'll just break if cast type material.
2.0,Bought this for my 8 year old and wouldn’t recommend. I would have returned if it wasn’t for an event the next day. It is short and very wide.
2.0,This happened at less than 2 months old. 😔
2.0,Huge and disgusting logo.  There is this ugly red stitching that sticks out so badly on the shoulders and waist.  Like literally some designer must have some serious issues if they thought that would look good.  It does fit nice and the color looks really good but definitely returning this still.
2.0,This leaves little black fuzzy all over everything. I would not order this product again
2.0,Was to small for my husband's head had to give to my grandson who's 4yrs old
2.0,Was too small but dealer made right. Good dealer!
2.0,Too large for my face reminds me of a circus clown glassex
2.0,"Its literally 2 little ""pads"" (if I can even call them that) with a stick side....not impressed. Should be thicker and higher quality for the price"
2.0,"Too big and unflattering. Haven’t worn it out of the house yet, after owning it for 6 months."
2.0,"I didn't receive the 2nd nose warmer as mentioned during my purchase. The one I received worked great breathing out but froze my nose while breathing in. If it had small nostril holes, maybe that would've helped because I have a standard/regular sized nose. I really wanted the ""nose sweater"" to help, well, on to the next thing, if there is one...."
2.0,"This is cute, but way too big,  I am 115 lbs, 5'5, 34 A bust and the smallest size was huge.  Very loose through the arms, chest, and waist.  Wish they carried even smaller sizes :("
2.0,There is no v neck. It is a little misleading
2.0,Worked great for about a month and a half then quit working.
2.0,I ordered 00g and it was extremely small for my gauges.
2.0,"I didn't realize how ""low"" the high-low is on this one--the tail came down below my rear end. Couldn't possibly have been tucked in. Fabric was a little scratchy. It's cute enough for the price if this is what you're looking for. I returned it."
2.0,Have had the bag a week:  Very pretty & true to color posted.  Perfect size & with the smaller crossbody bag - it'll be great for our trip we have planned.  My only worry is the seemingly cheaper material used for inside the bags.  It appears like it will be easy to tear in the future.  Otherwise it would be a 4-5 star❗Update:  Interior material just tore yesterday & I missed my return window by 3 Days.  Star now = 2
2.0,Beautiful at first. Daily wear had it lose its crystals after 3 months.
2.0,"the glasses is big and i like it, but...<br />the low edge of plastic glasses touches skin of nose and can scratch it, because it is sharp. so infection can come in body<br />besides my glasses had a little color defect on glass, so i returned ."
2.0,This wallet is wayyyyyy to big. Couldn't fit in my pockets in any of my pants. Too bulky.
2.0,"Some of the bones had paper on them and when I took the paper off it removed some of the paint. The torso of this jumpsuit is very short, I'm 5'2&#34; and well proportioned, but the pelvic bones came to my navel and the patella was on my thighs. It's an ok costume."
2.0,Not as simple as OEM version
2.0,"I'm 5'7"", have broad shoulders and wear 36C. The fit was unflattering on me and looked like a maternity dress. If you're looking for an actual maternity dress, the fabric is very soft against the skin."
2.0,I just got these in the mail. They cane right on time but they are a bit smaller that I thought for a cartilage ring. I’ve had troubles getting one in.
2.0,"It comes with only a single pin to hold it on. It needs two, as it just spins and bounces around when you walk. It only looks okay if you aren’t moving."
2.0,"Ill fitting. Runs very large even though I bought a size down. I thought it might be thin and cheap material, so I bought black instead of a lighter color. Still you can see bra through it. I like the ruffle detail and that is it. Returning."
2.0,what a disappointment
2.0,I'm on the smaller size of US 16 😉 However this dress material is way to heavy. When trying on I felt like it added an extra 15 pounds I was carrying. I give it 2 stars for the color is beautiful and the style is nice.
2.0,"Quality material but so tiny! Tiny silver chains. Tiny silver balls. Of course, without any kind of stoppers for the silver balls, they all get pulled to the bottom of the wrist so they're not visible at the top. Well, that kind of defeats the entire purpose. Very poor design."
2.0,Cute but looks inexpensive
2.0,The color of the dress was as expected. I ordered a size large and the bottom of the dress was just above my knees (I am 5’9 in height). Material is of good quality however it was not sewn properly. I took the dress off to add an undershirt and when I put it back on the top part of the dress split straight across my left breast. If the dress was sewn properly and wouldn’t have ripped I would have given 5 stars.
2.0,"The color was what i expected it was a bright pink,and it ran real small........"
2.0,"The description of product said it fits size 5'2"" to 6'. I am 5'4"" and it was at least 4 inches too short. I will be sending back."
2.0,The gown is a little too big but I kept it because did not want to go through process of returning. The material is of poor quality also.
2.0,"The owl is adorable.  I bought 2 of them.  One for me and one for my bestie.  My chain broke literally about an hour after I put it on.  But for the price, who can complain.  I do LOVE the owl though."
2.0,"I loved the look of this watch and gave it as a gift to my adult daughter for her birthday because she's always been a Wonder Woman fan. Within a week of wearing the back came off because the pins were too short. It was one week past the ship back date for Amazon so now I'll try to find a jewelry store that has longer pins to keep the back on this watch. This watch is fun, cute and colorful but poorly made."
2.0,"Not what I expected, it was too big and bulky.  Thought it was the size of a small wallet, instead it is the size of a small purse."
2.0,"Had to use rubber backs to keep them on, but pretty."
2.0,"Poor quality, very flimsy. They look cheap in person . Bought as a gift, would not buy again"
2.0,Nice but not large enough to fit my hair.
2.0,"Waist trainer was great at first, but after just 1 week the velcro no longer sticks on one side only. The whole point is to be able to pull it to make it tighter.  Now its useless. The arm and leg bands rub against other areas, and make using them very uncomfortable.  Wasted $$."
2.0,Small and short- I will have to wear it as a shirt- also I ordered the dark purple- it's more like purple-
2.0,Not for the big busted
2.0,"Hat fits great and quality is good but it has &#34;flexfit&#34; emblazoned on the underside of the bill, something that wasn't advertised or shown. That was quite disappointing and I wouldn't have purchased the hat had I know that fact."
2.0,"I had decent hopes for this dress.  I knew that it would be a cheaply made dress, but I wasn’t expecting such surprising low quality.  The fabric feels like parachute material.  The seams are misshapen on almost every part of the dress.  The bodice puckers out at the sides.  The gathered waist is actually just folded over on one spot just off from the center.  Very obvious.  It looks like it was sewed by a middle school home ec class. I was hoping to wear this without a bra, but the lace does not hide anything.  I don’t know why it has a zipper on the back considering the ruching.  Cute style, but if you are looking for quality, spend a little more on something else."
2.0,"Cheap material sent back a sit is the kind of polyester that if you stretch it, it turns white. Not as pictured as skirt is not as full, and it looks very cheap and you need a slip underneath as it is see through."
2.0,"it is well constructed and exactly as it appears in the picture.  It is just made for an alien head and not a human.  the other L/XL hat i bought fit perfectly.  This one..... well my wife suggested i could keep my keys, phone or wallet under my hat if i needed to put them somewhere at the beach"
2.0,"My main issue for returning this product is that the white print on the onesie and the white stripes on the pants appear to be pink. The item does run large. I ordered down a size based on others reviews, but the item would still be too large for my baby. Shame because the reindeer on the bum is really cute."
2.0,"Was too small for my 14 years old i gave them to my younger son 11 years old and still too small.<br /><br />My kids are skinny and average build so you really need to order 4 sizes up to get tge right one, as it is its not even close."
2.0,"This a nice large bag, perfect for a day at the pool or beach. The fabric quality is good and it is definitely water resistant. When I say it is large, my six year old daughter could fit in it... It's definitely very big. The issue we ran into was with the zipper function and the stitching quality at the seams by the zipper. On about day 3 of our vacation to Hawaii, the tab at the end of the zipper run popped off while we were closing the bag. The next day, the entire stitching fell apart where the tab was and shortly after that the zipper pull fell off and was lost; rendering the bag basically useless since you could not close your belongings within in it any longer. The bag is really nice and I would have given it 5 stars had the zipper function held up. Unfortunately, I will be returning this bag and I'm skeptical to replace it with one just like it."
2.0,Its just okay. Decent looking bag EXCEPT for the 20 rhinestones imbedded in the gold bars across the top and the large rhinestones on the 4 tips along the zipper. Makes it look cheap. The company didnt want me to send back because it's in China but gave me a 20% refund. If you want a church bag this is for you. Not for everyday. Will carry it eventually.
2.0,It’s felt. Would be appropriate on a stuffed beer or a child but not professional on an adult.
2.0,"This bracelet could be found in a quarter toy machine.  Doesn't look handmade,  is very cheep.  I am disappointed, too say the least."
2.0,It sucked so bad! sizing was offfffffffffff!
2.0,After 3 washes the graphics came off the hoodie
2.0,It runs large.
2.0,"This wig is very thin,and when i opened it,it was a huge tangled mess,also the bangs weren't cut,but i expected that..but what i didn't expect was for the bangs to be the same length as the normal hair?..It took a while to style because i had to actually make bangs,like they weren't at least to my chin.no i had to cut from the long hair,so that made the wig even THINNER! I ended up straightening it,and that made it soft..but if your not good at styling and don't want to have to modify anything..don't buy..it was a BAD wig..sorry."
2.0,Ordered 9.5 for my son fit more like an 11.
2.0,Doesn't look well on.  The hood is pointed so looks a little like a costume...  I kept though and wore it once in the winter.  It was OK.
2.0,"Way to ""hard"" of a bag to use.. you could seriously hurt someone with it!"
2.0,Nice material but way to small. Orderd the large and it fit more like a small. It was not long or more loose like the photo shows
2.0,Fit seems to be good but the material is pretty thick for an active wear and it is very itchy. Returning this item..
2.0,"This hoodie sweatshirt is pretty ugly and is way too large in the shoulders and chest area.  It doesn't fit at all as the pictures indicate as it's actually much broader in the shoulder area.  This sweatshirt is best for a very barrel chested individual as it is proportional length wise, just not width size.  It is quite warm and soft so if you are just looking for a comfort sweatshirt to wear around the house, this would work well.  It didn't shrink much in the wash but it looks like it's pretty poor quality and won't hold up well over the long run."
2.0,"I'm 5'8 and 135lbs. and the size medium was too wide and the sleeves were too short. I ordered this identical item from another brand, similar price point and the fit was spot on."
2.0,Slimmer than pictured.
2.0,love the dress look just like the picture. no complians except I never received the deattachable booarch and i would love to have it
2.0,Shoe is very small for a women’s size 10. So small that my toes were showing through the shoe fabric. Had to return.
2.0,"The clasp doesnt stay closed. Disappointed- if we loosen them so it will stay closed, then the goggles arent tight enough to keep the water out. Wouldnt reccomend"
2.0,Top fit great but the bottoms were easily two sizes too small
2.0,"I was instantly in love with these earings.  They are adorable - just as pictured.  I wore them for a day and both cats broke off the plugs.  If it had just been one, I might have considered it a fluke, but because it happened to both, it is clear that these are very poorly made.  Luckily, I noticed right away when they popped off and saved them.  I loved them too much to just throw them away so I cleaned off the poor quality glue they used and later bought some metal glue to reattach them.  It was worth the effort as they are so stinking cute, but I can't recommend buying these."
2.0,"This product comes in a EURO size and a USA size, but they don’t say that. I ordered XL, but they came in a EURO large."
2.0,"Small, small, small.<br />I got extra large, got small, small, small.<br />Who measures these things? Plus size should be plus size."
2.0,Fit cute- material looked like the fireproof childrens pjs!!!  Horrible horrible sewing.. lines were very wonky.
2.0,"Fabric is nice, it is well made.  I like the color. But -- the straps are too far out on the shoulders and won't stay in place, so I will remove those.  The rouched upper half is too short and should be at least 2 inches more fabric from top to bottom.  The gathered bottom part barely covers the navel. Pulling it down or loosening the straps would totally uncover the bust.  If they hadn't skimped on the fabric, this would be a great little top."
2.0,"For a bit larger , bigger in the chest for my daughter , color nice , material ok"
2.0,"Nice looking watch, but it was not waterproof as shown in the picture. Don't let it get wet."
2.0,They were too small for my finger. Only one of them could really fit.
2.0,kind of short for my piercing. wore one for 1 month and it’s tarnishing. not great.
2.0,Fit great until they were washed. Now too short!
2.0,Shipped without strap. Basically useless
2.0,It's not really turquoise - more like mint green
2.0,"I got a size bigger than I usually am and this was still small. It's super uncomfortable and tighter than I expected.<br />The back side looks good but it's just too small and not comfortable.<br />Also, the fold-over isn't really there...it's still tight around the waist"
2.0,Came with imperfections in the silacone that created a hole.
2.0,Ordered an XL just to be sure and this XL fits more like a MEDIUM. And seems really cheap made. Super disappointed in this purchase.
2.0,"well what can i say, you get what you paid for.  it was cheap in price and looks it too."
2.0,"I bought this item due to it being made in USA but it was actually made in Vietnam.<br />For the price I paid I wish it had been manufactured in the States as the company claims hence the two star rating, other than that it serves it's purpose."
2.0,"The product  did not meet my expectations.  I wanted it as a choker,but it will not stay around the neck. I hope I can find a way to make it stay as a choker instead of a long necklace."
2.0,It is super cute but it is a true wrap and is extremely short so I wasn’t able to wear it. Perhaps if it wasn’t a true wrap the length wouldn’t be as much of an issue but I just felt super exposed!
2.0,"This is not a balaclava, packaging says it is a winter liner,  I would describe this more accurately as a hood, it does not cover the face if worn properly.  The size as it fits goes from the eyebrows to under the chin.  The product is not what they make out to be, very deceptive at the least"
2.0,"I received the dress yesterday, ordered a XL, i am disappointed, it looks cheaply made, definitely not what I was expecting also it is rose gold not gold"
2.0,"The sticker itself is great. That is why we chose it. However, it was folded in half to ship and bent. The 2 letters on the fold did not stick. Disappointed."
2.0,"Love the quality of the cashmere but the fit is all wrong. The sleeves and shirt tail are not long enough for tall women. This brand refuses to offer tall sizing. So while I love how their items look, I will never make a purchase again. I do not understand why the fashion industry has decided that tall women do not deserve quality clothes."
2.0,"This is listed as a child’s men’s, but sizes are for children only! These are not for men’s sizes!! Very misleading description. Returning it to China costs WAYYY more than the pants themselves. But still cute... going to give them to my little cousin and order an extra large... fingers crossed!"
2.0,"When it 1st arrived it looked amazing. About 1 week later it's all very scratched up, you barley touch it and it gets fingerprints on it. To top that off, the very end says 'we will fight theN together' instead of saying fight theM 😤😤"
2.0,"These gloves do not say leather anywhere, they say pu.  They don’t smell like leather & don’t fit like."
2.0,This is a cheap knock off. It doesnt look like denim and it is very flimsyband cheap looking
2.0,"cheap material, feels like your oldest most used towel"
2.0,"So, in terms of fabric quality - great quality and good material. Looks exactly as pictured. Overall look -- stylish and fashionably cute!!! However, wearing it is absolutely awful - it literally requires gymnast flexibility in order to snap the closure.  Whether this is a ""one time instance"" design flaw on my particular suit, or if it is the design overall, I do not know. Bodysuits generally snap via two fabric ""flaps"" that meet in the middle and connect with snaps. These are the uncomfortable plastic snaps. Though, that is not my complaint. I can handle that. What I can't stand about this suit is that the back ""flap"" of fabric is set so far back, that you're literally doing gymnastics to get it snapped. Think reaching your arms as far back as you can go toward your derriere in order to connect. I wore it one time and unless I take the time to have it altered, I'd never wear it again. The reason being, I don't have the time it requires to host a gymnast routine each time I need to use the restroom while out on a dinner date. By the end of the evening I had just tucked it in, which leant to a bit of an unpleasant bulky look. If the issue above were fixed it would be perfect!!"
2.0,The quality feels flimsy and could possibly crack under hours of pressure while gaming. One analog thumbstick came deformed and dented. Not exactly the same quality and comfort as the original PS4 thumbsticks.
2.0,I'm suspicious why there are so many good reviews and not a single one mentions that the color bleeds! My daughter is going to love these pajamas but the color bleeds. Good thing I soaked them first to see if the dye will run. Washing these separately from all of our other laundry isn't going to be ideal.
2.0,"It’s cute for sure and seems well made but doesn’t match the photo. I ordered the ""Light Pink"" and it looks just like the picture of ""Pink"" version. I contacted the seller (ISTORAGE) and sent them a photo of what I received and they said it was indeed the ""Light Pink"" one that I received. Judging by photos other people have posted of the real light pink version, I clearly received the wrong color. I will upload photos to this review once that function is available. (Currently, due to Covid-19 staff shortages, video or photo upload functions are disabled on reviews). I imagine the dark pink one is much darker than the photo they presented on the description. Also, not that it matters much, but the stars on the skirt are hot pink in my version, rather than silver. If you really need to have that color right, I would just choose black instead, to be safe. The dress I ordered in no way matches the shoes I bought for her now. I'm hoping the seller makes it right with me, or at least updates the product images and availability if the true ""Light Pink"" one isn't available anymore so no one else has to deal with this unfortunate mistake."
2.0,"My ears are not particularly sensitive, but these inflamed my ear holes and are quite heavy."
2.0,"Loved the bag, lots of organization, but about two weeks in the stitching started coming out.  Among other places the end of the zipper came loose and I was unable to get it back on track,  So now I am going to have to buy a new purse, because it is useless without the main zipper. .Since the other stitching is failing, fixing the zipper would not have helped anyway. If only they had used a smaller stitch and a better thread."
2.0,"Nice kimono but it smells so bad! Smells of some kind of chemical, I won't even try to wash it, the smell is so strong I don't think I can get it out.  I will return"
2.0,I loved the cut & length of this skirt. It runs small in the waist & is paper-thin. Returned
2.0,Like the style & material of dress...  but these are not true to size...  runs smaller than it should.....
2.0,"I was very disappointed with the color of the dial. Instead of the beautiful, photoshopped blue you get in the images, the dial is a dark, dull color. And the strap, looking metallic in the pics, is actually dyed black. Very disappointing look."
2.0,This is too short to have cost this much.
2.0,"It is not true to size. In fact, a lot smaller. The material very thin. Not satisfied."
2.0,"It's cute, but poorly made.  There is either an extra button hole in the front or they sent me one that was missing a button."
2.0,The material was very cheap and itchy almost and it fit small I definitely returned this.
2.0,I love the glasses but they arrived with the lens scratched and the arms loose.
2.0,These do stretch but they are already way to big for my head
2.0,"I ordered an XL. I am between a L and XL on most clothes, and I’ve never gotten an Xl that is too small. I expect camis to be stretchy but these are NOT. They have absolutely 0 stretch, and run small. The top fit beautifully but otherwise they are so tight they are uncomfortable to wear. I also don’t consider myself to have a short torso but I have a hard time even wearing these with pants. They go all the way past my butt."
2.0,"Sending it back. Sad day. I LOVE the color. So hard to find. I am 5'4&#34;, 34B, 130 lbs with a large booty. I ordered a small (normally size 4-6) and this was HUGE. Arm holes way low, and just huge. The material was odd as well. Was so hoping this would fit. Not for me."
2.0,What kind of mess is this? Always a medium and these pants fit like an XL...
2.0,"Im 130 pounds I orde M and somehow is to big like the tap part and kind the tide on your belly,decent material but not true color I order dusty green and looks like light green definitely not the green I was looking for,I still wear it but maybe around the house not to go out."
2.0,"The pants were much larger than the size I ordered and the cut/fit is terrible. They feel like you have your pants on backwards. Two stars because even though the zipper is also cheap, the fabric and stitching is decent and these might work for someone whose butt is on the wrong side."
2.0,"Very cute and pretty dress, but after the 1st wash I found a hole.... I wish for the price I paid it was better quality."
2.0,These are too bulky and heavy to actually wear and function in.
2.0,It's cute but only for little girls &#34;Only for age of 4 to 7 years&#34;. I don't recommend this for adults unless it's Halloween and you want to match it with your outfit. It's really really small. Don't get fooled by the picture.
2.0,They ride up.  Thought it would be more like spandex.
2.0,Not a fan of the fit. Was very tight along sides.
2.0,"It isa gorgeous scarf, however the one I received has a very large imperfection right in the center of it. Will be sending back. Very disappointing."
2.0,They are sparkle printed and not actually sparkly at all. There is zero glitter. Super misleading
2.0,"Weird shape to these.  It's like I received three 2 packs of three different sizes.  Nice fabric, quality construction, but don't fit at all.  They have no leg when on, they just stretch straight across and don't cover the rear at all.  Too bad because they would be great if they actually had a little leg to them so they're not riding up halfway on the backside.  2 of them were really small, 2 of them were really huge and 2 of them were in between.  Crazy."
2.0,Does not lift
2.0,"Doesn’t look like the picture, it is cheaply stitched especially in the butt ruched area.  I liked it my husband did not. Not a high quality product, Indont expect it to last more than a couple of times wearing it and in the wash."
2.0,"these tanks are see through and of poor quality.  They are not long, and they are not compression anything.  not able to wear as a tank alone, but only as an undershirt"
2.0,"The color was nice, but it is a cheaply made. It is waaaaay to short and waaaaay too tight. I ordered a size up so it would be appropriate for church paired with a blazer and NOPE! I am not pleased at all"
2.0,I just got my sons shoes in and one of the shoes won't charge. Not sure what to do don't have a number to even call... Please help
2.0,"These gloves are nice and warm but be warned, if you child doesn't take them off carefully the inner part of the glove pulls out of place. Have fun getting the fingers lined back up with the outer layer. Honestly, I wish I hadn't purchased them."
2.0,"I bought a medium, fits more like a large.  Really thin material.,"
2.0,"I've ordered three by this point:<br /><br />-The paint was seriously peeling off the first one.<br /><br />-The second one also had a minor paint issue (just peeling on a tiny spot). I scheduled a return for it because the clasp was broken in the strap (which ment the purse kept auto detaching when jostled).<br /><br />-The third one does not have an adjustable strap like the first two did. It's the only one that's not damaged in some obvious way, and it's missing a key feature.<br /><br />-Notes on the pictures: One picture shows the raised paint, one has the broken clasp/strap, and one has the two straps to compare the adjustable version and the cheap non-adjustable version.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm probably going to keep the final one, but I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Read the reviews and adjusted my daughter's size accordingly (runs large). Still too big AND my child said they were not comfortable.  She's used to wearing New Balance with plenty of cushion and support.  Sent these back...sticking with New Balance.
2.0,"With the exception of the skeleton mask with the butterflies and rainbow, all of the other prints were vibrant in color and as expected. My daughter really wanted these because of the skeleton one and it wasn't as pictured on the site, so she was disappointed. I do like that these are lightweight and seem easy to breathe in. I purchased them for my 10 year old to wear to school. I did expect that they might be slightly big because I thought that they were more for adults. However, these are extremely LARGE in size. Like, huge. They don't stay on her face at all. I tried one on too and it doesn't fit me either. It is so large that it slides off my nose and falls under my chin. Basically, these are useless for us because we wanted them for masks. Super disappointed because I liked the lightweight fabric and the fact that that seem easy to breathe in. They are also probably comfortable to wear for a long period of time because they are silky and soft. I'm not even sure what I want to do with them at this point. I could return them, but I might take them in and make them smaller to fit better. It's annoying that I have to tailor them to work the way they we're intended."
2.0,Serves the purpose for a workout top but I constantly feel like I’m being choked by the neck
2.0,These probably do a great job - on someone who doesnt need more protection from sunlight.  Black does me better.  They look nice!  Wish I could wear them but my eyes need darker..
2.0,The hat was too small. Hat barely stays on. Pediatrician says my baby has an below average-average sized head so I expected the hat to fit or be big.
2.0,"Very thin , and poorly made ! not up to the standards I expected from real tree very disappointed!"
2.0,I think the style is very cool it is a little heavy.I need a watch for my job and I move around a lot. But If you move around to much the watch stops and you loose time. It is my first day having it and i had to correct it 3 times. I like the concept but its not for my line of work.
2.0,"These look super cheap, like something you’d get out of a quarter machine. The colors are exactly as pictured, but they seriously look like a kid’s toy on your finger."
2.0,The band will not click into place. Same as the other Moretek band I tried.
2.0,They sent a size 7 pant with a size 4 top for one of the sets. Purchased this for my son’s trip to Toronto and now it is not usable. Very disappointed .
2.0,These ran small and quality was poor.
2.0,I prefer to not comprise quality for length. It does indeed hit the floor on my tall frame (33” inseam) but the quality of the fabric and sewing technique is not up to par. The pockets stick out creating a weird shape in the hips and the straps are not adjustable as previewed in the picture. Unfortunately I will be returning this.
2.0,I EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY LENSES AND I SUPPOSE AFTER USING MAUI JIMS FOR SO MANY YEARS I HAD BEEN SPOILED. I WON'T BUY FROM YOU AGAIN.
2.0,"Could basically be a dress it is so huge (and I am a US size 16). That wouldn't have bothered me, but it was cut pretty unflattering and the material was a little itchy."
2.0,"I like the way the mask looked unfortunely I couldnt really see, the eyes were really far apart, it was hard to breath in as well. I tried a replacement mask and it was the same. In the end I decided just to make a mask out of foam."
2.0,Decent quality.  But not worth the three month shipping from China.
2.0,Doesn't glow in the dark at all.
2.0,"The chains constantly broke, which meant very sad kids."
2.0,"I read reviews before deciding to go with the xl. (I am normally a large so I sized up one) I should have ordered an xxl or larger if they have it! It is too short in the torso and arms. (I am 5' 10"") With one wash it will be a belly shirt. The quilted part also hits me in the chest in a weird spot and not very flattering. I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing this! :(<br />It is really soft though and a beautiful color!"
2.0,Nice shoes but not durable! 3 months and ripped
2.0,It wasn’t the shirt that’s advertised fits like a regular shirt and doesn’t hang off a shoulder
2.0,After just two times in the washer the pants already had holes and fell apart. If it wouldn't be for the poor quality I would rate much higher. The fit was perfect
2.0,Shows every bump.
2.0,They got too hot. I know that sounds weird but the heating elements seemed to overheat so I had to unplug them
2.0,This shirt looks great on amazon but the material had a texture that felt like a towel or a scour pad. It was awful and I will NOT be wearing it.
2.0,It is a very cute piece. However in about a week one of the chains rusted and broke. This was without getting it wet to. Never entered any water with it on with the worry that would happen. Would recommend for a causal wear not an everyday bellyring
2.0,cheap chain. replaced pieces with a new one. chains break even if you fix. good fades. fast. I ended up spray painting them & coating with spray paint enamel & clear finger nail polish (can't find pieces anywhere else) it's way nicer now. don't recommend unless you want extra work lol smh. hope this helps 💋
2.0,"I ordered this for a gift and was disappointed in the quality of the fabric. It was VERY thin for the price. It seemed like a much cheaper gift than how much I paid (and what I was hoping to give). The neck is not adjustable so I hope it even fits. Otherwise, the print looked good and it is a cute idea for a Game of Thrones fan. I paid $35 and it seems there are many other similar options out there for less and for sure aprons for that price that are better quality.<br /><br />It arrived on time though/packaging was fine."
2.0,"A lot of loose threads and thin material. Not very soft, has a plastic feel to the fabric. The fit is as expected but the item is not worth the price."
2.0,Very short and tight!
2.0,"Very, very poor quality for costume jewelry. I was planning to give this as a small gift but am returning it instead. Don't waste your money."
2.0,"Airtag falls out.  I can't even say ""pops"" out, because it's not held in that securely.  I expected more."
2.0,They go way past the knee and very tight. If u have calves not recommended. I had hard time getting on n so tight if small legs they would work great!!
2.0,Didn't really fit right...a little uncomfortable since they keep falling off my feet
2.0,Looks good from the front but not flattering from behind. The cut in the back is the same as the front. Imagine what that looks like on fuller bottoms.
2.0,"very cute, but the sleeves hurt! They are very itchy."
2.0,When i removed the garment i noticed the stitching is coming undone around the bottom and breast area.
2.0,"This measuring device didn't work for me and my wide feet. It does measure length pretty good, but that's not what I was looking for."
2.0,I was expecting the black glasses to be exact shape and size as the others and they were not. Will be returning to exchange for the right ones I expected to receive.
2.0,Doesn't last long already 2 broke in half as I tried to screw in.
2.0,Nice but small and very thin. No protection.
2.0,"I ordered these earrings in multi color. After unboxing, the actual tassel colors were MUCH more neon/ fluorescent than the lighter/ pastel colors shown in the product’s picture. They’re a cute piece but after only one day of wear (about 6-7 hours), the hoop part of the earring turned green and tarnished. My ear was not green from the loop at all, but the gold finish has already began to wore off and does not compliment the tassels or earring itself. Probably will not wear them another time since they have already turned."
2.0,"This necklace is great for Egyptian dress up, but it arrived broken into two parts! :-("
2.0,Cheap. I work at a school and bought this to hold my face Mack around my neck. Clasp broke after two days. Want to the craft store and got some new once. Hope the rest holds up.
2.0,Fabric is very thin and shows every figure flaw.
2.0,I did not care for the quality of the fabric or the design. The big brown buttons were spaced too far apart.
2.0,I returned this because it was way too big and didn't look very much like the photo.
2.0,"I'm happy enough with the tips of the gloves working on my phone--like a charm, even--and they're plenty warm, but one of the gloves arrived with a big ol' hole between two of the fingers, and I'm worried some of the other stitches starting to unravel too.<br /><br />Or maybe it'll be perfect for years aside from that one hole. Who knows? Either way, I kinda regret buying online where I couldn't check for that kind of defect and return shipping would cost as much as a new pair."
2.0,I loved how they fit but the threading only lasted about a month so don't buy
2.0,"The skeleton design is cute,  but not impressed otherwise. Marketed as a sweatshirt,  it's too thin to be a sweatshirt. The fit is weird on me, a little short so I'm afraid to wash it (I do have a long torso though) and the arms are big with too much gathering at the wrist seam. Looked way cuter online. Will use this for pj's."
2.0,"I should know better than to assume it would look like it does on the model, but still, the structure and the actual build of the skirt is not as pictured. It  is not flattering for (my) body type at least. For reference: I'm 5'3, 130pounds, and the skirt enlarged my waist rather than give a smaller illusion (which is how most of these skirts work with my body, thus the purchase)."
2.0,They don't fit well
2.0,"I got toddler size, for my not even 18 months old, and they did shrink a lot after two washes, and I didn’t put them in the dryer* too small now:( (!!!)"
2.0,All of them broke on me but one.
2.0,"My granddaughter is 4 1/2 years, she wears size 8 shoe. So I selected the size 4-6 Ankle Socks that will fit to shoe size 7-10.<br />The socks are somehow smaller than her feet.<br />Is it a misleading advertise?"
2.0,"If yellowed the watch is close to decomposing and the parts that look like plastic are not plastic and even a brand new one from the 1990s will desolve or break up- with sweat, water, and any chemical; such as Energine"
2.0,It's so small! Looks like a child's watch. Was very sad to see when it arrived. Love the color and design but looks silly.
2.0,"OK, it is not very practical.  It does have metal spokes but they are no problem.  The 'non-stretch' headband is quite large.  The tie straps are not comfortable and a bit short.  I wish I had tried the curved top instead.  I may try to rework this thing because as it is, it is unusable."
2.0,"Really narrow fit, had to exchange then for the Corbina's. But besides the fit, the green lens 580G are the best on the market."
2.0,It’s not easy anything
2.0,"Paid for it, came smaller than expected. Lasted a couple of days and came apart. Anniversary gift suckable....."
2.0,I really hate misleading advertisements. The title says leather. Later in the ad it has different ways of describing it but at first glance you would assume this is a leather bag. It isn't. It is polyurethane. The label is deep inside the bag.<br /><br />It's a nice enough purse but not very big. It doesn't open up very wide on the top. Pretty enough but nothing fantastic.
2.0,They were not what I was expecting but they will do in a pinch.
2.0,Didn’t cover well on the side without strap
2.0,ran very small.  But the company was kind enough to refund part of the price. and I kept the shirt and I'm cutting it up and making a new one.
2.0,They're just not made well. The fit is just wrong doesn't hit in the right spots uncomfortable for a man to wear.
2.0,"The print is nicer on the screen, an the fabric is really flimsy. Sent it back."
2.0,"Looks like dollar store quality, cheaply made"
2.0,Not sure why I even gave 2 stars. The giraffe drawing is nowhere near as cute as advertised and they are huge. I am a woman's 9.5 and there is so much room left.  I guess if I had to say one good thing is that they are soft.
2.0,"It is cute, but the fit is cut for an asian frame. Not for American sizes. Gave to my 13 yr old and fits her fine. Would not order for an American adult."
2.0,These shorts are extremely thin material and much smaller than a true 10/12.
2.0,T-shirt is average material and cute design. Shorts are really bad quality. They feel like cardboard I swear...cute from a distance
2.0,"The belt fits fine and it's high quality but the buckle is a much darker color than the one in the picture.  I thought it was a sliver (chrome) color,<br />like the one in the picture  but the one I received was a very dark Grey color."
2.0,Flimsy fabric and loose threads.  Like the style and color.
2.0,Very thin and poor quality! Was not worth the money
2.0,Way to small. Tried Medium and Large. Both fit the same.
2.0,Product is CHEAP.  Honestly looks like it came from a 25cent machine.  I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Sent them back immediately after opening them. The masks were full adult size masks. Would not have fit the face of my 7 year old.
2.0,Really pretty! More silver looking which is what I wanted. But it broke after only 2 months and I couldn't fix it.
2.0,Bought this item recently and it has broken already. I would love for the company to replace it because I love this necklace so much.
2.0,I think the print should be on both sides.  It’s white on the inside.
2.0,Itchy. Neckline was lower than pictured. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,Hard to breathe and see.
2.0,"The arm holes were huge, they almost went down to my belly button! Not a very flattering cut either."
2.0,too small.... decent quality fabric but the sizing was really off at least 2 sizes
2.0,Advertised as 2 pcs. Expecting 2 pins due to this & pix showing collar w/ 2 pins. Backing is required for usage & should not be counted as an extra piece!!!!! Feedback for seller not indicated. Amazon corrected order.Pin itself is lovely. It is basically a tie tac.
2.0,Cute but I must have the smallest ears in the world! They are so big the jacket doesn't sit anywhere near my ear lobe. Disappointed in this purchase form chuvora. This is the first thing I didn't like from them.
2.0,"This shirt shrunk after I washed it and it was already difficult to wear, now it is just impossible to wear and gets tossed to the back of the closet like everything else. I do believe this shirt was a little small on my arms and shorter than I like along my torso, and there will be no repeat buys from me."
2.0,"I ordered a size up and it fit fine. Came with a hooe in the hem around the arm, no problem, I sticked it up myself but then on the first day a button fell off. Think ill just use it as a bathing suit cover up at this point. I dont reccomend purchasing."
2.0,It would be cute on a petite individual. I just is not big enough for a 5'10 XL Gal.
2.0,"No, looks a bit lighter in person and it was too little for me. Other than that I liked it but returned it."
2.0,Pockets are placed weird and make my waist look bigger than I am.
2.0,"So cute but ""suggested "" size 9, one size too big. Some ""fur"" came off,  first wear. Going to return and hopefully will do better with size 8. If not, will ask for refund."
2.0,Cheap quality. Seams are opening first wear. Cups are is not as defined as the photos but fit my F cup with spillage like a corset usually would. Way small. I’ll have to sew in material on the modesty panel. I should’ve sized up 2 or 3 sizes above the recommendation just to have the modesty panel cover correctly. The front claps are dangerous af. The sharp metal cut a chunk out of my thumb trying to close it. The back ribbon was so stretched in order to loosen the fit that it made it harder to tie than it should’ve been. The panties are of course a joke and not meant to fit a human.  1 Star for the fact that I bled and am missing a chunk of skin as a result of this product. Not happy.
2.0,The whole shoe is very stiff and fits too large.
2.0,The fit is small which was expected so I ordered a couple sizes up and that worked. The material was pretty transparent. Make sure you have an undershirt.
2.0,"Cute pants, but one size definitely does not fit all. Take great care in washing them. Hand wash only and hang to dry. They are very fragile. If you have thighs that rub, they will start to fray the inside seams after a bit. :("
2.0,The casing across the back sits so low that when you tighten the ties the fabric puffs and bulges weirdly. If your goal is to look like you have a major spinal deformity then this dress is just the thing.<br />I ripped the casing out and reattached the ties up where my waist actually sits and now it's acceptable to wear without looking odd.
2.0,Really cool glasses but I would pay more just to ensure the battery compartment can't open up as easily as it does. Button batteries are so dangerous so that really killed it for me...otherwise I would love them
2.0,"disappointed that it’s not as heavy as the other stones I’d previously purchased from Ayana Wellness. Feels kind of cheap. The stone is also rather dull looking, compared to my other purchases. It’s just an okay purchase."
2.0,The size 9 ring I ordered is the size of a dime it doesn’t fit very unhappy
2.0,"It’s cute, that is all I can say good about it.<br />It isn’t all silver, it is tarnished after 1 week.<br />When I first got it it had a sharp piece sticking out from where the stones are.<br />Disappointed cuz it is basically trash now"
2.0,"The shirt I received was NOT gray, it was blue, which isn’t even an option that’s available.  Quality seems ok, but I’d be much happier if it was the color I ordered"
2.0,Dramatic difference between size of flip flop and size of canvas shoes even though they suppose to be same size.
2.0,The polarization is awesome on these they are great lenses. However they dont fit as snug as they should in the frames. They are just a little small but as long as you don't touch the lenses they stay in pretty well.
2.0,The letters on this are maybe 1” tall! The picture in the description makes it look like they are larger letters.
2.0,"I loved this top in theory, however the lining/undershirt portion was too tight to be comfortable. I had to return."
2.0,"Bracelet is small... beads are small and the length is short. Guess, should have paid more attention to the description."
2.0,"Not the loose, comfy cover up I was hoping for at all."
2.0,These pants are see through. Well made. But see through.
2.0,Poor quality stitching. Needed to repair.
2.0,Eh. Not as pretty as the picture. Seems very cheap I ordered beige but got white. For the price I guess it will do but you definitely get what you pay for with this product.
2.0,"I purchased this item because my daughter was allergic to the original band with her apple watch. Turns out she was allergic to this one too. She has a large wrist, the band came undone twice and it fell off her wrist. It's very pretty and easy to install."
2.0,"As you can see from this picture, these dig into your face.  I gave 2 stars because they are, in fact, anti-fog and the strap is easy to adjust.  I can swim laps for 30 minutes without them fogging.  However, they are as painful to wear as generic, cheap goggles.  They also come with different bridge widths, but all widths make the goggles dig into your face."
2.0,"Looks good, but broke in 2-3 months.  The metal is to soft and links broke creating hooks that snagged on clothing."
2.0,They were sturdy but looked cheap
2.0,sticky bottoms started coming off before I even washed any of them.
2.0,Stiff plastic. Get a real leather strap.
2.0,NOT KNIT !!! They're nylon and not knit. So not what I wanted ... At all.
2.0,This looks like it wasn't finished or something.  Seams look unfinished and sloppy.
2.0,There ok . Not a fan of the material and they are very high waisted .
2.0,"Cheap, very cheap looking."
2.0,"Leg is too thin, always stuck in the leg belly"
2.0,Did not look good on.
2.0,"I was a little disappoint of this product, when I got it in the mail and opened it. The wallet is really cheaply made and the chain was as well and it just didn't look like bright colors like in the photo. And the button thing that goes on you're loop of you're pants, looks nothing like it in the photo."
2.0,Non zip pockets expensive I will keep looking
2.0,"I bought this bag from a very well known department store. Within the first 3 weeks things started breaking on it. This is with normal use, nothing rough, and with using the bag every two to four days or so. I returned it to the store and they allowed me to replace it with the exact same product since I had no receipt. This replacement bag began falling apart within the first 3 weeks or so as well.  This included:<br /><br />-Zipper pull tab fell off (both bags).<br /><br />-Stitching on the side pocket's velcro closure came undone to the point where the velcro patch was only held on by a few stitches on one corner.<br /><br />-Both loop handles began tearing off at stitching (both bags). Eventually one handle completely tore off of the 2nd bag.<br /><br />-Stitching at one corner of the first bag started coming undone.<br /><br />-Where shoulder strap meets the bag began tearing (both bags).<br /><br />As well as being a very poorly made bag, this bag is also impractical in a couple ways.<br /><br />-The side pocket is slim and is possibly made for only a thin notebook or a folder. There is no sensible place to put a laptop's power cord or other accessories, even just a small wireless mouse. (I shove my power cord and inverter in this pocket anyway, but it ends up making the bag look funny with a big bulge in the side of this otherwise sleek case.)<br /><br />-The clips of the shoulder strap get twisted any time there's not tension on the strap (in other words, any time the bag is picked up by the strap it is twisted.)<br />If the strap isn't untwisted before carrying it, the bag swings strangely at my side and the strap usually comes unclipped causing the computer to fall.<br /><br />The only thing right about this bag is that it is cute.<br /><br />Useless, but cute."
2.0,Paint chipped off of this belt within 2 months
2.0,Material is VERY thin. I had to wear a tank top and biker shorts underneath.
2.0,"I wasn't expecting an heirloom piece by any means but this is pretty cruddy looking.  The flower is bright and pretty shiny.  I'll wear it but it won't be a favorite piece.  I may pop the flower off, paint it, and hot glue it back on."
2.0,The laces come undone. Not worth the money.
2.0,"I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I was very disappointed in the quality. In the picture the ruffle is very full and looks like a darker shade of pink, when I received this the ruffles are very thin and small and do not show up against the fabric. The bow is cheaply made and not securely attached. The work &#34;princess&#34; is hardly legible. I would not recommend this outfit at all."
2.0,"I love Hell Bunny and have several of their clothing items and was hopefull for this one to be good quality.<br /><br />The shirt is thin and looks like polyester.<br /><br />It also doesn't fit right.<br /><br />Too wide in the waist and too big in the chest area.<br /><br />If you are full figured and aren't thin, then it would probably work well for your figure."
2.0,Some pieces turn/don’t maintain their color. I’ve only worn a few items for a few days and they are now brown
2.0,"Not true to size, size up once or maybe even twice"
2.0,Although it's true to it sizing the material lays way to close & fit to the body and makes you look like you're unable to breathe(not the literally). The material is soft and NOT see-through so that's a plus but too long it has a nice fit and enhanced all the cruve your body has lol. The color is very pretty and true from their color  selection.
2.0,Wreath looks like it should go for windows not the front door
2.0,Cute but broke the second day
2.0,"Perfect size and excellent quality.  The actual color is not as pictured; instead of a rich light blue, the shade is more of a dull metal blue.  I will be returning because of the color."
2.0,Comfortable material. But the stitches are coming off already. It is only 2-3 months
2.0,"Honestly, I couldn’t believe these when I got them. I had read other reviews that stated it was a small key ring. But, I ordered anyway. Well, shame on me! As you can see from the photo, it’s about the size of a quarter. As such, it will not hold many keys at once, especially if you hope to use it for car keys or those with caps. Fiddling with it, I can also tell it may not last long. But, that will remain to be seen. Not worth $9. Only worth $1, $2 tops for two of these tiny things!"
2.0,"Took 2 months for arrival. Ordered beginning on November, just arrived today, January 4th. Product is good, simple. Shipping is an issue."
2.0,Really doesn't clean well
2.0,Ordered a 2X. He’s 6 foot and it’s too short.
2.0,These are the size of my 6 year old Granddaughter.  Sizing is way off!
2.0,They run big. The and1 label came off the first day of wearing. The are a one piece shoe made to last just not label. The good part they float in water. Lol
2.0,"Fits small,  accurate color. A bit pricey for this product in my opinion."
2.0,"The rose gold has all chipped away and is turning my finger green. The stone is beautiful but the metal is cheap, sadly."
2.0,"I have tried just about every kind of alarm clock I could find and have always had serious issues waking up.  I have slept through fire alarms, slept through an alarm that has a vibrating attachment inside my pillow case, slept through alarms that probably have woken up my neighbors, nothing ever consistently worked for me.  I was very hesitant to spend $150 on another gadget in the hopes that it would actually work for me but I finally gave in and purchased this in May.<br /><br />The good:<br />-The shock function of this thing is great.  I don't think I've slept through a shock since I have had this.<br />-Jumping Jack and QR Code functions are definitely great ideas and work well...sometimes.<br />-The band and device are comfortable and do not feel as bulky or cheap as some other reviewers have mentioned.  They could both definitely be improved upon but overall they are not bad.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-The connectivity between this and my phone is incredibly spotty.  Sometimes it connects right away and stays connected, sometimes it takes an act of Congress to get it to connect and keep it connected.  None of my other bluetooth devices have this issue so I know it isn't a problem with my phone.<br />-Jumping Jack and QR Code functions both have incredibly frustrating problems.  The jumping jack function lets you set the number of jumping jacks you have to do before it stops shocking you but this thing apparently hasn't ever attended a math class in its life.  Regardless of how many jumping jacks I set it for it can either take 3-4 to shut it off or 30-40.  Very rarely will it shut off at the correct number of jumping jacks.<br /><br />The QR code issue works well but due to the connectivity issues I mentioned earlier it takes entirely too long to get the alarm to stop shocking you.  It disconnects from the app before the alarm goes off, yet is somehow still connected enough to show you on the app that you need to scan the code to turn the alarm off.  During the time it is shocking you it won't allow you to connect and then when it stops and lets you try connecting it takes so long that the alarm starts shocking you again.  This loop cycles 5-6 times before you can get it to connect and actually scan the code.  On the bright side, I'm always wide awake by the time I can finally get it turned off.<br /><br />-Finally(and most importantly), the shock function has started to only work when it wants to.  Sometimes it works flawlessly, sometimes it does absolutely nothing.  I have no idea what is causing the issue but it's very frustrating to have spent $150 on an alarm that only functions sometimes.  I didn't buy this because I want to wake up on time every now and then.  I bought this because I want to wake up on time every time.  If this was several years old or had been damaged in any way it would be understandable for it to be unreliable.  It's only a few months old and has spent its entire life either on my wrist in bed or on my nightstand.<br /><br />I looked on Pavlok's website to check the warranty and they have a note that Amazon customers have to send their product back to them before a replacement will be issued.  So now I have to decide if it's worth the risk of keeping it and hoping it decides to work correctly or to send it back and not have it at all for an unknown amount of time while they decide if they want to honor the warranty.  Neither are really good options and nothing about this feels like it has been worth $150."
2.0,"The color shown was purple.  The shirt that came is more of a periwinkle. The picture just doesn’t show up very well on that color, especially the light blue lines."
2.0,Cute design but too long and loose where it is held up.  There is no elastic so the only thing that holds them up is a tie and will periodically loosen throughout wear making it necessary to constantly readjust.
2.0,"It is definitely a nice necklace but it constantly gets twisted and tangled up, and pieces of it come out. They also rub on your neck witch becomes irritating after a while. Would not buy again."
2.0,"I find this sweater is very short, and runs small."
2.0,I bought 2 had to return them both. Color wasn't uniform across chest on the green one. The shoulder stitching on the blue one was puckered.
2.0,"I love the look of the bag, but i can honestly say that the bad smell is not going away...and i tried a lot! I own this bag now over a year and its still smells bad. Would not buy it again."
2.0,The idea is cute an i like them it was just too hard to roll back up would live this if it was a little easier to use
2.0,Material much thinner than expected
2.0,"Super cute party hats.  Very dissapointed to find they had to be assembled, including attaching the strings.  The product details do not say assembly required, that should be added."
2.0,"these sports bras don't give much support. if you are going to use it as an active wear, you would need to wear a sports bra inside. kind of defeats the whole purpose of buying it in the first place"
2.0,As I said about the wallet  was way to big and bold for me. Sent back and got something more my taste.
2.0,they run way to wide
2.0,After less than a month the leather was peeling off of the plastic at the corners and edges. Loved it at first but quickly became very disappointed.
2.0,"Although this set of earrings is supposed to be for sensitive ears,it was very foiggovilt yo get the earrings on and off"
2.0,"The color was not the same as in the picture and the eyes are huge, looked so hoaky, but for the price what could I expect!"
2.0,They are very cute but the opening on the diaper area makes no sense.
2.0,The dress may be beautiful but the sizing is completely off! I ordered one size up from my normal size and it still doesn't fit. You definitely need to order 2 sizes up to be on the safe side.
2.0,"These glasses look good and very stylish in the photos, they don't fit and are uncomfortable.  The nose pieces are molded and cannot be adjusted and they sit too low and down on my cheek.<br />Would like to return."
2.0,I am quite disappointed in how long my refund has taken.
2.0,I'm not kidding this skirt is like American girl size or like toddler size. I pulled it out the bag and was like omg!!! R u serious???? I wouldn't suggest anyone to order from these people!
2.0,"It fits well, but I don’t like the material. It’s that super silky polyester they they always try to put prints on. I didn’t think the actual colors in the dress look as vibrant as in the picture. I’ll keep it for those occasions I need a dress in a pinch."
2.0,"I got this for my sister who is a medium. The medium was so incredibly tight on her, the shorts barely fit. I have to return it & they’re charging me for postage to return it. Ridiculous."
2.0,The waist has minimal elastic grip so they slide down as time goes by... Have to keep pulling them up.
2.0,Very disappointed. Quality is not very good and it fell apart. I have to take it to a jeweler to tighten and reconnect the connections because they are very loose and do not hold the necklace together.
2.0,"The quality of this shirt is fairly subpar from what you'd want in a hoodie, but for the price, it makes sense. I ordered a size up and it still fit very tight (I am an intermeditiate builder, at best). I knew it would be a bit tight, but the V-neck combined with the tightness was extremely feminine. I will never wear this. I gave it to my wife for pajama-wear."
2.0,"This hurts my face but I'm going to see if my boys want to use it, maybe it'll fit them better."
2.0,"Cute, but way way too small. A 5t did not fit my youngest that wears a 4t both in the mid section or the arms. And same for the older boy who normally wears a 5t."
2.0,Wife says it is way too small. Well made wife says it is two cups too small and the band was supposed to be a 42 she said it's not even a 38.
2.0,Too big and came wayyy too late
2.0,had to go up 2 sizes
2.0,"This &#34;one size&#34; apron is sized for a child, maybe a teenager but not an adult....unless you want to put your hands into pockets on your chest. Even extending the strap all the way open it does not fit a large adult."
2.0,"Nice watch. But it went crazy displaying the numbers in a weird motion. Did take it to a jewelry and the guy told my the chip on i ws faulty.<br />Even tho it went displaying the numbers really fast, the battery seems it did not care about as it is still running.<br />😃"
2.0,Love these dolls but they fall apart way to easy.. You have to super glue them
2.0,Hurts my hand trying to use
2.0,"I like the deal, but these are not durable whatsoever. Within the first day, I was already seeing wear around the elastic band. Within a week, the elasticity of the entire cap was worn out. You get what you pay for I guess. *shrugs*"
2.0,"I wear a 13 shoe, ordered the 13-14 size and they are at least a size small.  When I put my foot in, it is a struggle to pull the back over my heal, and fits far to snug for a slipper.  If you wear a 14, definitely order the 15-16 size."
2.0,"I wanted to love these shorts, but I hated the hi-low cut on the legs and the legs seemed oddly wide. returned them"
2.0,No mention of a nylon string in the description. Never had a buff like this. Horrible.  The Nylon string could be hidden if turned upside down but then the flag and US Navy emblems are upside down.
2.0,The shoe runs a bit small and narrow. We ended up buying a different pair for school. The bow also came untied after 2 days we had to cut it off as we couldn’t re-tie it.
2.0,Smaller than expected.  The fit is too tight.
2.0,tighter than I would have hoped for an XL size.
2.0,"It's see through and it's way too small. I usually wear a small and I got a medium because I wanted it to be fitted, but not skin tight. Well it's skin tight. Even if it wasn't, I'd have to wear bottoms as it only goes to the bottom of my butt. So it's just a really long shirt that's more like an x-small rather than a medium. I wouldn't buy it again. If it wasn't only $5 I would return for my money back. I'm going to give it to my 10 year old daughter now."
2.0,"The bands were super nice and very stylish.  However, the watch is valued at $300+ and as soon as I put the band on, it ripped. It was very poorly put together and now I am skeptical about buying any bands due to this one incident.  You get what you pay for!!"
2.0,This wallet seemed flimsy compared to what I expected. I returned this.
2.0,The gloves does nothing for my arthritis fingers. They don't cover enough of my fingers. The only thing I can say good is that it's a comfortable fit.
2.0,Bought these to use at school. Received and 1 was broken. The other one wouldn’t stand up on head. Turkey laid down on head.
2.0,Its cute dont get me wrong but the top disappointed me &#34;busty&#34; woman can't wear it crossed infront<br />Have to wear like a normal top.<br />Quality seems ok. Give it a 2 star.
2.0,THE BRACELET STONE SETTING IS TOO BIG. LOOKS TO  FALSE.  THANK YOU
2.0,"Just a little disappointing at how quickly the PJs pilled up, even after I air dried them!  They were never in the dryer. Fit is nice and so is length. Just wish quality of material was more decent."
2.0,"I was truly excited when ordering this. It looks great on the outside. Great quality. Until you open it up. The liner on the inside doesn’t reflect the style nor the quality on the outside. Not at all. Had I seen the PU leather liner, and that it is literally stitched to every part of it, I would not have ordered this. Everything I buy is 100% real leather and the inside of this product is beyond disappointing. The pictures they post on Amazon covers the inside with products so buyers can’t see the poor quality. It’s baggy and doesn’t even fit. It really is such a contrast and disappointment.  I contacted the manufacturer, but to date no reply. So customer service and product a total disappointment. I’m still waiting Cuero."
2.0,Didn’t like how the front area was sagging
2.0,The color was not what is pictured.
2.0,"This is my second order from PajamaGram, we have sent both back.  I won't by this again, to much pressure."
2.0,Well they sent me the wrong size. I ordered small and got a extra large. The quality felt nice even though it was big.
2.0,I did not like the fit or the material of the dress.
2.0,"The picture is vey deceiving of the size, the earrings are very cute but too small for an adult unless they have a second piercing. Not sure if it is worth returning or just find a young girl to gift them to"
2.0,"I initially tried this on and it looked alright so I removed the tags and washed. After washing (according to the instructions on the label), it did not fit the same. There is a lot of extra material on the skirt and really accentuates my hips, too much. I am curvy, especially in the hip area. The top fits well, but it doesn't take long for it to stretch out and look loose.  I am 5'2"" and 127 pounds and ordered the Medium. It seems this is the right size. I wish I returned this before removing tags and washing."
2.0,what I received was not at all what was pictured. there was no tie at waist and it was a totally different fabric pattern<br />I don't hate it so I'm going to keep it but just wanted to let customers know you may not get exactly what you ordered
2.0,It is brighter that what I have expected.
2.0,Had to send back and took over a month for anything to be done. No refund no nothing and the shorts or unwearable the 42 fit more like a 32 or comfortable 36 US.<br />The shorts themselves are nice material
2.0,Arrived in 2 days but with a pearl off. Will now have to return the item.<br />Not sure if the poor quality control is due to the fact that this was a lightning deal purchase but very disappointed..<br />It's a pity coz the necklace itself is very pretty and wish I could have it replaced..at the same price of course!
2.0,Nice casual summer dress … but incorrectly sized. It was much much smaller. I am a size 8 and ordered a medium. An X-Large may have been a great fit.
2.0,"Im 5""1 and 115 lbs and purchased a M and it was soooo tight when i tried it on without a bra. I tried it on with a bra and it wouldn't even fit. Im a 32D or 34C depending so I'm not super big chested but I'd say a little above average and I can never wear this because of that :/ super cute so might try a L or XL but i might have to just take the L"
2.0,I din’t like that has a polarized film
2.0,"I’m a 50 year old male , weigh 205lbs and I got to say this mask is a small fit that makes me look more feminine. This is not a flexible mask , It does not bend for a comfortable wear around your face , also the mask presses up against my eyelids that’s not only uncomfortable , but it makes me look old and pathetic  I was looking for something more like a classy mysterious Zorro mask and I guess I came to the wrong place , and it’s not even worth it to send the item back if I have to haggle with the seller - and then pay for return shipping.  I would not recommend these mask for any reason considering they are a cheap uncomfortable one time use only mask that may break on you at anytime.  Plus they don’t fit  Enough said..<br /><br />Other Thoughts:  This mask is shipped in a good thick box with a plastic wrap. .  More than likely people are saying they get a broken mask during delivery because they simple do not like the mask either ,  That way - they won’t have to pay anything to ship the mask back for a full refund.  How do you like them apples."
2.0,Showed up with a broken chain
2.0,"The percentage for &#34;expected size&#34; should be a 50%. If the hat had an actual size, it's defiantly a standard Medium.<br /><br />Overall the color & the style is as listed."
2.0,They say 6+ but they were too small even for my 3 year old.
2.0,Nice earrings but broke after 2 days
2.0,Garter at the hemline is too tight.
2.0,"These only got a 2 star Bc they ARE beautiful however, beads keep falling off every time your head moves. Super disappointed."
2.0,The color was just a bit on the bleached side
2.0,This was given 2 stars because Of the zipper<br />It’s very small and unreliable<br /><br />But the dress is warm and made for Winter/ autumn seasons<br />Size M<br />Weight and height 180/ 5’5
2.0,It took a lot of effort to get these “large” gloves onto my hands and then it turns out the length of them was pointless since they were so tight they only reached less than halfway up my forearm. Unfortunately these gloves will not suit my needs so it’s back to the drawing board.
2.0,The medal is beautiful but did not come with chain as stated. I had to go out and buy matching chain.
2.0,Product did not zip close as expected because too small a fit.
2.0,"I gave this shirt only 2 stars because the sizing is so misleading.  I bought this for a friend who wears a large, bought it in a large, but it's more like a small.  I will be returning this and not sure if I'm going to order a larger size yet.  The shirt is high quality and really cute.  If I do exchange for a larger size, I'll update my review."
2.0,"The detachable shield -- because it is so flexible -- is very bendy and warped when you look thru it making it unusable in any situation where you have to, well, see.  Good idea, but doesn't work.  Too bad because the hat itself is cute."
2.0,The gold was dull and tarnished looking.
2.0,"It is smaller and lighter than I thought.  It is very fragile.  I should have returned it, but I lost it in a few days."
2.0,Extreme thin. Not long lasting.
2.0,"Wore for a few days and literally started coming apart at the seams. Holes in the underarm, around waste band, and neck fold. It's unfortunate because it is nice and soft."
2.0,"These socks are so thin, they should be call nylons....<br />Waist of my money."
2.0,"We bought six of these in different colors for our daughters and nieces, ages 3-9. All the charms were very pretty and nicely done for the price. But all the chains either arrived broken or broke soon after opening. Disappointing for the girls who couldn't put theirs on, and for those who lost their pretty charms when their chains broke as the party was ongoing. It's a shame because the charms were very nice. There must be a quality problem with the chain supplier."
2.0,Material is cheap. Not soft
2.0,"I bought this item for my daughter because i wanted it for christmas but i was a little disappointed because it doesn’t fit ,i bought a large so it would have a little space but it doesn’t fit"
2.0,"Bought these for my 9 year old son for a stocking stuffer for Christmas since he loves Fortnite. They are HUGE. Even after washing them in hopes they’d shrink, nope still massive. They fit snug on my husband! They may work for an older teen (basically a small adult). Asked for a return less refund, and I am going to try to find mask tighteners so maybe we can get use out of them.  Gave it an extra star because of the Fortnite design."
2.0,"Dress fit great but it is completely see through.  Undie lines, tan lines, can see ALL OF IT.  I got a slip to wear under it, problem solved.  I got another color that was opaque, so maybe just an issue with the yellow dress."
2.0,"Dont buy it... Consider it costume Jewelery, or fit for a tween girl who want's to feel like a princess. Not worth a date night outfit though."
2.0,"I ordered the set with black, white, and gray at the last minute so I didn't have time to return when I got the 3-white pack. Otherwise the sucks are fine. My daughter is turning 3 and they fit her well."
2.0,"Update: 3 weeks and 10 uses later, the black band(35 lbs) snapped. Black resistance band was used lightly and still snapped. Overall, disappointed in the quality but can’t do anything about it now.<br /><br />Finally I get resistance bands to workout with. Product arrived super quick and wasn’t delayed like my other resistance band. Quality wise, it not the most durable but does it’s job. The resistance labeled on the bands don’t really feel like 30lbs, 20lb, etc so it’s good that I was able to bunch them up to get a good overall resistance.<br /><br />Overall, not the most durable but does it’s job. Will update this review when one of them breaks!"
2.0,It already turned yellowish
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:2fb495f316c6b79eee2215a6b8b97e37]] Good sparkle, but it wasn't as described. The video tells all, really. Bracelet was super tight on me. The crystals on the necklace were supposed to be black, but were white. I was underwhelmed by the necklace, really. The only thing I liked was how lightweight the earrings were. And no pieces seemed to be broken or missing. They just weren't what they were supposed to be."
2.0,They are massive. I thought they would be smaller
2.0,Size runs small. Jeans are tapered leg. Shirt was thinner than expected and almost seemed a bit feminine in design.
2.0,"Looks nice, but we are just beyond the return date and the zipper broke. Dont buy this product"
2.0,"Love color, design & material. Runs super small. 3x is more like a 1x."
2.0,"Unless I missed something, the description said that these masks had a nose wire.  They do not.  One plastic wedge thing showed up in the box of 5 masks.  That's not going to do a lot of good when we all wear glasses and we're all needing masks.....the masks themselves seem well made, but I am more than disappointed that we're still going to be struggling with visibility when it's cold outside."
2.0,I have a small calf and I could barely get these to fit.  They took a long time to get here since they came from China. If you have big legs I would not buy these. I have not washed them yet so I don't know how they will come out. I would not buy these again due to the size.
2.0,"The product is cute. And before it got cold, it was a great way for my daughter to not lose her gloves. Once it got super cold, and only after about a week, the clip busted and shattered."
2.0,"It’s a no from me.  I’m a slim 5’6”, 129 lbs, and usually wear a size 2-4 or small.  However, I’ve found waistbands on skorts tend to dig in a bit so I ordered a Medium.  The waistband on this skort, while it “appears” wide, has a very thin string-like section at the very top portion of the waistband that is unusually tight and has no elasticity.  As I tried to pull this up over my bum (keeping in mind that I sized up!) it was very tight and I could hear the fabric crackling a bit as it was stretched, so it’s definitely NOT elastic!  Overall, the skirt fit was surprisingly tight, including the under shorts, so you’ll definitely want to try a size (or two!) larger than normal which is always soooo good for your self esteem {insert eye roll here}.  Other things I didn’t care for :<br />-  the length which, even tied up, was a little matronly for my taste but you do you<br />-  the pockets, which didn’t lay smooth (likely because of it running so small)<br />-  those damn little side ties, which tickled my legs, no matter how I tied them!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE :<br />This one is going back."
2.0,The wig is only good for dress up the part looks fake and the color is almost Ronald McDonald. Would have been better if the color wasn't so bright. I ended up giving it to my 7 yr old to play with. So disapointed.
2.0,"It is really well built but the indented tip (you use to catch the edge of the spring bar) is pretty thick.  I have another tool and the tip is way thinner.  Frankly, I find it's too thick to get between the lug and the spring bar so it doesn't work for me unfortunately."
2.0,"It is sold as a men's hakama but the hakama is the skirt type, not the trousers type making it totally useless for kendo, iaido, aikido, kyudo and other budo arts. It's also cut a damn sight smaller than what i would consider to be xl. No mention of the fact that it's a skirt hakama anywhere on the description or reviews. I feel like i got fooled. And annoyingly, the kimono is awesome so i'm probably stuck with the crap hakama unless i wanna return the kimono too - which i don't. Two stars are for how great the kimono is, otherwise it'd be zero."
2.0,Not soft enough and too bulky.
2.0,"The pattern looked different to me in person - I thought the polka dots seemed much larger than the dress in the photo, which made it look kind of dumpy, which is a real shame, because I liked the cut of the dress."
2.0,I like the fit... just really cheap material.
2.0,"This was awful ,didn’t look anything like in picture.I sent it back"
2.0,1. runs small<br />2. fabric is see thru
2.0,"This product material is very, very thin.  Depending on the undergarments you wear with these sweat pants, you will be able to see the undergarments through the sweat pants."
2.0,"Quality of boot was &#34;as expected&#34; for the price but for the larger sizes, I think previous reviewers hit the nail on the head that these boots run at least 1-2 sizes small.<br /><br />I wear an 11-12 in women's (really an 11.5, but US shoe sizes rarely come in that)<br /><br />Based on many other reviewers, I ordered up to a size 12.  As soon as I took them out of the box I could tell they were too small. For the sake of curiosity I tried them on and they were easily 1.5 sizes too small even without a sock on! The boots are also extreme narrow, which was a selling point for me as I have a narrow foot. The width &#34;just fit&#34; my foot, so if you have even slightly wider foot (or maybe even avg), these will definitely not work."
2.0,I had high hopes for these but they get smudged up easily and doesn't get that dark
2.0,"2.5 stars I like the purse, but zipper is already broken and I also use my other purses. I bought it in late May of 2019. It's only been 6 months."
2.0,Shirt folded. The heart on sleeve clearly damaged due to being folded. The iron on transfer already coming off the sleeve from the packaging. Will not purchase again
2.0,This is a very thin leather cuff that does not look like it does in the picture. I returned it.
2.0,It's not big enough for adults...! I give it to my son .<br />You should make it longer with 10 cm at less .....!
2.0,"These glasses are super fun and cute but they do a terrible job of blocking the sun. I was squinting the whole time I had them on. Unfortunately I won't be wearing them on sunny days, I need glasses that actually block the sun."
2.0,Gloves were great to begin with but the velcro on the wrist straps has stopped working after ~6 months. Would not recommend.
2.0,Didn't even fit my watch
2.0,The arms/sleeves run small. Really tight
2.0,very poor fit
2.0,"The earrings were so small, I thought the bag was empty.  The pictures and descripton were not clear.  I thought I was getting all the sizes."
2.0,"Zipper malfunctioned on the first day I wore it.  Comes undone from the bottom up and then very difficult to lower the zipper.  I've stopped using the zipper and use only the velcro patches to keep it closed.  Was on a trip and needed it, so wasn't able to return it.  About what I would have expected for those available at half the cost."
2.0,"Pretty blouse, nice quality but unforgiving runs a good two sizes too small. Returned."
2.0,Not real high quality. the cost to return was more than I paid. Gave to a friend.
2.0,not supportive enough in a larger cup size.  sizing is a bit off.
2.0,"super cute, but way too small"
2.0,Cups gap but the girth is tight. Clasp bites into your skin.
2.0,I am 5'0 and ordered a small. This skort was incredibly short and I could not wear it out because of the fear that my butt cheeks would fall out.
2.0,Not for me... the scarf is trimmed in gold. And the gives the scarf a &#34;cheap&#34; look.
2.0,"They're cute like the pics, but don't stay in your ear."
2.0,Falls off easily.
2.0,Very disappointed looked totally different in person fabric and design.
2.0,The boot broke on the front the first day my partner worn them while hiking.
2.0,This shirt is cute but not true to size. Order at least one size larger and it is a real crop top!
2.0,"This was fun for a couple of weeks of wear, and certainly got some comments, however after less than a month the parts became loose inside the body and it stopped working."
2.0,the dress was not long as in the pic. i didnt like it. i had to give it way
2.0,"The seam where the strap attaches began to unravel from the edge the first time I wore it and the seam burst in the seat of the pants when I bent over. It was not tight otherwise; I intentionally bought an extra-large to make sure it would wear loosely, but there is no give to the fabric and the seam is poorly sewn. If you know how to sew and can run it through a machine to reinforce the hems, it's nice and light for summer."
2.0,The pattern is very cute but the fabric itself isn't very comfortable. I obviously washed it before using it & it still feels a little scratchy on my face. Also didn't like that one side the elastic wasn't properly put on so it looks very poorly/cheaply made. Won't be ordering any other mask from them again. Not satisfied with the craftsmanship.
2.0,I gave it to my daughter on Easter and 5 of us tried to open it we all failed......what the hek why would you make a bracelet so hard to open???? and charge that amount of money. VERY disipointed and angry. You have a lost a costumer forever!!!!<br /><br />Cindy Ventura
2.0,"Nice belt, buckle is heavy but its function is convenient. The problem is that the paint quickly chips off the buckle.  Good for around-the-house."
2.0,Nothing to attach the band was included with this order.  So I now have a band but can't connect it.
2.0,It’s a foam with a printed pineapple on it . I should of looked at the description before I bought it .
2.0,"Does not look like photos. The colored beads are mixed up, so instead of being the same color on each &#34;branch&#34; there are a mix of colors on each. Which definitely doesn't look as nice."
2.0,"For its price don’t expect something different.<br />It just did the job, a little bit press your head from sides because of the hard plastic arm. And it’s size between s/m."
2.0,I did not like  the quality material and this dress is much than shown in picture.
2.0,"Fabric is nice but the quality is eh. Alot of the stitching is loose on the buttons and around the hems. It looks nice but just from one gentle wash I am already going to have to sew buttons back on. Also, I ordered a small and my top runs a little on the big size and the bottoms run small. I could probably wear an XS top and a M bottom. The sizing is awkward. I wouldn't repurchase these."
2.0,"I love the pattern and colors. However, very cheaply made, tore on the first day I wore it."
2.0,Definitely size up in this one.
2.0,Nice bag but the handles are too short to be used for a shoulder bag and it was way too big.
2.0,Ribbon part of necklace tore within first week :/
2.0,a lot smaller than seems! I ordered this necklace for my love of amber thinking it would be a lot larger but when it arrived I was so surprised how small it was!
2.0,"I was completely unhappy with the material and texture of this top. I didn’t wear it once. The style is great, but that’s it. I donated it."
2.0,"after 2 months of just walking around inside my home, with hard wood floors and some carpeting, part of the bottom fell apart."
2.0,So disappointed! So many good reviews and I seem to have gotten a dud. I gave it two stars because the gold does match the Apple Watch 4 Gold Aluminum. But the leather feels and looks cheap and it’s damaged or just made incorrectly on the two sides. I will be returning ☹️
2.0,Fit large. Too big for my head.
2.0,I'm take size 34 jean and they were so loose my pants would not stay up even after I tightened my belt so tight it hurt.<br /><br />Also thought the elastic band was very lacking.
2.0,"It's too small eventhough it was their""large"" size"
2.0,"Very poor material. The outside is smooth, but the inside is harsh against your skin. The waistband is also twisted and super uncomfortable."
2.0,"Fit as expected, but the fluffy bottom part of the dress hits in a weird spot."
2.0,As a big man I like the 2X dry fit shirts. I like a loose fit. These shirts a made for a slender build. There was no give to the somewhat thin material and the length on the shirts seemed short compared to other brands. I will say I like the style of the shirt. These shirts are extremely light weight.
2.0,Disliked the fit . Lining will stick if you sweat .
2.0,Bar is small
2.0,"The dress fits on top and arms, but the lower half very very wide."
2.0,"These are very cheap looking, very plastic, very stiff. Not nice at all."
2.0,This dress may work for someone very thin but not for curvier figures. The dress' band is right below the breast which makes the bottom of the dress fall rather awkwardly. The bottom half doesnt give  your body much &#34;shape&#34;. The top is beautiful though.
2.0,"The eyelets fall out like crazy! ALL of them! On BOTH boots!  Causing loose shoe strings and almost falling down.  I will be attempting to glue the eyelets in or find better eyelets that fit.  Please be careful if you buy these! Otherwise, nice comfy boot."
2.0,"I liked these socks enough to buy them a 2nd time: I like the wool blend, and the offered colors which can brighten Fall & Winter days. However, with both purchases the top elastic band, after several hours of wear tends to irritate the skin such that it is very uncomfortable. I don't know what the elastic band is made of. I am allergic to latex.<br />I would not recommend them to anyone who has any sort of swelling in the feet, which I have after several hours on my feet. Even with the slightest swelling, I've experienced itching, and a desire to remove the socks. This is distracting and disappointing. I would not buy them again."
2.0,Terrible fit and feel. Spend the extra money and buy a better quality tank
2.0,"I THOUGHT I ORDER SIZE 32 BUT GOT A 30 INCH WAIST, BUT I SHOULD OF GOT A 34 INCH WAIST. CUZ THOSE WERE WAY TO SMALL."
2.0,Not as advertised.  No underwire.
2.0,"This item came into contact with a magnet and adhered to the magnet.  I continued and discovered the only part of the bracelet and necklace that is not magnetized is Lobster Claw clasp and the 925 Silver tag.  Inder $7,for 925, sterling was too good to be true."
2.0,They are not men size
2.0,"I almost gave it only one star but it seems like a super comfy dress...I say ‘SEEMS’ like, because it’s so insanely long I can’t actually wear it!<br />I’m a petite 5’3”, about 120lbs, and ordered a size SMALL & no joke, the hem landed well past my knees-about 2”-3” above my ANKLES!!! Maybe it was a fluke or a dud, but if not....I suggest grabbing one of the many others just like it from another, more consistent seller."
2.0,Beautiful dress just really small. I'm a 38D and large would not even close.
2.0,"Pants are beautiful, but they are VERY STATIC-y... I hate clothes like this and wouldn't have gotten them if I had realized this. The material isn't worth the price."
2.0,VERY SHORT
2.0,"It seemed to be well made, really warm, I like the sleeves. The problem was the plaids did not match in front. I like to sew, so I am going to cover the jacket with plain material because the price was good, not worth returning."
2.0,"I'm 5'-6"" and normally wears size M which suits me well. But this t-shirt is slightly long and what I dislike most is the large hole for the neck. It's ludicrous."
2.0,"they had denim full seat patch, not a sueded material to help you stick to the saddle<br />so I will return them."
2.0,"First of all, I specifically ordered this dress because it was described as RAYON and spandex, but it is actually polyester and spandex.  I HATE polyester and won't wear it because it makes me smell bad, so I will have to return this.  Additionally, and I do know that screens make things look omewhat different (though usually on my phone, from where I ordered, colors are fairly true...), but the colors in their picture were very muted and the colors of the dress are not muted at all, they're quite bright and don't suit me one bit.<br /><br />As to fit, it fit very well. I ordered the 2xl to be sure I had chest and shoulder room as I'm 5'9"", 245lbs, very broad shoulders and strong upper body and wear a 38ddd. I had planned to wear it with leggings, as I'm 43 and not small or dainty, and it worked well with leggings (several inches above my knees), though it was not terribly flattering. I could have used a more wide open v-neck, since I am so broad-chested, this dress had a fairly small v neck, which may suit others just fine.<br /><br />It seems fairly well made, is very soft, but it isn't at all what I was looking for, unfortunately."
2.0,I really don’t recommend this product. The sizing was definitely way too small and the color is off.
2.0,"The sweater is comfy and soft, but it arrived with a tiny hole in the wrist, and the sleeves are HUGE. Like, you have to have arms like The Rock to fill out the sleeves on this thing. It's such an odd mix. The sweater is all perfectly proportioned, then the sleeves are GIANT."
2.0,Instructions refer to a non extant button for code setting. Poor
2.0,"I wanted to give this a five star review, but the openings of these socks have loose strings that pull out the sewing.  The bottoms leave pieces of the fuzz all over my bed.  I am a bit disappointed.  I also saw nothing on the package about vitamin E and lavender.  They seem to be simply socks."
2.0,"Joggers are comfy and fit well, but while I was wearing it for the first time the stitched-on rainbow side came unstitched in a section."
2.0,Pretty sleazy fabric....picture is way more better looking than the actual product.
2.0,Price for 2 belts and color
2.0,Very cheaply made.  Too small & way too long.  Will give it away!
2.0,The front zipper pocket fell apart after only a few months use. Guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Very unique style!  When I saw this listing on Amazon, I had thought it might be a thick, sweatshirt-weight material.  I was pleasantly surprised to find its a lighter weight than I had thought.  The style is different than any others I’ve seen.  It has old corset-style stays vertically along the lower hip and waist area, then the shirt widens out around the bust and shoulders.  It has dropped shoulder sleeves and the long sleeves are full and extend down to the wrist.  It also has an attached hood.<br /><br />I’ve always had to buy shirts in XL because my shoulders are broad.  I end up buying jackets in size 16, pants in size 12.  I’m 5’7” and weigh 160, so  average weight. This is the first time I’ve ever had to buy XXL, based on the size chart.  So glad I sized up because the lower fitted portion just fits, and the shoulders have room to spare.  If you carry your weight through the middle or hips, this jacket may be a problem.  I chose the “burgundy” shade but its a color which I call crimson, or a dark red.<br /><br />For this next part, I’ll refer to it as it fits ME.  It could fit differently on others, but I tend to think it will be the same on you, too..  This jacket is designed to be worn while standing up only.  Not kidding!  When the jacket is zipped up, the stays are pinched between hips and breasts, and they bow outward so it makes me look HUGE.  When sitting, I instantly look 80 lbs heavier.  Honestly I’m not nearly as big as I look in the last pic.  And I’m actually long-waisted.  I can’t imagine how this would look on someone much shorter.  While sitting, the stays aren’t uncomfortable but they do displace breasts up, not a pretty sight.  Notice that in the Amazon listing, none of the models are sitting.<br /><br />Be very careful with sizing.  Order up.  This is really designed for women with slimmer hips and waist and for those who never sit!  What a shame, I really wanted to like this jacket.  Maybe it would look good on a super-slim 20-year-old model, but looks terrible on me."
2.0,The chamois pad irritated...appears to be an uneven finishing stitch on both sides. After a 20 mile bike and 5 mile run had bad chafing spots on both sides
2.0,"These are adult sizes, not girls or juniors as advertised."
2.0,I didn’t like the material nor the fit.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:1af7e3b99546ceaffe6c9c20f32e0b68]] Today is the 4th of July. I wanted my little one to be able to wear this dress, but it has a hole in it. For the price, I would expect better quality. If it was $5, I wouldn’t be upset about a hole. However, at $17, I expect more.<br />I’m giving 2 stars because it’s a cute dress. The fit is great. My daughter wears a 6. So this was perfect as far as fit goes. It Just sucks that the material isn’t better quality."
2.0,"I'm really disappointed. The skirt is described as ""colored denim."" It is NOT DENIM, it is more like twill. I previously purchased a black denim bendover skirt that was truly denim. Loved it and ordered the green one. I'm just glad I didn't order the purple skirt at the same time. Needless to say, I will be NOT ordering the purple skirt. Isn't it against the law to not deliver on what is advertised?"
2.0,SEE NO DIFFERENCE
2.0,These beanies are for toddlers. I have a normal sized man head and these things fit like a 99 cent store condom. Now only that every time I take it off there is all kinda of beanie pieces in my hair. If I take it off I looks all dumb with all kinda of fabric stuck in my hair. Out of 6 beanies only one fit me properly.
2.0,"The item shown at the time I purchased was a single mesh bracelet and claimed it was 'large', up to 10.82"" wrist circumference. What arrived is a two piece bracelet that is smaller than claimed. I measured it. At best, it might reach 9.5"" including the watch itself.<br /><br />That means if you have a hand at the end of your wrist, it is going to be hard to get your watch on or off without either removing your hand (troublesome and painful) or disconnecting the ends of the two piece bracelet. That makes the thing kind of useless, the point of a watch strap like this is that you can take it off or put it on without having to fiddle with a clasp like on other ones. So this is going back."
2.0,"I love the look of it, it feels great but it got scratched up really quick and looked awful, then the pin fell out of one of the links and it fell off and i almost lost it."
2.0,"I am 5'7, 165 lbs, 36 D and wear a 12 or larger. The large was way too tight in the chest but fit everywhere else."
2.0,I look like a sack of potatoes in this dress. It's much brighter in person. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,Fabric is so soft but overall its too short
2.0,"This top would be cute if wasn't so defective. The one I received has a hole in the seam the goes down the center of the back. I really liked the sleeves, but they are much shorter in person than the pic on the model leads you to believe. You can see by the pic I posted that the front label doesn't match up evenly with the V Neck which means it wasn't sewn properly. Very disappointed. I'm returning it. Blessings"
2.0,Purple. Definitely not dusty blue. The fabric looks cheap.
2.0,"The corkscrew end is really small. If you have a nose on the &#34;larger&#34; side of things, these may not be for you."
2.0,The people who make these clearly never put one on.<br />Like canvas and will easily suffocate you in short order ....it bad enough we have to wear masks
2.0,Ordered these and they are just about impossible to put on. The center ball does not screw it simply has two very shallow grooves for the center ball to &#34;hook&#34; to the rest of the ring. Before even being able to put one of the earrings in the ball would not stay in place so it fell out and it no where to be found. Would have returned if that piece hadn't fallen out.
2.0,"The fit is accurate, but this is sheer, cheap material. You can see a bra through it as clear as daylight, so make sure it coordinates with the shirt color. It hasn't been worn more than once and already has runs in the fabric. Not good quality."
2.0,It would have been better to have directions on how they worked. I have not used this type of earrings before.<br /><br />I might return them.
2.0,The quantity was not as expected and also stitches are coming off right in the middle legs
2.0,"Fit too small,  seem to pill  quickly"
2.0,"It does give effect I was looking for, but no other complaints."
2.0,"more like a costume tie, vs a skinny professional tie.  not a bad product, I think i just had too high of expectations."
2.0,"Too small and very than, you can see through it. Go up a size or two bigger."
2.0,These fit nice and are super soft but ripped in 2 spots the 2nd time I wore them. I'm super disappointed.
2.0,It's not quite what I expected.  The fabric is very light.  My body shade does not work with this skirt.
2.0,The 2x was cut more like a large
2.0,I hate giving poor reviews. But this blazer (bought in three colors) is so cheap that I refuse to wear them. Bought them as a casual work outfit but they are horrid! The material is perhaps a half step above sweat shirt material. I'm truly saddened that I have to write this review but others should be warned.
2.0,they were small and i have fat finger and my friends counldnt even fit them on
2.0,"I was extremely disappointed in these tanks. They're advertised as long tanks, but they barely hit the pant line. They are made of a very thin material that rolls easily. There is no compression aspect to this product. Overall extremely disappointed in this product and disappointed that it doesn't hold up to any of the qualities it advertised."
2.0,"Way too small, even thought I purchased the extra large. Can't imagine what a small looks like!"
2.0,Scarf was too big for my girl.<br />It would fit me
2.0,nice beanie but too small for an adult
2.0,"I know that I shouldn't expect to be identical but at least decent look. The chain looks more lopsided than symmetry. The fridge aren't the right length for each side. If you use it for personal then no biggie. But for gift or sale, definitely not gonna happen. I looks everywhere for this type of earrings for sale because I couldn't find it until I came across this item. I had high hope but it is a miss. It not easy taking photos for each one so you can get general idea what it looks like up close."
2.0,I wanted these to use as liners to use under my wrist braces.  they are very small.
2.0,"It was folded in half,  very cheap!"
2.0,The jewelry was bigger then expected but I received my money back with no problem.
2.0,"These are adorable but they are not soft material so I couldnt maneuver my little one's foot inside. I loved them, but unfortunately she never wore them because of this."
2.0,Very tight in the forearms. I would say that I have very average size forearms. This shirt cuts off my circulation.
2.0,See through... I was hoping I could use these as leggings but you could see right through them. They are probably fine in other colors.
2.0,I should have ordered a size down. The tops are too big on me. I like the design though.
2.0,Had to return it. Too small for me
2.0,Very low cut on my 9yr old. Had to rubber-band the back to keep it in place.
2.0,Super cute but a crop top
2.0,Beautiful shirt. It’s very well made not thin. But it doesn’t fit. Pretty disappointed.
2.0,"Color was peachy, not pink at all."
2.0,didn't think they would be as thick as they are.<br />Very thick
2.0,"Too small, cheap cut and fabric.  Gave it away."
2.0,Looks fancy but not happy with the material and finishing. Oxidized triangle in the center (refer the picture) Not very much like the product picture. Not to forget somewhat large for my hands.
2.0,"Super cute, but I opened the package and tried it on and the dress just fell apart all the way across the back on one of the stripes"
2.0,"Comfortable, true to size, seem like good quality. Wore them while shoveling snow, and now hands are stained with dye from the gloves. Stains remain even after thoroughly washing hands."
2.0,"The Halife Women's Peplum Tops Dressy Casual Elastic Tie Waist Button Down Blouse is a very nice, lightweight blouse. I love it on me. It is my favorite color and the design is very flattering. That's why I was really bummed discovering the inexact stitching in the waist. That really ruined my impression. Yes, I have sewn it but I can tell, it looks bad. It is just hard to repair that kind of spot and on top with this really fine fabric.<br />The blouse is true to size, I wear my regular size M (5'7"" and 140 pounds)."
2.0,Smaller than size indicated.  I wear a large but thought I'd order the XL since made a broad. The XL still runs small! Can NOT button up fully all the way.
2.0,"Purchased according to their size chart, which fits up to 5'7&#34; and 130 lbs.  My daughter is 5'4&#34; and 125 lbs and a size 2-4.  This did not fit her.  She could not get it past her thighs.  Had to return it."
2.0,"Swimsuit is cute, but missing a strap."
2.0,A bit uncomfortable...
2.0,The material is extremely thin you can see right through it. Very poor quality.
2.0,Was made out of very thin material and it was shorter than expected. It is not for anyone taller than 5'6&#34;.
2.0,Will send back do not like color
2.0,Whitney Houston look to dark in the picture.  It's a nice shirt but the picture looks dark.
2.0,"Got this for my daughter but it was really long on her and really big.  She is 5'4""<br /> My other daughter tried it on and it was still long,  she's 5'6"". They liked the pockets and the color was as described."
2.0,"The dress would be great if the fabric were thicker. I can see every line of my underwear. I am 5'4"" 125lb and got the medium. It is big enough, just shows everything through the dress. It is going back."
2.0,"This top doesn't fit like it's pictured. It fits like a men's undershirt. It's a thick, shiny polyester fabric that is sort of stiff. The color was like a reddish burnt orange. It wasn't cute on, so I sent it back."
2.0,"I bought this as a slip to go under a maxi dress that was a little too sheer in the skirt. While this fit, there is a 3+ inch hole in the side of the chemise at the seam which I didn't notice till I put it on while on vacation. Thankfully, because the slip is under the dress, it isn't that big of a deal. But note that the chemise is VERY thin and gave just enough coverage to work for me as a slip. While this was the best option I had in a pinch, the $16 I paid was way too high for the quality I was given."
2.0,"Stem-winder knob broke off after less than a week.  Don't know how, just gone; can see broken stem.  Looks great and kept time."
2.0,"I bought these to replace an almost identical pair I bought several years ago.  I wear a 9.5 - 10 and these fit perfectly.  I am thinking of buying another pair as a backup.  Great price and product along with a quick delivery.  No complaints.<br />---------------------<br />20 days later.  The back, right seam stitching is coming loose and starting to separate.  I can assure you I have not &#34;abused&#34; these slippers.  I just wear them around the house at night.  I would contact the seller for a replacement but I can't find a link on the site.  They are still well liked but falling apart is not good.  -- R.D."
2.0,I ordered in S size but looks bigger maybe like a M size or even L. I'm going to sell it
2.0,"Didn’t like these at all. After wearing just a few hours, they make the bridge of my nose hurt. Will not buy again. They do adhere well. Just too painful to wear."
2.0,WAYYYYY to big. Not fitted at all like the picture. If you are small or petite do not buy.
2.0,"The arms do not stretch out much, but overall cuteee dress!"
2.0,"I bought this product previously in red and white stripe, and the gray and navy strip.  I ordered again in black and gray, along with navy and white, and both are drastically smaller than my previous order a few months ago.  I my original order, I loved how loose and comfy these shirts were.  However the 2 I received today are drastically smaller.  You can see in the photo how much shorter and narrower they are.  Both were equally smaller.  I almost looks like a child size version of my other two I have already. (All are the ""one size fits all"").  These are being returned."
2.0,Go to Nordstrom rack and get a $24 pair of nikes or adidis. This shoe didn’t hold up very well. Trash after a month of wear. Elastic stretched out and fabric pilling and fuzzed.
2.0,don't like ties and too tight
2.0,"It's flimsy, knit-like material, almost like a jersey t shirt. Not what I was hoping for at all. It's a muted, grayish light faded looking  blue...I'm disappointed in Lands End. I can 't believe I paid so much for this loathesome shirt. Ugh!!"
2.0,"Hair ties will not stay on the bangle.  They slide right off.  I tried all three, and none of them would hold the tie.  It always ends up around my wrist, not around the bracelet."
2.0,"I would like to exchange this product for a size smaller (I got a  medium and apparently need a small). I really love it other than this, but there doesn't seem to be an exchange option for this dress, and since I got it on sale I'd like that price to still be honored. I may just return it at this point..."
2.0,"Really love the ring, but I wore it once for less than twenty minutes and the chain broke off."
2.0,"I'm disappointed due to the fact it could fit a 16, and I'm a size 16 and it didn't fit, and it was very much too short. I was planning to wear it to a comic book convention."
2.0,Quality ok<br />Ran small
2.0,"I love the look of this bracelet but, the small ball that should hold it in place continuously slides and does not secure the bracelet in place."
2.0,Too thin and smaller than I thought
2.0,What was delivered was labeled a medium but was most definitely larger than a medium!
2.0,"Very disappointed in this fit.  I loved this top, and ordered it 2 sizes bigger than my size so it would hang.  I could barley get my arm in the sleeves.  Very disappointed 😔😞😞"
2.0,The arms are way too short...like 3/4 sleeves on me and I am pretty small.  It's not fitted like in the picture.
2.0,"Cheap sunglasses, what do you expect? I received the sunglasses with a leg bent outside. It was not that bad, so i bent it back with my hand to wear them. The flip up sunglasses lens are fragile, and i hope it will not break, but i am sure it will break in soon, but i wont return it b/c i cant find any good ones at lower pirce. If you want decent flip up sunglasses you have to pay more than 100 bucks. Btw sunglasses look good, it looks just as the picture but the shade is not that great."
2.0,These were fine except for the fact that every Lembrança was cut in half.  These should wrap around your wrist twice.
2.0,"Not what I expected. Material looks bland, dull, cheap and inferior. This is no steal. Got what u paid for."
2.0,These are extremely cute and comfy but the polarized stuff scratched off so easy. Haven’t had them very long or wore them Everyday and I had to buy a new pair already.
2.0,Its beautiful and well made but short. I dont think it fit around a lot of adult women wrists. Can't use and neither can my sister or friend. Have to return or donate.
2.0,The sizing on these is way off. The tops are very short and the sizing runs very small.
2.0,This product is very misleading for the size. I get it was suppose to be a somewhat slouching beanie but it should be this big. Here is a comparison to my other beanies and how it looks on me. It says way too much. I have another slouch beanie and it doesn't do what this one does. Description needs more detailed I formation. Possibly what the product looks like on a person's head and have different size options.
2.0,The inside band breaks off the bracelets. Lost 4 so far. Be careful when you wear them.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:446895acd7f7247604b6c36feb7672c0]] The bracelet is cute with its crystals glittering all the time. It sparkles even brighter when light hits it. I choose the rose gold bracelet as it looked the most elegant. At a cost of less than $10, this seemed liked a good buy and I considered buying the other styles. However, after wearing the bracelet for a few hours on the first day, I notice one of the crystal was missing. The prongs that holds the crystals needs to be more secure."
2.0,"The material felt really thin and cheap. I was hoping the shoulders would fit properly because the dress was so cute, but they do not stay up. You have to wear this dress as an off the shoulder dress. Otherwise, it fit as expected."
2.0,I wanted to like this but the arch system chafes.
2.0,Cute jeans but the button broke the first time I wore them
2.0,"these are listed as overknee, but I couldn't even get them *TO* my thigh. they're bright and beautiful sure, but they don't stretch. if you managed to get these up to your thigh, they'd either rip or you'd tear your flesh trying to pull them up. Its sad cuz they're so pretty and the material itself is really soft and comfortable, but impossible to put on."
2.0,Very cheap looking and quality.
2.0,I Was Thinking 3XL would Be Perfect but this Shirt fits like an XL!
2.0,Very thin material. I don't know how helpful it is
2.0,"All plastic frames, hinges break too easy."
2.0,"After 1 week, it fades ALOT<br />I do not recommend, unless you're wearing this only once.."
2.0,I refound because is to large for my watch my watch is for women and is 18mm
2.0,Too big and not worth returning.
2.0,Cut very high. Didn’t look good on
2.0,Didn’t like the quality and to small.
2.0,"The only thing wrong with this glove is it has spandex in it and I'm extremely allergic to that material.  I don't remember seeing it in the description of the glove.  Otherwise, you can't go wrong with Isotoner."
2.0,The colors are NOTHING like on the picture they have! Bought it thinking it would be like how it is in the pic but it came out to be a lighter blue not a royal blue or dark blue. The paisley designs are the good thing that came out of the lanyard. Other than that I wasn’t a fan of it. And the white paint is already coming off from when you put your Keys 🤦‍♀️
2.0,"I was not expecting this charm/pendant to have diamond cuts to it. I am not a fan of this type of finish to any gold piece. The picture does not adequately show this, nor does the item description mention any diamond cuts to the piece. I am, however pleased with the size of the piece. It is as described and the bail is a good size."
2.0,Its said shiny black and the real color is blue....
2.0,Beautiful but broke so easily! So unhappy!
2.0,No I don't like it to small an it's not leather.
2.0,"The bottom of this dress is perfect but the chest area is terrible. The cut is so odd!! I feel if you don’t have a large chest area then this would work okay for you, but I wear a medium and have a larger chest area and the fit of the top of the dress is terrible on me. :("
2.0,Pretty simple pieces of elastic with slits in them. Could’ve just bought from the craft store and made them myself. *shrugs*
2.0,Order came missing a bandana for the kids. Package says 4 pack but only 3 came trying to get in contact with the company. Other then that the mask fit well on the kids and they really like them.
2.0,Quality was ok. The problem i had was that the designs weren’t fully centered onto the masks so some of them looked a little weird
2.0,The fabric is much thicker and stiffer than the picture. It isn't flowy or easy to tuck I'm.
2.0,"the pretty one is way to small, the opal glass one is plastic and the other one is so sharp and tight it hurts to wear it.. but what do you expect for the price"
2.0,It tore within the 1st two weeks of purchase along the zipper. I should've purchased the higher priced one.
2.0,"The balls are so tiny and hard to see, That I cant even find the hole, and even if I do, I cant hold onto it to screw in/ pop on.(its hard to tell if these even screw or just kind of push on) IF you can find the hole, Pliers help to hold it, but takes me like an hour just to put one ball on. Not easy when you need an MRI, and have 12 piercings. Some of them even came undone after getting them put on. I also lost many balls in the process cause they are too tiny to hold or see.  I had ordered acrylic industrial barbells at the same time, and the balls were much much bigger and easier to deal with."
2.0,Blue color came off metal bar 😞
2.0,"I have many 3mm gloves and these are the worst for colder weather. Idk what it is, but they let the cold in easily. I did like the feel though and comfort"
2.0,"Despite the pictures, this industrial really looks like crap you'd get at Claire's Boutique. The &#34;gems&#34; are tacky and tend to fall out. Would not recommend. I ended up removing the crappy pink pieces of plastic and gluing in natural amethyst stones. Looks MUCH better! Oh, these are a little hard to insert, as they screw together at the decorative center part. Thus, you have 3 pieces: 2 bar ends and a decorative center. The center doesn't rotate, so screwing in the bars was a bit of a struggle. No infection or other issues, so I assume that the metal is of decent quality."
2.0,"looks clunky. lots of metal. you see more metal than you do diamonds. i took it to my jeweler who confirmed it was incredible value, definitely better than they could give me. it just didn't sparkle like a diamond bracelet should. i ended up purchasing a different/more expensive bracelet with better diamond clarity and less metal - this really made a difference. One more thing - the links were very stiff - some of them were stuck together and you had to manually move them. I imagine that over time things would loosen up, but at the same time this isn't something most people would wear everyday."
2.0,"Looks cute in the picture, but is a hot mess in real life. Really cheap fabric, everything seems to just lay wrong and look nothing like it does in the picture. It took a long time to arrive, and I was pretty disappointed."
2.0,Colors and pattern NOT as pictured. Returning mine.
2.0,Criss cross area was super far apart.. One movement from nip slip. Also I'm on the shorter side (5'2&#34;) and swimsuit felt very short on me
2.0,"Got as a Christmas gift.  Not as expected.  Very cheep looking and the posts are way too thick and very uncomfortable.  Wore them once, probably waon't wear them again.  Not a good choice."
2.0,The material feels and looks like a Halloween costume. Terrible quality & the fit is awkward.
2.0,The plastic is thin. To be of any use they need to be stuffed with newsprint. I ended up buying a couple plastic ‘cutting boards’ and trimming them to fit the boot-they are much stiffer and work better.
2.0,The Logo is wearing off .
2.0,I brought a 44C the cup was huge.  Love the bra but had to send it back.
2.0,"This dress was just what I was looking for to wear for an event. It was very flattering, excellent color choices and comfortable to wear. I was very pleased with it until I washed it. I washed it by hand, inside-out using a mild detergent and hung it to dry. The dress looks terrible now.<br />All of the color dye on the edges of the dress (bottom hem, sleeves) disappeared and now appear white in color which is a stark contrast to the deep green of the rest of the dress. Super disappointing."
2.0,"When I first tried this on, it seemed to fit really nicely. The fabric is of good quality and comfortable. BUT, after wearing twice, it stretched out terribly...especially the bra area. Now I am constantly adjusting it to""hold everything in"". :)It also rides up a lot in the tummy area. It's too bad because it's really pretty but, not functional. I am 5'4"", 145 lbs. I ordered a large. Perhaps if I ordered a medium it would have been better, but the fact that it stretched out so quickly makes me question the quality."
2.0,The leg seam frayed after the first wash.  Wish it didn't because they were very comfortable.
2.0,"I wound up giving this to my little girl, who is 11 - definitely not designed for a woman's body."
2.0,"I usually am borderline between medium and large but when the reviews said to order a size up, I got the XL just in case. I couldn’t even pull the skirt up over my thighs... I had to give the skirt to my mom who is usually maybe a size 4 at the most. The inside of the skirt said XL size 8 and it fits her well. I gave it two stars because it’s still cute."
2.0,too small. had to return.
2.0,Too small and there was a discoloration in the print.
2.0,Very bendy...
2.0,Weird fit. Was flowy in areas that should have been more flattering
2.0,Very cute. Good material.. But the belt did not come with the dress. That was kind of the feature that made me want the dress.. But I'll make due with a brown belt. Navy blue is beautiful. Love the French stripes
2.0,The brown is a much darker brown that shown in the photo; and the glasses are primarily made more for women than a man. I was excited initially about these glasses however ultimately was overall disappointed with the female shape and look once I received them.<br /><br />For under $7 I can't complain and gave them to a female coworker instead.
2.0,Nice shades was just sent the wrong ones a day before I was flying out on vacation.
2.0,"These are described as antifog, but they are not. They fog up exactly the same way that the cheap goggles provided at work. I feel like I wasted my money and time on this purchase. For that reason, I don't recommend this product."
2.0,So many threads inside could even get them on without toes getting caught. Will not stretch at all.
2.0,"Did not like the feel of the leather, but gloves fit properly."
2.0,Returned - wanted something warmer.
2.0,The shoe was beautiful from a far but when you take a closer look at the heel it looks like they glued a piece of wood to the shoe and glued rhinestones on the shoe. It was not wrap on the heel because you can see the wood through the gaps on the heel. I ordered them for my bridemaids and the shoes had them crying in pain. No support at all. If I would had enough time I would have sent them back. They run very small. Not a good choice.
2.0,I had to return them. They were way too small. Very disappointing.
2.0,"Can’t say I liked, never worn. At least 2 sixes too BIG. Returned"
2.0,"Unfortunately, I had the experience that other reviews had where the pattern inside was so pretty and the pattern in the outside way not so much. The seems make it awkward to wear inside out. The fit is good, but the pattern is what drew me to the top the most."
2.0,cheap flimsy. waste of money
2.0,Center stone fell out even before had a chance to take it out of the package that it came in. Returned it for a refund
2.0,Beautiful bracelet arrived on time but turned my wrist green.
2.0,I took a chance on this dress and it did not pay off. The dress was too small in the bust and arms. I was also annoyed to see that someone never finished sewing the one pocket on.
2.0,I have ordered these twice. Each time the right earpiece broke in the hinge when putting them on. Same side. Would have really liked these to work. Darn!
2.0,"These are too stiff, very uncomfortable. Dont even think of bending down to pick something up..."
2.0,Poor quality jeans... but you can't complain for the cheap price.. are swap meet material jeans.. good for a couple wears..
2.0,"Purchased for my 5 year old a size 6-8, she wears a size 6 in everything else with room to grow, but this 6-8 is very snug, barely wanted to zip, couldn't get the hood on it was so tight and seem ripped. I had to order another 2 sizes up and pay for express shipping to have it in time for Halloween."
2.0,"Worn for one month and has a hole it the front and not water resistant at all!!! I wouldn't describe as &#34;work&#34; boots, more as leisure wear!"
2.0,The space where the Fitbit hose needs to be smaller it didn’t even fit!
2.0,"The fit was great, but the rose petals are not sewn onto the shirt & they all stick up and look extremely weird. If that was fixed, I would've loved the shirt."
2.0,"I like the material but the color is not quite what I expected. I expected a more beige or khaki color but it seems to have a hint of yellow. also around the back of the shoulder/neck does not lay flat so it looks weird. Ill likely just use this as an ""around the house"" item and not wear it out."
2.0,"Paper thin material, wrinkle heavy, even once ironed looked crappy, provides limited shape to body just poofy"
2.0,"Color is perfect. However, the reason I bought this sweater is for the length.<br />It is much shorter than pictured."
2.0,I was disappointed in this sweater. The sizing is very small. The weight of it is barely heavier than a tshirt.
2.0,Too small. I ordered a XXL and gave it to my sister who usually wears a M/L
2.0,Fit way too small
2.0,"I ORDERED THE SIZE THAT WAS SUGGESTED ON THE TESLA WEBSIGHT BUT IT WAS NOT CORRECT, I NEEDED I SIZE LARGER<br />OTHER WISE THE QUALITY WAS GOOD."
2.0,"It was cute while it lasted. But, It broke off after a few days."
2.0,crystal face scratched almost immediately
2.0,The hair tie doesn't consistently stay in the bracelet :-(
2.0,Poorly made. Back seams rolled out to show lining. Front looked droopy. I'm returning it.
2.0,The nose piece broke off within a week!
2.0,Once washed they were more wrinkled than my mother could tolerate and she can’t stand long enough to iron any more. Kept one of the 3 pair she ordered to just wear around the house. Would not be considered a dressy enough outfit for anyone to wear to a party or office attire.
2.0,Ran unusually small.
2.0,The bracelet is gorgeous! It wasn't until AFTER I had it engraved and beautifully boxed that I realized the clasp was BROKEN! I could SCREAM!
2.0,No me gusto la tela
2.0,This is a very heavy fabric and will be very hot I’m sending it back
2.0,Not the same brand as purchased.
2.0,Top handle of backpack broke the first time my daughter brought it to school
2.0,This was suggested as compression gear. It is not compression gear. It's basically a undershirt. I ordered 2 sizes smaller than my tshirt size.
2.0,"Very cheaply made, snags my scarves..."
2.0,The charm was very pretty but the charm came unconnected from the necklace.
2.0,They tend to move far too much!
2.0,"It doesn't stay put, the material tends to slide down and requires readjusting"
2.0,"Quality of the piece is fine, but this isn't the greatest design.<br /><br />It's very hard to get the strap on and off if you want to adjust the length.<br /><br />After this I always look for one where the belt hole peg is hinged."
2.0,Loved the material and that they were light weight. Huge for a toddler size. More like for a 1st or 2nd grader...which is not a toddler
2.0,"Runs very small. The 5 1\2 fit more like a 4 1\2. They are advertised as man made leather. They look like man made leather. I don't see these as breathable or comfortable, they are so stiff, but with time maybe They would loosen up.<br />They have a multipurpose sole that might be a draw for some for a non metal spiked athletic shoe."
2.0,"Very large - it will swallow your face.  The folds engulf most of rhe text.  What it doesn't is under your chin and thus also unreadable.<br /><br />It was a cute idea, but not for this mask style, and I can't be bothered to alter it, so it will eventually land in a trash can withot ever being worn."
2.0,"Giving 2 stars because I love the underwear and have bought them multiple times but for some reason this time, though the label was xl they were 2 sizes to small."
2.0,"The material is polyester and has an elongated crotch area. I am much too thin to make thin outfit look cute.....5'6, 135lbs. I returned it."
2.0,These run very small. My daughter is usually a size 6 in all other shoes; I ordered her the 7/8 pair as suggested by other reviewers and her toes are still right at the edge. The sole of the shoe has no flexibility and they're very slippery. The strap also doesn't have much length to it. I won't be buying these again but since they just fit (barely) I'm not going through the hassle of returning the ones we received either.
2.0,"This is clearly my own personal opinion of the fabric choice used to make this garment.  I was expecting a standard T-shirt like a Hanes Beefy T, but was delivered a shirt made of something similar to satin.  Probably will never wear it simply because it's just not my style."
2.0,These are not seamless leggings. There is a seam that runs the entire inseam to the ankle. I usually wear a size 4 and these were too large with loose wrinkles.
2.0,Very disappointed. I simply loved the quote as proud Marine mom but the sizing was disappointing. Normally as a curvey woman an XL fits just fine. Unfortunately I was so excited to get the shirt and wear it I ripped the packaging open and wore it only for it to keep creeping up on me. I washed it and tummbled it in the dryer a few minutes and it looks even smaller.  First time I have been disappointed in a purchase
2.0,Rubber band broke a week into having it
2.0,Used the measurements in the chart when ordering  and it was too small
2.0,I honestly never wore this I really just tried it on for giggles it looks like a cheap shag rug I hate the way it looks
2.0,"The color online looked very rich and warm, but when I received it, it was just a regular ole brown. Disappointed to say the least."
2.0,They are nice and well made. Problem is the earrings are pretty stiff and it's hard to align the post to the tiny hoop hole. Can't wear them.
2.0,Look better in the picture
2.0,"Cheap, very high waisted and they don’t help your figure at all. Not a fan"
2.0,"This bathing suit is good quality and sexy but the top is not adjustable at all. The strap around the chest has one hook and the arm straps are one set length. I got a small and the bottom fit great but if you have a smaller top portion, the top probably won’t work for you. Shame since I loved the style!"
2.0,The fabric material os too thin. Nice relaxing wear however.
2.0,Wasn't completely satisfied but it was a suit but I want something else
2.0,They are of good quality but extremely small. I had to give them away. Very disappointed!
2.0,This material is CHEAP.
2.0,Wore one time and the material has a run/tear in the crotch area<br />Material almost see through<br />Colors are rich in color
2.0,This product does not fit my head as pictured. It fit much tighter. Knowing I have a smaller than average head circumference I find this upsetting.
2.0,They material is real costumey.... plastic like..
2.0,"Way To big item to use on a bracelet, my intentions where to dril a hole and use on a bracelet but it's to complicated they, product is really good design"
2.0,"I should have paid attention to the reviews warning about the fit.<br /><br />I got it in the size I usually wear, large. In practice, I actually go back and forth between medium and large so I thought the large would be good for me.<br /><br />But when I put the jacket on for the first (and only) time, as soon as I moved my arms, the jacket was destroyed.<br /><br />The hat is fine. The gloves are tight.<br /><br />As other reviewers have recommended, if you get this, go at least one size larger than you think you need."
2.0,"cheaply made, completely seethrough, looks nothing like the picture. i dont trust this product and dont plan on using it because it looks like it could rip at any time. the onlt thing i found good was the size. fit nicely (i'm 5'3, 128lb's). its a little below my ankles but not long enought to step on it."
2.0,The item were not very well described.
2.0,Dissatisfied with the thinness of the material and unexpected color received.
2.0,"Looks cheap, Disappointed."
2.0,It's kinda cheesy
2.0,"It was a struggle to put together, the instructions are not very helpful, Looks to be used already. All it does when you plug it in it makes this quiet weird static/ radio noise and the adapter got kinda hot quickly. It does nothing else. Closeoutsp i believe is a place where they sell returned items/ broken items. Will try and fix it, I think the wires are shorting out somehow. I've never seen this before on any animatronic so, going to try my best to fix the problem. Then maybe I'll change the rating.<br /><br />*UPDATE* Returned for a new one.<br />*Apr 29 2022*: Got refunded full amount because there was none left, Dont buy this item."
2.0,"The sleeves are too short, the back comes way up, like above the waist line. I am on the shorter side (5ft 3in). The description does not say or show 3/4 sleeves. This is just poorly made. It *is* warm. So, if you want to buy a $20 cardigan to wear around the house to keep warm, this is a good option. I haven’t washed it, but i don’t see that going well. The tag says to hand wash."
2.0,"Love the bracelet, but disappointed because the &#34;h&#34; in Hakuna is faded/rubbed off."
2.0,"It was difficult to take the links out since I didn't recieve that tool kit that easy supposed to come with it. I'very wore it three times, and the  pins in the links won't stay in it. So, it keeps coming apart and falling off"
2.0,I did not last an entire day. The ribbon broke off from the Cape. It needs a hook so that there is not a stress on the ribbon.
2.0,"The cosmic violet color is see through. I am going to have to return it. So disappointing, because it fits me great and the pattern is so cute."
2.0,The product runs very small.  I am a 16.  I bought a 1X and it was too small<br />The fabric is very nice.
2.0,After reading the reviews I went with Xl I usually wear Xl or 1x . Xl usually runs on the tighter side for me so I figured this would work. Well there is no compression what so ever. And it’s extremely short. It’s not right and the material is very thin . It’s very comfortable. Not what I was looking for.
2.0,Initially I gave this product 5 stars but only having it for a little over a month I must lower my rating. The stitching at the top of the bag is pulling loose. It's a shame because overall the bag seems durable aside from this problem.
2.0,"don't buy it!  Looks very nice, but after couple months of use, the lining started to come unglued! Next time I'll buy something that has stitching on the edges instead of just glue!"
2.0,"Looks very nice, it’s simple and comes with a replacement battery but is very poorly made. The hinge part where it connects the bands popped off on me for no reason. when I tried to assemble it again I struggled only for it to pop out the pin again, will go to a place to get it fixed but if the fix cost more than the watch itself sadly to say this watch is going to the trash."
2.0,Too small. Low quality.
2.0,"The good: It is pretty and enchanting. You can wear it with or without your ears pierced.<br />BUT<br />The bad: It is clearly defective. 2 stones were off without even taking it out of the box. It does not seat well on the ear. And, in my opinion it does not complement the ear (at least not mine).<br />I returned it."
2.0,It started leaving bubbling after first use.
2.0,These are very comfortable pants. The fit is nice. However they are VERY see through!<br /><br />UPDATE: After owning for a while and several washes later these don’t hold up as expected. The material has started pulling. :(
2.0,"Quality and fit is wonderful! Unfortunately not what I ordered though! I ordered this in purple, but it was navy blue. Clearly not purple, as you can see in the picture! I only ordered it because I needed a purple hat! Disappointed to say the least, but will not be going through the hassle of returning it. Been there, done that!"
2.0,"Purchase with caution. I like the design of the band clasp, but the color is not as pictured. The picture indicated that the band was a dark wine, reddish-purple color. The band I received was a dark Ravens purple not a hint of the wine reds in the color. Purple is not a practical color that Ito wear and I am not very happy to be misled."
2.0,"This bracelet looks cheap, big, and bulky. Not for me."
2.0,It does not fit my ear no matter what I do gave it to my neighbor.
2.0,"Just, no.  They looked like those pom poms you could get from the craft store.  Gave them to my younger cousin."
2.0,"It's a great jacket, but only,  it's definitely not for winter. I wish you would have made that point more clear to the buyer! The jacket is perfect for a 9 year old boy. He loved it,  n all the design on it.  But definitely an early spring or fall jacket."
2.0,Does not stay together. Has a small that hasn't went away
2.0,"No problem with the cover up, just not to my liking.  Will be returning it."
2.0,"Seam is in front, right up the middle, making pattern not match. Looks cheap"
2.0,They are actually red in colour.  Hence I am returning as I was looking for dark burgundy
2.0,Bought this pant thinking it would be skinny but somewhat fits like a medium..not really a small.
2.0,for so called plus size. Its tight on my size 8 bottom
2.0,"I have lost 100 lbs over the last year, but the top band on these socks were so tight they bruised my leg just below the knee. And, these are supposed to be ""graduated"" compression. I think I would love the socks if not for the tight top band."
2.0,"When I opened the package there was a tear on the back side of the shirt. :( Fabric has NO give to it at all! Sizing chart is not accurate by a larger size, I even bought a size larger and it is still smaller that I would like. I am returning the shirt."
2.0,They are fine. As advertised . Nice but the shipping was a pain and a half. Kept sending them back as no one was here to sign.  What are they ? Top secret ? Who in the h*'ll should have to sign for legbwarmers . Unnecessary delays and running all over the county to get them . Almost not worth the hastle.
2.0,"This is a very nice hat, although the material could be upgraded. But....this hat is not for me! I put it on and my husband couldn't stop laughing! I wanted a hat to protect my scalp, face and ears and it does that, but not on my head! I returned it."
2.0,"Very disappointing. Much larger and flatter than it appears in photo. Maybe nice for a young girl as it is pretty, just not what I expected for the price. Not happy that the company will charge me for shipping the return. Any other returns are free and just dropped off at a Kohls location. Doesn't feel like Amazon order."
2.0,"This blouse looks almost nothing like the photo.  There is very little shirring on the side and no shirring at the bottom.  It's a basic black blouse made from inexpensive material. I returned it.  I may have kept it to wear around the house if I only paid $7-8, but this was $17 and not worth the money."
2.0,The straps are so annoying that it isn’t even worth the hassle.
2.0,This bra is extremely uncomfortable and pinches my back fat.
2.0,"This band is not compatible with my Garmin Forerunner 25. Though I was able to use it as a replacement band, it does not fit flush with the sides of the watch."
2.0,Runs big and the print seems like it will melt if put in the dryer. Returned.
2.0,The shorts ride up and in general doesn't move well while working out.
2.0,"I usually wear a solid 2x and an occasional 3x. The skirt fit well, covered up my problem stomach area. However, the jacket does NOT fit at all! I read other reviews that mentioned the sizing on the jacket but thought &#34;that was just them&#34;. Don't be that person, dont be me. You May need to order a few sizes larger. The material looks cotton but is actually a cotton/satin blend. The Colors are vibrant and outfit is beautiful, just sizing off."
2.0,I really wanted to love this top.  I have a lot of Jess and Jane tops and I have loved them all but I found this Christmas top to be disappointing.  There are no rhinestones and the fabric is thinner than you would expect for a top costing more than $50.  After washing; it was very wrinkled and the pockets drooped.  ☹️
2.0,"Larger than expected. Heavy and clunky. I ordered two, one arrived broken, both were seriously tangled.  Shipped directly from China, took weeks to arrive.  Disappointing all around."
2.0,"I do not like this product. It is too cumbersome and really uncomfortable.  To look at,it looks nice.  If it can be light weight and fit comfortably around the neck it would be an awesome piece but it feels like a barrel around the neck. Designer please rethink this"
2.0,I had to return they run big
2.0,Two stars for trying. Item was too small and too thin. I wear a forever 21 small / fashion nova small. This was smaller !!’ I do love the print and was so devastated when I put the item on.
2.0,Notes are marked only one side and i takes quite a bit more effort ( air) to produce the desidered sound than another that I have that is in a different range.
2.0,"Pretty, a bit small but the wires were so far apart & so thin, even after squeezing together, both fell out. 1 is lost. Wore 2 hours @ home watching TV. 😣"
2.0,was not long enough and could have been softer
2.0,"Colors are great but cheaper, then material. I just added it to my donation bag."
2.0,it is just ok
2.0,I didn't find this tool useful in assembling the bracelet. Not worth buying. We found toothpicks worked much better than using this assembly tool.
2.0,"The top of turtleneck is unfinished (cut fabric) and low quality.  Seams on each side of the neck and shirt.  The turtleneck end is tacked to seams on each side.  Not sure which is front or back of the shirt. The inside of shirt is unmarked and no obvious difference in a material amount of fabric between front and back.  Stretchy, soft material, and runs small.  Not sure how this well this shirt will wear or wash.<br />Update: washed but does not want to dry. Placed in Dryer with a load, load removed but shirt still damp. Ran for additional 15 minutes still not dry.<br />I would not repurchase this item."
2.0,"Ordered the &#34;black and white&#34; color. What I received looked more like the pink, black and white set shown in the low-res grainy pictures in the ad.  Except the pink parts were faded a bit.  Not happy.  Will be returning."
2.0,"I love the look of this band however, it is not durable.  The end of the band that is permanently anchored/glued to the clip popped out."
2.0,I wanted to love this bad. I was so excited to finally find something big enough to hold my stuff and my kids things in too. Two days of use the zipper broke. It won't stay shut. Other than that it's a great bag. I just should have listened to the other reviews that said &#34;zipper broke&#34;.
2.0,"Cheap, you get what you paid for."
2.0,"Beautiful watch. Advertised as ""waterproof"". Wore once in shower and it fogged up."
2.0,The shirt was nice however way too small.
2.0,"Fits tighter than expected but ok. Ordered larger size too. Real problem is the neckline is quite high, not at all as pictured and fabric is pretty thin. Can see white bra. Sure I can wear a different bra. I'm saying this only to give you an idea of fabric used. I love the neckline pictured!  Too bad. Probably going back. Ordered another color coming in a couple days. I'll see if that is any different before deciding on return. May be ok as swimsuit cover up for upcoming vacation.  If that's the case I would only keep one of them."
2.0,Very thin.  Need to use two at a time.
2.0,"I had to send this skirt back. It ran waaaayy to small and I was very disappointed. The color was true to the picture though, and the material felt nice."
2.0,"Decent looking, fits true to size. Returned because there was a few holes in the seams."
2.0,"Great material, but very tight in the ""package area"""
2.0,"Very disappointed.  First day my son wore them to play in the water, the shoe was peeling, scuffed up and beginning to fall apart. Such a cute shoe, but really upset with the poor quality."
2.0,The silver has already come off the band after 3 weeks
2.0,I sent this back due to color and size was all wrong! Might be cut in a different color. I’m five foot 4 inches with olive skin and the color was not good for me.
2.0,"I bought these pants for two reasons. They looked cute in pictures and the reviews were glowing. I was disappointed in person. I expected to be able to wear them in both professional and casual settings. But they fit like a pair of skintight yoga pants. They definitely can't be worn to work. You might be able to get away with it if worn with a long sweater and boots, but these pants also don't have pockets. That makes them really inconvenient for me.<br />I also didn't like the way they looked on. In the product photos and customer review photos, they look cute and whimsical. But in person, I felt like I just looked really...twee. My sister said I looked like I was playing an elf in a Christmas play. Good thing it doesn't come in green! Maybe I would have liked them more if I could've gotten black, instead of red. But I don't care enough to wait for them to come back in stock. I will be returning these."
2.0,Not as pretty in person and stone was larger then expected but nice for the price
2.0,"The product matched the description. When I first received it, I thought to myself what a good deal. However, my satisfaction evaporated when I couldn't remove one of the chain links so it would fit my wrist. The product comes with an easy to use tool to remove the links. The problem is the screw connecting the links was so tight it broke the tool. It even broke my personal jewelry tool I had. I tried to contact the seller to get help as I really wanted to salvage the deal, but the response I got was to return it. Perhaps, I just got a bad lemon and had I ordered another it would have worked with no problems. I found another deal and moved on."
2.0,Looked nothing like the photo in the ad.  Fridge all around. Does not make a proper hood for my cosplay. Unsatisfied.
2.0,Drawstring binds when drawn to tighten.
2.0,"The goggles fir well but, you see double vision."
2.0,Constantly having to place arm of glasses back into croakies
2.0,"I bought this dress in part based on the great reviews, especially the ones with pictures. Also, because I have one I purchased from another brand in a different color that I really liked. This one showed up and was very thin material I could see before ever removing it from the packaging. I tried it on and it was a hard No for me. Every bump, lump, and curve was accentuated and not in a good way. I had zero thoughts on returning it. It was so unflattering and I just can't reccomend it. I'm kind of wondering if I had been sent the wrong product because the reviews and user photos were completely different than what I got. I also went based off similar height/weight and Amazon's recommended size guide. I'm 5'6, about 183-187lbs, and ordered an X-Large. It didn't look good on me, but others in that range I noticed, looked fine. Could just be a *me* thing."
2.0,Like it ok but no slits to pass one end through. Will order hopefully will have an opening
2.0,"Too Small, I wear a 38 waist boxer. Nice and light. Would be fair for the price if they fit. Unfortunately for me I unbagged all 12 before I tried one on. Some times I do stupid things."
2.0,"The fabric is cheap and the shape is weird: if you’re not fit, this is a very unforgiving piece. You’ll also be cold if you wore this in the California winter weather and it’s not even that cold here."
2.0,Didn't hold up as well as I'd hoped. Hinge wore out so doesn't stay tight anymore. Looked great while they lasted.
2.0,I ordered the XXL but it is very small.  Donated it to my wife's pre-K class for dress up.  Not kidding.
2.0,The vest was cheaply made but everything else was fine
2.0,Tongue is held on by one thread on these sneakers and ripped out after 1st use. Sewing it back in with fishing line since the sneaker was needed that day. Now looking for another brand.<br />Rest of the sneaker was acceptable quality.
2.0,It really cute but I bought it because it look like it unbuttons and it doesn’t they aren’t functional. They fabric seemed to bee good quality but I sent it back since it wasn’t what I expected.
2.0,It's a very nice poncho ( for a 10 year old)......It is seriously way too small for any woman who does not have &#34; hobbit like&#34; proportions.  I'm trying to stretch it out with weights to lenghthen it.  I hate to return stuff.
2.0,"Good fit, outer material is sturdy, well insulated and waterproof.  However the Velcro on one boot broke within the first month of wear, and my son only got to wear them a total of maybe a dozen times. The edge of Velcro is so close to thread line there is no way to fix them unless you had an industrial sewing machine which I do not."
2.0,"I love that this item is exactly how it looks but the only thing I did not like is that when I received the item it was damaged with wholes inside the shirt, I would like a refund or an exchange on my item."
2.0,It’s cute and colorful but material is kind of thin. Didn’t feel it was worth the price
2.0,"Otherwise,  the gloves are Ok."
2.0,The design and the material is good but it’s tooooooo see through. I were a skin colored bra under this and it still showed. Can’t really wear it
2.0,This size fit a lil too snug im a size lx and this didn’t work for me
2.0,Junk not real don't waste your money!
2.0,I like the look of these earrings but the picture is very misleading.  I had read in the reviews that they were lightweight but didn't expect them to be quite this light.  Several reviews mentioned the flimsiness of the hinge on the hoop and I can see this breaking quite easily.  I kept them but I wouldn't order anymore of this brand because the quality is quite low.
2.0,Supposed to have arrived in a velvet pouch but came in a plastic bag makes me wonder if I got a cheaper version. The overall appearance was much duller  than it looked in the pictures it was a disappointment for $100.
2.0,"I've been having really great luck with Delimira bras from Amazon lately, I have this exact style in a few other colors.  Not sure what happened with this one though, I always wash bras before wearing them and this one shrunk up at least one band size.  Didn't have any issue with the other colors."
2.0,This dress was sooooo pretty. The slit was perfect (not too high) and the cape was beautiful and well made but the bust was so small it gave me square uni-boob...so I returned it.
2.0,I did not receive what was pictured. Their is no flip in the wallet as shown in the picture. It is definitely a trifold wallet. No flip.
2.0,"I do like the attached earplugs.  However, the goggles fog up CONSTANTLY and leak a bit.  Not bad, but could be a lot better"
2.0,"The UPS truck hadn’t been gone 10 minutes after I opened my rings and GINGERLY tried to open one a bit to put on, it almost broke off! These felt like they came out of a bubble gum machine! I gave it 2 stars for the tops, they are cute, but that doesn’t help if they break! I should have read closer to what these are made of. Disappointed in Amazon as well as the seller, I thought Amazon was more careful of what/who they sell for!"
2.0,"As someone who is 5'10"", this product was just barely touching my ankles, so it didn't fall like in the picture.  Also, the material isn't cotton, like it looks in the picture. It is a synthetic stretchy material, like cheap leggings. Not what I wanted."
2.0,Cute fit bit so thin & seams coming apart runs slightly small
2.0,"Way too large for the average face. Was hoping for a Janis Joplin style, didn't happen"
2.0,One of the lenses was popped out when it arrived. It was really difficult to get the lense back into the frame.
2.0,Tiny i normally wear a large or 14 in bottoms and ordered the xl and they will barely go over my butt.
2.0,Looked like weird striped pajamas - returned
2.0,Unfortunately
2.0,Strap broke on shoe when toddler tried to tighten.
2.0,It change color and too big.
2.0,"Reviews said it was really large so I went down a size and it's still TOO big but the shoulders are almost too small but acceptable, so unfortunately if I went down in size again I'm worried the shoulders would be too small or arm length too short.. its wearable, but not like the pic unfortunately."
2.0,Shouldn't there be some type of quality control on making sure not only there are 2 boots in the box but that they are the opposite feet?<br />Christmas gift arrived 10 days late as it was (probably many factors for this) but then to have this happen. Very disappointing.<br />Add in the sizing thing is a bigger issue than it appeared. Why not just redo your sizing chart on the shoes? If people say it fits like a size 8 call it a size 8 and not a size 9. Seems pretty simple.<br />Boots did look really nice though!
2.0,Love love this dress and the pockets. There was a hole in the seem between the top pink fabric and the bottom floral fabric. Otherwise would have given 5 stars
2.0,Fit not standard
2.0,"its a very very pretty shirt i ordered extra big, but it is like a childs large shirt, i am 5 2 and weight 150 , i could not even get it on at all, way way way to small, it seems to be made nice and the colors are beautiful , but if your at all of woman shape dont buy , very disappointed . the shipping came fast enough, all these shirts always come in a wad in a bag. i guess to save shipping from over seas, but just hang up and wrinkles fall out it is a super soft blend, I am going to have to donate the shirt or find a grandkid to wear it,"
2.0,"Pants for as expected but top was much smaller  than anticipated, would recommend just sizing up overall."
2.0,Not made for thick necks. I've lost some weight and now they fit better.
2.0,Deceiving photos. Doesn't look like this in person.
2.0,the material is very soft but the shape didn't fit me well.  It has a straight shape compared to loose fitting tank tops.
2.0,"This is a lot thinner, and a lot more snug than I anticipated. You can almost see through it."
2.0,I returned it. It wasn’t the quality that I wanted to wear . I didn’t like the attachment clips either . You get what you pay for.
2.0,There was no way the scrapes were going to stay behind my shoulders. Poor design.
2.0,"Was very small. I ordered the largest size which according to the size chart, would have been too big and it barely went past my waist. Would not recommend"
2.0,Didnt buy for the front bulge.. like wtf? Didnt read that part. Lost weight and my butt so thought I would try these. Im 6' 175lbs. Bought a XL and its way to small.  Waste of another few more dollars...
2.0,Dress has no pockets which is sad because that's the main reason I purchased it. It also has a fume smell to it. Otherwise cute.
2.0,Love these but the bottom started falling a part immediately!!! This is a statement shoe so you want people to stare at them but not when the shoe is falling a part!
2.0,"I purchased these for my niece's birthday, but unfortunately I was sent the wrong size. Make sure you get the right size sent before gifting them, unlike myself. On the upside, they are so adorable."
2.0,Disappointed.  They run extremely small
2.0,"It’s a a tan color not pink, uncomfortable plastic material. Fits like a bag, size small is good on sleeve length, but too big on the bottom, even when tucked in it doesn’t look elegant."
2.0,Material stretched so tightly that color and design is faded and blurred. Front portion of shoe almost white and porous due to small amount of material having been pulled to meet the front of the shoe.
2.0,"Not at all what I was expecting. This is tiny compared to photos and hollow, with an unfinished back. Small, cheap and weak. I'm very disappointed."
2.0,Looks totally different when you get it. Material ver thin and size is small. Go a size up.
2.0,Should keep Tag in better.  Needs to be uniformed size.
2.0,WAYYYY TOO BIG for the average wrist. It is too small to wrap 3 times but WAY TOO BIG to only wrap twice. Otherwise it’s a beautiful band.
2.0,"Es cómoda pero semi transparente... no adecuada para vestir, pero es ok para estar en casa. Soy ""busty"" así que en mi talla queda stretch en la parte alta y un poco suelta en la parte baja."
2.0,not enough room for credit cards
2.0,Not good quality and runs small.
2.0,"This &#34;set&#34; seemed like it was too different sizes put together.  The pants were very skinny and tight, and the top was huge.  Also the material was vey thin and the seems were fraying the moment I took it out of the package.  Returned item for refund."
2.0,The arms were really tight . I had to return it .
2.0,"While the bird and flowers are precisely cut and a cute graphic, the overall design of the necklace is off. Even on the shortest loop the hang length is way too long. It would look much better at 16-20”, but instead it goes down to the top of my cleavage. Also, it doesn’t look like any specific metal. It’s highly reflective, almost mirror-like, which I don’t consider a good thing. I suppose if it were brushed or textured metal, and shorter, it would be okay."
2.0,Literally came covered in animal hair. Dog or cat or something... I don't even know what to say.
2.0,love the earrings comfortable but one earring came broken<br />very disappointed<br />I sent  them back
2.0,"Disappointed, too big and flowy, no shape to it at all. Couldn't even tell which was front/back. There was no tag and both sides are identical."
2.0,The dress was super cute online but it definitely runs small.  If you are curvy it stretches the material too much making it see through and blurring the flowers.
2.0,Very cheap looking poor quality not worth $29.00
2.0,Too loose and material too clinging want to return send label
2.0,"Mabuchi motor or not, this is not a quiet watch winder. At least the one we received isn't. Has a raspy clicking noise quite noticeable in the bedroom at night."
2.0,"Nice wallet but credit card pockets are too small.<br />Looking at previous reviews, this is a common complaint for more than a year and very easy to verify.<br />Obvious the manufacturer does not care to correct.<br />Sending it back."
2.0,"These are good, just keep in mind they only have grip on the bottom, not double sided like the hospital gives you, so you can flip it."
2.0,The ring is amazing beautiful but cheaply mad broke shortly after purchase
2.0,Very small but pretty.i love it.
2.0,"Great looking watch. I chose the brand because of reputation and its web cite which states &#34;precision is my inspiration.&#34; This would have been the most expensive watch I ever owned.  I was disappointed upon first glance, not as to its looks, but because the second hand was not striking the numerals and the second marks exactly.  Perhaps to others this is not a big deal but it was a deal killer for me.  I called the seller and their rep said this was &#34;normal.&#34;  Again, for me, this was not going to work.  Consider also I was considering the purchase of other Raymond Weil watches that were more expensive.  Not now."
2.0,This dress was not flattering for my full figure. Just to much fabric for me to have alterations. If your good at seemtress this could bea beautiful dress.
2.0,"Ok so, these are just Ok. I wouldn’t get them again. I got a size XL. I am 5’6 and apprx 180. I wear a size Large to XL in leggings. I normally will get XL as I did to be safe.<br />These are a tad too tight on me to begin with. The material is not Fleece inside the lining. These leggings are literally just a tad thicker than your average cotton leggings. There’s nothing real special about these. And, the sides have those lines going up and down the sides of the legs and I hate that! They get twisted and sometimes hard to adjust because they are so tight. I’m hoping I can stretch them out somewhat. But, I wouldn’t recommend these. Not for the price and the material."
2.0,"Trate de utilizar en New York, pero muy pequeños se salen"
2.0,Looks and feels good… slightly inconvenient when you’re working out… or even watching tv and your watch falls off because the clip let’s go. And I’m not talking about the fastener that works fine. The clip where it attaches to the watch housing fails randomly.
2.0,"The crown is 50% larger than it should be, if you want to wear it. One of the horn joints was molded wrong, so it didn’t fix, unless you shaved it down"
2.0,Not very flattering at all. Material looks very cheap. Nothing like photo on model. Disappointed!
2.0,"Bought size 13, fits as expected. The look good barring some small defects such as dye on the light part of the sole and a weird hole on the toe. The reason it gets two stars is for the stench of the dye or materials used.<br /><br />It's been several weeks since I bought these shoes and I've febreezed, sprayed vodka, and left the shoes outside for  couple of weeks to air out. I've even gone as far as washing the shoe strings hoping that would help. These steps have done some good but there's still some smell left. I'm apprehensive about wearing these again since the last time I wore them to work, one of my co-workers asked what that &#34;strong chemical smell&#34; was. Embarrassing."
2.0,"My daughter chose this for her Halloween costume. Wanted to love it, but she disliked how easily it fell off her head, how weighted it felt, how the battery compartment inside the hat would get stuck in her hair, how middle part of hat would go sideways and couldn't be kept upright. I hated how the brand's logo was in big letters in the back."
2.0,"Very small for the size. Can't wear it.  The top is quite see through, which doesn't show on the picture. Sending back."
2.0,kinda ok
2.0,"The beautiful US Polo Association does not hold up well in a dryer or the machine for that matter. Hand wash them or the lettering will melt off, leaving a yellow hint of the design."
2.0,Not easy to adjust on your wrist
2.0,"The clasp does not work. But it's a nice, piece of jewelry.  I will keep it, not worth paying postage to return it.  Maybe more merchandise control from the seller?"
2.0,Good fit and comfort. Too hot for Summer.
2.0,"I got these for my son that's 7 the fit was perfect and he loved them. But the first time he wore 2 of them the elastic broke during school.  He only has one left already, very disappointed."
2.0,"So I've had these earrings for about 2 months now. I usually have metal balls but I liked these because of the color options. The other day I was driving and I felt something falling to my ear. I have three piercings on my left ear and the top cartilage one, that ball came loose. While I was driving I was trying to screw it back in, It completely shattered. I'm not strong and I didn't think I was squeezing it that hard, but it shattered into three pieces. I think I need to go back to my metal balls. I usually have difficulty screwing them on but these were harder than normal for me. I like the actual bar, but the balls are terrible! I definitely don't recommend if you have strong grip."
2.0,😢
2.0,"They're ok, but they don't look like the picture! They are much thinner and cheap looking."
2.0,Very thin and flimsy material.  I was expecting something a little sturdier.  It's headed for the trash can.  Would cost more to return it than to just pitch it and write it up as a bad experience.
2.0,Dont like the way it rolls up around the thighs
2.0,"I loved this band when I purchased it. I liked the style, fit and ease of use. I did have a reaction to whatever it is made out of, so unfortunately cannot wear it. I stopped wearing it for awhile and tried again with the same outcome. Nope, not for me."
2.0,I loved the print of this romper however the material was like cheap satin. Too shiny for my taste. Had to return.
2.0,"These are really cute, soft and breathable but are SUPER thin. I'm sure they offer no protection...  returning as I was looking for a replacement for a cloth mask and I don't think this will suffice."
2.0,"I bought the red plaid tie, but it's not actually red.  It's almost like various shades of something between red and pink.  I never would have bought it if I knew the actual color."
2.0,The earrings were cute and lightweight. The only problem was one of the eyes was missing on the peacock.  You can't really tell when they are on though. I can't complain with the small price.
2.0,"I replaced the necklace with a silver box chain.<br />The pendant is simple.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks it begun discoloring. I tried to just clean it with a cloth, but that did not help. I did warm water and soap. Unfortunately, the pendant has turned very dark."
2.0,I am a US small. These were tight for me. The Beige color is much darker than what is shown.
2.0,"I bought these for my Pandora bracelet to keep charms from moving too much and although they do the job of keeping the charms in place, as you accquire more charms and have to move them around, these stoppers are so tight, they are difficult to take on and off the bracelet, and a jeweler told me I could break my bracelet by tugging so hard on it.  I keep them in the same place for now, and they have retained their silver color with occasional polishing with my anti tarnish cloth."
2.0,Cute dress.......Cheap material!<br />Looks like a Halloween costume.
2.0,The child's medium was WAY too small for my eight year old. She also likes a looser fit and this fabric would have been tight even in the right size. I need to see about returning it.
2.0,"Don't let the picture fool you.  I am 5'5"" and 153 pounds and typically wear a Large and ordered a Large and the pants were so, so long it was ridiculous.  I mean, several inches long, not just one or two.  Perhaps that's the fashion, I'm just not into tripping or picking up dirt as I walk."
2.0,These do not form a seal around my face at all and if you tug on the straps they pop off.
2.0,These are honestly the worst things ever they don’t fit my sons head what so ever. The strap doesn’t even work I’m so disappointed in this I put my sons lenses in them and now he’s stuck with them wish I could get my money back or a better pair
2.0,"This is pretty, and it fits, however, there is some mis-matched sewing at the top. So that a big chunk of the white lining shows up on one side. Either i cut it and re-sew that part, which i don't have time for, or i live with it."
2.0,"quality seemed fine, but the xl ran very small"
2.0,It is a fake watch... it runs at moments and the wristband is some kind of pressed paper
2.0,"While its an ok piece, nothing about it let you know this was big & bulky. Nothing delicate or femine about it. If you're giving it to a guy to wear it may be ok."
2.0,"Posts were very thick, make my ears hurt (I have very small holes)-but beautiful!"
2.0,This product is lightweight but after 1 wash begun to roll up at the ends would not purchase again
2.0,Ok so the shoe is as expected however I have only worn (lightly) them twice since I got them. I was just looking at them and the honeycomb on both shoes are separating from the sole👀😳. So this is a fail.
2.0,Runs large! The jumpsuit was nice with rhinestones but it’s very hard to find a bra. Wish it came as a 2p with bra
2.0,Ordered this hat/scarf/mask set because liked the idea of the built in mask. Well it just came in the mail and there wasn't a mask in the bag. Hat fits good so I'll keep it. But disappointed the mask wasn't included as advertised.
2.0,The dress is cute in picture only. Runs small. Couldn't even get it over my head to try on.
2.0,"Beautiful shoes however, the size 2 fits exactly. His big toe touched the top of the shoe hence an exact fit to size. The tread is very slippery for an active 7yr old boy."
2.0,"Warm and good looking, but after only a few uses started losing stitching. Also, too much air gets in thumbs even when texting flaps closed."
2.0,"These leggings were way too small. I’m going to give it to my daughter-in-law. Hopefully, it will fit her."
2.0,Supposed to be 81/2<br />Feels more like a 9
2.0,This item did not come in time for St. Patrick's Day so I was sad. I will save it for next year and hope that it doesn't get lost.
2.0,"The color of the green amethyst is barely visible ....not like pictured at all.  If I had known that it had to be returned in 30 days, I would have done so.  Even an instore credit would've been nice.  Never again."
2.0,Didn't look good at all
2.0,Lady’s the shoes are beautiful but the heels are super weak.
2.0,"My girlfriend loved it. That's why I gave it more than 1 star. The stupid ring broke in less than 2 weeks. After it broke, the inside looked more like plastic than sterling silver to me but i might be wrong. If you never need to adjust it, then I think you'll be fine. The box it came in was cute as well."
2.0,Kinda off... tassels are uneven but I like the design will wear at night or no one might not notice
2.0,Two of the shirts had holes at the seams. Very thin material.
2.0,Red is fire engine red. The picture looked darker. Way red
2.0,"I thought these pants would be great for my 8-year old daughter.  She is petite, with long legs.  They were so tight she could not even do a squat.  They do have a very sexy look to them.  I wish they had been larger.  (I bought the 9-10 size 140)"
2.0,Ordered these pants twice. Same size different length. The first pair got perfect they have a little stretch which makes them comfortable. These have no stretch and cut smaller in the waist. Not as comfortable. Didn’t try them on first before the only difference was suppose to be the length. So now I’m stuck with them
2.0,I gave this 2 stars because they are okay but not the earrings that are pictured. I didn't even get the ones from other customer pictures. These I could by near home and would not have to wait so long for them. I'm disappointed.
2.0,"I loved the size of this, but on the first use, the straps broke off, and the zipper busted."
2.0,After only wearing these boots for 2 hours and not even on my feet I got a blister they didn’t feel comfortable for me I hope the same isn’t with you but be prepared you just might get a blister
2.0,"These are gorgeous sunglasses and they haven't broken yet, which is amazing. However, they fall off of my face every time I move and I appear to be allergic to the metal nose pieces. I have a rash on my nose now which is very unflattering. Very disappointing."
2.0,It's bigger than you think
2.0,"For this price it should come in a box. The hole that fits the clasp is too delicate so it will break off.<br />Very thin metal, overpriced for what you get. I was expecting thicker silver for this price. I'm returning. Looks attractive, but lacks quality."
2.0,Wrinkle easily too big
2.0,This was basically see through. And the flap on the top that makes it asymmetrical can be seen under the dress. You need a slip to wear this. Not the most quality fabric. Just thin spandex. It looks okay but not sure I’d wear it out.
2.0,The shirt was smaller than expected and the shirt collar was uneven.
2.0,For skinny people
2.0,"Although she loved this while it lasted, it was short lived. This sweatshirt lasted only a couple month. Gifted on Christmas and thrown out end of February. Is not durable and material thinned and tore after only 3 washes."
2.0,Pants fot well but had poor sewing on mesh I needed to sew to keep them in place shirt is extremely large ! With all that said I love the pants but I got ride of the shirt.
2.0,Sent this back not very well made
2.0,Sent the wrong size
2.0,"I should have known that the price was too good to be true.  This seemed like a cheap knockoff and not the real deal.  The stitching was messy and the fabric was not the same quality as the real jersey.  I purchased the real one from the manufacturer and the difference was easy to see.  If you're looking for an inexpensive replica USWNT jersey, this will pass from a distance but not upon closer inspection."
2.0,Fit waaaaaay too tight around the arch. No give or stretch. This was before i washed them. They also smelled like they were exposed to water and had mildew odor and some on the packaging. I wouldnt recommend this as a gift. Fit even tighter after i washed them. Great for boots or around the house.
2.0,"Different size bears--small and then smaller.  Couple were broken, two were stuck together and couldn't come apart. 5 or 6 pieces unusable."
2.0,"These were meant to be reading glasses, the frame is so heavy that after a while my nose bridge starts to hurt."
2.0,Stitching came out at the shoulders before it was even washed.
2.0,The dress is not flowing like the pictures. It is made fitted all the way down. And the buttons are not made very well and look like they will not hold. I was excited about this dress. But I was extremely disappointed. The lace is pretty so I gave it 2 stars for that.
2.0,too heavy too long the color aren't the same as its looks in the picture . what i got was more of green gray kind of color . what ever it is far from that brown color in the picture . and again message for Amazon allow us to add note to the seller while checking out just to confirm with them
2.0,"Very thin chain, finish on charm turned color very quickly (within 2 wearings). Would not recommend."
2.0,"If you wear US size 16, go up a size.  Could not get up past my hips. Good quality, unfortunately too small."
2.0,Sizes are not USA
2.0,Unexpected! Way too big for me. I always have small but for this small is like large for me...
2.0,These are just okay. Them seem pretty cheap and are extremely hard to screw on. I bought the smallest size and regret it so much because you can barely even see them when they are in.
2.0,"Loved the style, but the dress is a little too short and smaller than expected"
2.0,To long of a bill on it.
2.0,Fabric was cheap looking and smelled of chemicals.
2.0,"won't fit hm, too small"
2.0,I sent this back because I didn't like how it fit
2.0,I am a Republican and finally a President I support but side stitching was impossible to remove.
2.0,"I liked the way these looked. They’re bigger than most, but well within the range of acceptable sizes for cuff links. If you’re wearing cuff links, you’ve got big cuffs going on anyway. But after liking these a lot, the stem popped right off. I had to return them. I wish they were sturdier.<br />Update: after 5 months, the seller contacted me and asked me to change my review. I asked for a pair that wouldn't break, and they said they weren't confident they could provide that, so let me pick another item. I chose the hand-of-the-king styled cufflinks instead. I received them last night. They're really, really good looking. And, they broke the first time I put on the shirt, before I even stepped out of the closet. They broke the same way as the others, right where the post connects to the decorative piece. And, I'm no noob to wearing cufflinks. I wear cufflinks every weekday. They look good.... until they break."
2.0,Once inside the purse the sides kept collapsing in. If it had not been so flimsy it would have been great. It was the right size as advertised though.
2.0,"Its okay for a tank top - but its supposed to be &#34;Women's Dress&#34; - barely comes down to my stomach (I am not a tall person or anything, only way this is a dress is if its for a child and then the upper part would not fit correctly)"
2.0,very beautiful and well made however too tight on my 2 year old. Hoping to get a 3T but not for an additional $30!!
2.0,"I am not fond of this shirt. I purchased a small which is still large. I'm petite, 5'2&#34; 105lbs. The neck part is a bit stretched out and sags, it doesn't compliment my body at all. To top it off, the sleeves are two different lengths! I was also not expecting it to be what I think is polyester."
2.0,Didn’t like the shrinkage on length. It went from too long to too short after the first couple washings.
2.0,"Fabric is soft and holds up to washing, but the snaps are too far apart. My baby sticks his toes and feet out of the holes between snaps."
2.0,The side shields are blurred and you can’t see out of the peripheral.
2.0,Posts too short for thicker earlobes. The opals are gorgeous. Can’t wear for very long as they cause issues due to the short posts.
2.0,Given as a gift. Hardly no slouch. Is pretty though and warm. Picture is way deceiving.
2.0,"Didn't fit well, longer and looser than expected."
2.0,Large fits like medium and even with the right fit it wouldn't fall in the front like the picture. It's a pretty color just not the fit u would expect.
2.0,The mask is great but too tight im sure its an amazing mask for other people but i am a big boned individual. My palms are 4-1/2 inches wide. 1 inch thick. Watches do not fit on my wrists and i have yet to find a hat that fits my head properly. So with that being said you can see why im not a fan of the mask for me personally
2.0,"The picture showed many different cute options, including some D*sney characters and even a Harrypotter but we got a lot of random animals, food, and a ton of weird holiday ones. Guess I shouldn’t be surprised for the cost."
2.0,"Very cheap looking shoes, had to go back.  I should have known better about thin shiny vinyl."
2.0,One of customer's picture and review fooled me. It could probably look good to someone who is taller. I should have exchanged or returned mine but I decided to kept it anyways...
2.0,Useless. Plain readers would do better. Distorted on the sides. Sent back
2.0,Got this for the bf to wear at Ren Faire for vikings weekend but it's super small. Like he wears a 00 in women's sizes for costumes and it was way to small for him.
2.0,"I agree with the rest of the reviews, that said, I knew what I was getting when I decided to buy - I am a woman with long skinny fingers, and the fingers were still WAY too long.  It was quite comical how ridiculous they were.  Also, the webbing of the thumb did not go down enough to match my hand, so my actual thumb was well below where the placement of that finger was, adding to the ridiculousness.  And, the thumb was much wider than the other fingers.  All in all, you get what you pay for here, so just know that up front.  I can't complain since I did.  It's fine for one night for $5, but do NOT pay more than that, and don't get it if you're wanting to use it more than once."
2.0,"These run very small.  Daughter was wearing a 6, purchased a 7, and they were still too snug."
2.0,"It is adorable, BUT super flimsy.  My daughter will love it because it is Sanrio - me not so much and I am grateful I only bought it as a Christmas stocking stuffer."
2.0,"These tube bras run very small.  I ordered a large, which was way too small overall.  It was quite obvious when I held it, but I did proceed to try it on and then realized that it would be too painful to continue doing so."
2.0,"I ordered the size according to the size chart. I’m 5’7, 150 lbs. This is not a large, it feels like a small. My chest is so squished, it’s spilling out of the sides. Hate it."
2.0,"Pretty dress,  but top is WAY too big."
2.0,This top is a weird material.  It's kind of shiny and very stiff... it's going to take many washings and several beatings to soften it up
2.0,"Although this dress was cute when I first put it on, it only took two washes before the material started breaking down. After a about a month it looked really ratty and worn and I had to throw it away."
2.0,"The moment I took this out of the box, I had flashbacks to homecoming. It had boning and was exceptionally poofy. My best friend had a black tie wedding - I would have looked ridiculous if I had shown up in this. If you’re 17? It’s perfect. If you’re 34? Look elsewhere :)"
2.0,Believe in Jesus don't believe in a rabbit's for
2.0,"Ordered this in gray, size L.  I don't care for the fabric and the fit is way to slim to be a comfortable lounger.  Sorry I purchased it."
2.0,I was very disappointed with the sizing of this garment after carefully going 2 sizes up.  In US sizes I wear a Med to Large in a garment like this. Had to return it.
2.0,Cute but the little gems fell off quickly
2.0,Terrible for use on any field equipment or backpack. Poor mounting options.
2.0,The picture is better than what I received but for the price worth it
2.0,"Loved the look, fabric, and shirt! The pants crotch was WAY TO LONG and I’m 5’9” tall! Would have kept if crotch fit."
2.0,I wore these earrings for a week and it turned my ear green and the earring as well. These tarnish way to fast but they are pretty. Definitely not worth another purchase
2.0,"This shirt does NOT fit like the picture. I like a fitted shirt.  This is not it.  Did not care for the material either. Thick, but poor quality. Returned it."
2.0,"to short in the legs,"
2.0,Nice pin but to expensive
2.0,"I’m sad. Very pretty stone… the necklace chain, however, is quite cheap & “rough” feeling… not deserving of the stone. Too, the setting is 925, gold plated. I’d rather have paid more $$$ for a quality stone+chain; will be returning and keep shopping.  :-/"
2.0,"Item looked as described. Quality is POOR. The snap on the strap broke the first time my 8 year old tried it on. Was able to hot glue it back on. It was purchased as part of a Halloween costume. The fit was off and it was hard to keep eye holes aligned while wearing, not comfortable as a result."
2.0,The fabric is one that would slip. Wouldn’t stay put against my hair.
2.0,Looks cheap. Not sure if I will wear this
2.0,"Feathers keep poking/coming off the jacket. Material needs to be thicker and seam needs to be stitched tighter or double stitched to prevent this. Fits well but come on, who needs to have feathers constantly poking out of their jacket?"
2.0,It wasn't the best quality and it was way to small for me
2.0,"I have yet to find a compression sock that does not dig into my leg and cause a red indented line that causes itching and  takes days to dissipate. These socks were no different, so I am disappointed with them. I wont buy them again."
2.0,The threading came apart when I tried the dress for the first time..... Was very disappointing
2.0,"The fabric of the dress is beautiful as well as the painting. But the top of the dress and the vest are very small. The dress has very large peaks that hang on the sides, very different from the model I had bought."
2.0,The gems on the inside turned green after a couple weeks.
2.0,Hard n not molded tp feet correctly. Looks great
2.0,Very light weight and runs smaller than expected.
2.0,"Any clothing from Asia is peculiarly small across the Bust area. Armed with this knowledge I had purchased 2 sizes larger to No avail. Made of a thin non stretchable cotton. All in all, a most awkward fit! Had to return this item!"
2.0,I liked it but it was so huge I had to return
2.0,Looks like a $10 necklace
2.0,The pins were not attached to the watch so were easy to lose.  The colors were too masculine.
2.0,Hem came frayed.
2.0,"very small, not what i was expecting. would not have paid this 15 for the size it is. i thought it was the size of a normal lure."
2.0,Pretty but not the right size. Also looks like thicker material online than it really is.
2.0,I personally did not like these pullovers.  I workout 5 days a week and to get it to fit in one dimension caused the fit in others to either be too long or too tight.  I am 5'10 and 190 and in good shape... it's tight on my chest and shoulders and too long in the sleeves.
2.0,Fabric is cheap and uncomfortable
2.0,the quality is poor.  these are not polarized nor photochromatic.  I was unable to return these.  Please do not purchase these cheap suglasses.<br />Update:  the lens scratch easily.  I don't think they are photochromatic either.
2.0,"It looks like not bad, but I don't  fit this mask, it make my skin itch and I cannot put on it well."
2.0,I ordered these socks on three different occasions.  The last time I ordered them (XL) the socks were much smaller. The box and the stitching inside of socks say XL but there is no way. Sad because I really like the socks but if they don't fit they aren't worth the money.
2.0,"Paper thin dress. Print is nice, but very thin... it would be a better pajama. Definitely returning."
2.0,COLOR ARE NOT AS VIBRATE AS THEY SHOW ON SCREEN... WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE COLORS I GOT.  BUT FIT PERFECT.
2.0,"The fabric that these are made out of is terrible. My husband’s have “pills” all over them. He has only worn them a few times and after washing once in cold, they are even worse. I am very disappointed in them. On a good note, he says they are warm and comfortable. They just look really awful 😔"
2.0,I like but; it’s too small
2.0,"Bought this for my 11 year old daughter… thought it was a great deal but after the first wash, the fabric is already pilling (see photo). What a disappointment.<br /><br />While I like the strap adjustment in the front as a convenience factor, the plastic adjustment shows through thinner T-shirt’s."
2.0,"When I had ordered these and waited for them to arrive in the mail I thought they were going to be able to stand the test of shipment. boy I was wrong, they arrived and once I opened it one of the earrings was broken already, No Idea how but I was very displeased and basically just gave the good one away, why have one without the other, makes hiding my elven ear seams hard. Not going to buy this again thats for sure....."
2.0,Love the socks but took way to long to receive.
2.0,I am giving 2 stars only because it does not fit!! it's very small and very hard to meet the ends together. they don't have to option of different sizes either.
2.0,Used this on about 8 of my players. Went o. Easy and looked good but on the last player the whole end piece broke off leaving it as pretty much one time use for me. The “stick” part is quite skinny
2.0,"like to dress up on Halloween when I pass candy out to the kids.  Usually, I dress as some scary char, but this year I decided to do something different.  This year I wanted a costume that wouldn’t frighten the littler kids but at the same time I might be able to use at some point besides Halloween.  I looked a bit and came across this….what better character to portray than the Grinch.<br /><br />My costume arrived and inside the bag it looked quite ‘Grinch-y’.  The green of the body of the suit was definitely the same as the Grinch wore on TV and in the movie.  The Santa jacket was a great shade of red with nice white trim.  And there were 3 Santa hats included…an early Christmas present?  Maybe. There was also a belt…a kind of cheap piece of vinyl…a set of Grinch gloves and a mask.  It seemed like everything I needed to get ‘all Grinched out’.<br /><br />I had ordered the costume in an XL because I’m tall and didn’t want it too short.  The green Grinch pant fit me fine.  I’m normally only a large, but they were actually a bit snug…so go bigger.  But they were long enough.<br /><br />The Santa jacket was also small…quite small actually.  It felt more like a medium.  And the belt did fit….tightly on the first notch.  There’s a lot of room on it to add more holes.<br /><br />I was happy up until that point with my costume until I opened the mask.  The latex/chemical of the mask was literally enough to knock you over.  I honestly didn’t think I would be able to wear it without getting sick.  I even let it sit out overnight in the garage to air it out…it still smelled.<br /><br />But the worst part of the mask were the holes for the eyes.  Not only were they very small, they were totally incorrectly positioned.  Whatever way I adjusted the mask, I could not see out of it.  From the outside, the eye holes look good….they just not usable at all.  I had to make new ones.<br /><br />The included gloves are another story.  The workmanship on those was absolutely horrible.  The fingers on one hand were mis-sewn, and there were holes in both of them as you can see in the pictures.  It was very disappointing.<br /><br />I did wear my Grinch costume on Halloween wishing all my trick-or-treaters a Merry Christmas.  But I only had it on for about an hour…I started to itch in it after that.  And I did notice myself ‘molting’ in the process.  Not good.<br /><br />Well. It’s a nice looking costume for the most part, but the quality not there.  Back to the designing board I guess."
2.0,"The sleeves are not as long as it was portrayed to be. The blouse is very thin and flimsy. I was not expecting that because the picture makes it out to be very thick. I usually buy smalls in shirt because of my petite body frame, but this blouse made me feel like I should have sized up."
2.0,"The bag is nice enough, but the silver-grey color is actually more gold or taupe.  The long strap is cheap looking with a fabric backing on one side. I needed silver, so the bag will be returned."
2.0,Super cheap. Comes loose as you wear it and fell apart within a month.
2.0,"The stitching on one of the cubes is coming out before they were ever used.  Since it was an inexpensive purchase, it's not worth going through the return process.  They are a lesser quality than Ebags and Amazon Basics (I own sets of both brands).  I would not buy again.  I guess you get what you pay for!"
2.0,"Kinda small, even for kids.  Stitching around elastic have out on first wear on 2 of the 6."
2.0,"Definitely not the prettiest. I didn't expect the sides to stick up when I put it around my wrist. It probably won't last long because I see it getting caught and snagging. It's been hard to find replacement bands lately, but this one is definitely not for a smaller wearable."
2.0,One of the diamonds fell out in a week of wearing it
2.0,"When compared  to the original Champion Powerback, the straps are thin and non supportive."
2.0,"If you have breasts, forget it.  Plus, the top runs VERY small.  I ordered an XL and it fits ok, however, I am an USA size 6/8.  Hardly an XL.  This is an ASIAN XL.  Also, this top is VERY sheer.  You will NOT be able to go to work without wearing a camisole underneath.  Factor that into the fit as well.  I don't know why designers continue to make sheer tops like this for women.  It's insane.  Are we really supposed to walk around with SHEER tops?!!  Crazy.  Only flat chested and very skinny women are going to like this top."
2.0,Another cheap uncomfortable mask. Had to take it off after 5 minutes. I couldnt stand it any more.
2.0,They are ok it depends what you like I won’t buy them again a little big for me
2.0,Bracelet fell off my wrist.😞<br />Loved it
2.0,this item is cute but when u go outside the wind blows through the holes making u feel cold !
2.0,Broken nose piece 💔 never used it kept falling off
2.0,Extremely stiff leather not comfortable
2.0,"The sweater I received had loose threadings. it wouldn't have bothered me if it wasn't on the front of the sweater, even at the V neck part, where everyone would notice. I purchased this for work, and it looks very poor quality, so I had to return it. I had high hopes for it, but I might have to look elsewhere."
2.0,"VERY small, bottoms fit well but the top was so small that it didn't cover ANYTHING."
2.0,I ordered a size up because I have wide feet and the sole is still way too small. The part that goes around the ankle is also very tight.
2.0,"It's ok. I usually wear a Small but ordered Medium based on other reviews. It's the right size but it fits funny. The sleeves sit right on the edge of my shoulders and they feel like they're going to fall off. It pulls strangely across the chest too. I haven't worn it for an entire day yet because every time I put it on, it just feels weird."
2.0,Can open the black set of gauges. Pretty bummed
2.0,Gave this shirt to my daughter. :(
2.0,It doesn’t stay sticky. Within an hour it started coming off at the corners and I’m only a 32C. Also the shoe string like pull thing shows through most everything I would want to use this for.
2.0,"Looks a bit cheap, but very easy to put in. Unfortunately the bar is short and it didn't exactly fit. My nipples are about the size of a dime and the wings were digging into the sides. Super fast shipping!!"
2.0,Belt is way too stiff...
2.0,Otherwise it was beautiful.
2.0,It’s a really cute belt but it’s very small and the strap broke while I was trying to tie it :(<br />Definitely designed for a more petite body type
2.0,"very narrow, good women’s sunglasses but not good for men... pinches your temples and causes headache."
2.0,Top sticks up too high.  Not a beach hat.  Better for boating or whatever.
2.0,"I got this watch on the last day of november.<br /><br />The body itself seems sturdy, but the inside decorations look pretty cheap. The same goes for the band, it started cracking pretty soon. My wrist has a circumference of 7 inches, the band fit well, with room to spare.<br /><br />I noticed while trying to wind it that it didn't work like other watches where you leave the pin down to wind, and lift it to adjust the time. Instead, I lifted the pin to adjust the time and it also wound the mechanism. Turning the pin in the down position did make that faint clicking &#34;winding sound&#34; but ultimately did absolutely nothing. This seemed like a failure in the manufacturing process rather than intentional, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />The hands are pretty difficult to distinguish from the background. It's ok to tell the time in daylight, but in a darker environment (or if you have poor eyesight) it's pretty much useless. It doesn't glow in the dark.<br /><br />The body of the watch is a half inch thick, which is quite substantial, so be advised.<br /><br />It kept time perfectly during the day, but it wouldn't keep running through the night unless I gave it a few good shakes before I put it away (to activate the winding mechanism that responds to movement). I didn't mind having to set it to the right time whenever I wore it though, but if this is a problem for you, again, be advised.<br /><br />The band also started cracking pretty soon. I was actually considering getting a new band for it, but unfortunately the watch stopped working yesterday. I'm not sure what broke, but it won't even wind anymore. I didn't wear it every day, but I'd say I've worn it for about half of the time, so that would make it a month and a half (maybe two) of active usage.<br /><br />Because of this, I would definitely advise against buying this as a present for someone. Unless you want to disappoint them.<br /><br />In conclusion, you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Did not like the fabric of these. Makes them seem cheaper. If you don't have thigh complete thigh gap you will hear when you walk.  The fabric also becomes lighter due to stretch when you put them on which makes them more of a grey.  As a chick with a booty and thighs- not my cup of tea. I got small. 5'2"", 123."
2.0,"Wouldn't purchase again, neck has wrinkles, very cheap looking."
2.0,"Very Cute, but fits smaller than expected."
2.0,Nice hat but doesn't fit my head.
2.0,"This case has did my son until we could order a new one but he’s scared of dropping it because there really isn’t much protection for the phone, it’s a very flimsy case"
2.0,"The size is good. It would be great to carry a tablet or small laptop. I don’t have the need for that. I didn’t like the strap, It is thick and slick surface makes it hard to keep on your shoulder. Over all it’s ok but just not for me."
2.0,I like these earrings but the picture of the earrings does not show in real size how little they are. I received them and I could hardly see the shapes of the earrings. The
2.0,The suit was too short waisted for me.
2.0,Super small- XL probably fits a 12 year old girl
2.0,"Very very uncomfortable, thick stitching (too thick). If not careful when using it - it may hurt or bother the area between your ring and pinky finger..as the stitching seams to be heat sealed and has a sharpness to it.<br /><br />Great customer service however, willing to go the extra mile and have taken into consideration my issues.<br />- If you don't mind the style I did find flipping it inside out did help with comfort (still not for me) but that was better."
2.0,These are VERY VERY tiny and definitively not for an adult.
2.0,"I like wristlet straps, they're great, I have them on all my phone cases, keys, camera, etc.  HOWEVER, this particular set showing""RANDOM COLOR SELECTION"" is completely UNACCEPTABLE .  How would I know what colors are actually coming?  It doesn't seem difficult to say ""5 red, 5 orange, 5 yellow"", etc.  and ship that way.  I won't buy from this seller unless I know what I'm getting."
2.0,Not what I thought it was - too large
2.0,I liked that there were so many lens. There was a lot that came in the room case.  I didn't like the lack of instructions. I was unable to remove the lens and feared breaking them so I returned the item.
2.0,Color was very different then on-line picture.
2.0,"Built in light very poor, unable to see at night"
2.0,"Not 'slim fit' at all. Fits right in the shoulders and arms, but like a tent in the midsection. Very short too."
2.0,Most of them fell apart before I ever got them out of the package.
2.0,Material was way too skimpy
2.0,This dress has the potential to be pretty but it is just cut too small and way too short (for anyone above 5'7&#34;). It is not meant for anyone with a chest above a C cup. It's also super sheer and would need a slip.
2.0,This is a beautiful shirt but it fits very small
2.0,"These earrings are very large and look best on a larger face. The wood portion of the earring is nice and is the color represented on the product page. The gold portion is a thin gold painted metal and looks very, very cheap.<br /><br />On the plus side, the earrings are lightweight."
2.0,"The gloves are very small, I have average size hands, I ordered extra large and they were very tight"
2.0,There is one test I do for all of my leggings: The thumb test. I stick my thumb from the inside of the leggings to the outsuse - if I can see my thumb (skin) it is too thin for my butt.<br /><br />I gave it a second shot. I tried them on and bent my knees - very see through! I bent over to touch my toes - very see through on my butt! Can't do most gym workouts in these! You'll be very embarrassed!<br /><br />This does not have tummy control. It's waist band is significantly thicker so it causes an indent in you skin vs the rest of the leggings. If you have a tummy it will give you a roll over.<br /><br />They are a thick durable material but the knit is so large it splits to see your skin underneath! And it has that silky sheen/gloss to the fabric that I personally don't find attractive so I wouldbt wear just for a day running errands.<br /><br />One plus is that they are comfortable. They don't squeeze anything too much and they are also true to size.
2.0,Not so good way too big for the wrist
2.0,Not really compression socks
2.0,The shirt is adorable but it runs a tad small.
2.0,"This is a beautiful t shirt but it runs EXTREMELY small....the reason for the 2 star review. It took a very long time to receive it... not to mention that I purchased a XXL and received what I would call a size S or M, at best, at any store in the USA. It's too bad.....it is a very pretty shirt. I ended up giving it to my 10 year old niece"
2.0,"It's a nice tie, but we received storm troopers instead of Darth...😔"
2.0,I love the dress just not the color. Its a  mustard yellow like color. dress runs big go down a size. Overall its still cute.
2.0,"The sleeves  were too small, not proportional to the rest of the garment.  Did like the look but had to alter the sleeves"
2.0,Hats were too big. They were much too large for my wife and myself. I had to send them back. The dimensions for each hat should be specified.
2.0,"To thin, my daughter liked it I gave it her,I'm looking for one that is thick."
2.0,very difficult to use.  Not sure if all of those offered that look the same are similar.
2.0,Does not compliment my shape because of the way it’s made like a box. It was too big around the waist area so when I put the belt on it bunched you in the back.
2.0,"Really disappointed with these, the metal threads inside each opal are slightly off center and do not screw on flush with the posts and as a result aren't very secure. I've only worn them for ~4 days and the opal has already unscrewed itself somehow during a nap and become lost.  Sad, seeing as I wasn't able to find nice opal studs elsewhere."
2.0,"Biggest dislike was the polka dots. I really liked them on the model, but when I actually got the dress the polka dots were much bigger than expected and nothing like the cute little dots on the pictured model. Also was not expecting the dress to be a high-low. Again it was different than the actual picture."
2.0,Not that impressed. Seemed like they were on backwards with front higher than back. My butt still hurt after riding.
2.0,"Ugh. Product photos are inaccurate. I ordered green and received sky blue. The cardigan is not slouchy but is oversized. The fabric is not super soft. The cuffs are regular, the sleeves are regular, and the crochet is in patterned rows unlike the asymmetrical look of the photos. Not a fan of ordering a $39 sweater and receiving a knock off."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:b52c9621bcf74f6f3091e592055e06d5]] They're comfortable shoes and I'm a keep them cuz their house shoes but they're the wrong color
2.0,Fell off back of head a few time.
2.0,"Absolutely adorable. Great fit, unique style. LOTS of compliments.<br />CHEAP FABRIC. I will wear this a lot, but I would gladly pay double the cost for a 100% cotton seersucker or something like that. This fabric feels like cheap tablecloth fabric . Easy fix recommmdarion for the company."
2.0,"Order a large, the large size is really a medium."
2.0,"I bought these for my aunt who is an average sized little old 83 year old lady.  She couldn't get them on, she  plans to give them to her tiny great grand daughter."
2.0,"Sizes,was way off. Runs small"
2.0,"They seemed like they were great quality, but way too small for expected size unfortunately."
2.0,Not made for someone with thick thighs. Good leg warmers. The tie strings are cheaply made though.
2.0,"Beautiful earrings, but my daughters ears are too sensitive to wear."
2.0,"Super itchy fabric, really thin and I can't get rid of the static. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"I got these for a gift but they were super cheap looking when they came in.  Too late to send them back it's a stocking stuffer for Christmas, but the white on the lettering and egg is so crappy that I can see the black shirt through it.  It's not a good quality print.  Really bummed!"
2.0,"Ok glasses, but description says “2pack”....... only received one pair."
2.0,"I got two of these and I will be returning them because they didn't look like they did in the picture. They are really long beanies so the end sticks up an awkward way. I never tried the actual Bluetooth part out though, so I have no comment on that."
2.0,"Disappointed didn't fit too small and I am 5 9 and 195 pounds ,bought large and too tight!"
2.0,I ordered this dress in yellow. The color I received is orange. Not a pretty orange either. The inside lining is a yellow that I expected—I saw picture of another reviewer who got the correct yellow. The fit and cut are cute. Bummer.
2.0,Shorts are extremely large they feel like oversized basketball shorts. the back pocket can fit your phone however due to the oversized width it is impossible to use.
2.0,"As a &#34;larger&#34; guy with big thighs, these pants did not work out for me. They were large enough in the thighs for me to get them on and wear them comfortably walking around, but when I laid on the couch the pants were too tight when I started bending my legs. Had to return them. I know many people complained about the feel of the fabric. The fabric is not a soft cotton, it almost feels starchy, which personally I prefer that style fabric which added to the disappointment when I had to return them."
2.0,"Poor quality. This soaks up water and the thing that bothered me most about it was once I washed it the stuffing shifted around and balled up inside the jacket. I tried moving it back, but there is no way to fix it. You'll have places in the jacket that have no stuffing."
2.0,"I like that the gloves are cut resistant, but the grip material has peeled off within  one week of using them. In the pass the grip material held up a lot longer. Manufacturers must be cutting corners. NOT GETTING WHAT I PAY FOR. Better pair of gloves can be purchased at home depot."
2.0,"I know the description says XL, but I was not expecting them to be so big. I feel like a fly with big old eyes when I'm wearing these. Also if you have a small nose or other small facial features like I do I would not buy these because they are very front-heavy and constantly slip halfway down my nose. Don't get me wrong, they're stylish, but far bigger and over the top than I thought they'd be."
2.0,I ordered 3xl because I wanted them to fit a bit loose. I couldn't even get them over my thighs. Not a 3xl. I'd say it's more likely a medium so I'm giving them to my little cousin. They are soft and really light so I gave it 2 stars for that.
2.0,"This one I wanted to like.  But there was just too much extra fabric in the mid section.  Another dislike was that the print on the top was completely different from the one on the picture, did not appreciate that."
2.0,Chain broke after 1st time wearing. Same thing happen with others I bought in different colors. I had bought several for a trip.
2.0,Cheap but cute. Tie lace not long enough. We sent back.
2.0,"I ordered this based on the picture.  I thought it was two mats.  My girlfriend shared this link with me... She ordered the same one, same price, and recieved two mats in her order.  I recieved one."
2.0,"These are super low quality. Some of them are cute and possible to wear without them looking like I got them out of a quarter machine, but most aren't. Also, they're big on me and I'm a pretty average weight. They slip down to the base of my neck as opposed to sitting in the middle of my neck, and some of them were made incorrectly so the clamp is attached at the end of the long chain as opposed to the little circle on the opposite side where it is supposed to be!"
2.0,The material is nice and soft but it will not hold up. Any stress on the stitches is going to quickly rip the fabric. The cut of the shorts and inseam length is great.
2.0,Tiny. So small it barely fit my face.
2.0,"Very, very small.  Also, very thin material.  The photos do not adequately show how see thru the material is."
2.0,THEY ARRIVED WITH MOST COOKIES BROKEN AND ALOT OF CRUMBS !!
2.0,I have the rong fotlr a month and it is already turning brown.
2.0,"You get what you pay for - these are of exceptionally poor quality, the stuffing came out of one of the 'balls' with on a week, and fell right off a few days later. They're super cute ... but theyre junk."
2.0,The lens and the frame did not match up together on one side.
2.0,Seemingly higher quality for the price but after putting it on for 10mins; found the stitching is weak. The velcro’s Stitching was poorly done and came apart with little to no force.
2.0,"not great quality, and not the best cut, a bit too long too."
2.0,Bought this specifically for the night glasses. Turns out its completely useless. Day glass is good if your ok with blind spots while driving
2.0,Jeans were cute but no stretch at all. I originally ordered an xl and they were A little too small so I sent them back for a 2x and they fit the exact same. I want to try for a 3x but I’ll be upset if they fit the same.
2.0,"Really liked this dress in theory, very flattering on.  However it was NOT 95% cotton as listed in the description....much higher % of polyester.  Also, I am a standard XL, 40DD and the bodice was extremely tight and unflattering both front and back.  Disappointing so I returned it.  Larger busted women, I suggest you order a size larger and those who are looking for mostly cotton, look elsewhere."
2.0,"Band watch is pretty good, tool to remove links got broken in first try, I needed to pay to adjust it properly"
2.0,The length overall was very short (above my knees) the sleeves are only 3/4 length on me and I can barely close the robe around me.
2.0,"The print on this top was lovely, hence the 2 stars. However, this top runs extremely HUGE. I thought it would be a lose fit, but I'm swimming in it. I am normally a size M, 36D bust and 29/30 inch waist. It is also poor quality, the stitching on the shoulder came undone after one wash. I wouldn't recommend this top."
2.0,"This was just a silly Christmas Present I bought for my husband.<br />Sadly, upon opening the package, there was a hole in the middle of the dickie.<br /><br />I"
2.0,Fit was perfect until it got washed and dried. Shrunk 2 sizes. Beware!
2.0,"there was no size marked on the shirt anywhere but it was like a dress compared to other ""Youth Mediums"" he has.  Too difficult to return and not available any longer anyway.  maybe he can frame it and hang it on the wall for 2 years until he grows into it"
2.0,Not the style I expected.
2.0,"These are cheeky which I like, but the cut in the front is weird and saggy.  Not a very flattering frontal view!"
2.0,Disappointing to say the least. String everywhere...falling apart. One mask missing ear strap.
2.0,They are see through...
2.0,If fit and was cute but arrive completely ripped and stained...not sure what to even say about it.
2.0,They slip off your heals  constantly.  But they feel great when they’re not slipping off .
2.0,"I ordered my usual size, too tight.  Returned."
2.0,hot as hell !  so thick like a robe
2.0,"The fit was ok, but the non-skid plastic on the foot of the sock seems very flimsy and covers a very small portion of the sock, so it isn't very skid-proof. Cute design, but not very functional. I returned the socks."
2.0,Poor quality. Very thin fabric. Rubbery graphics that will split and crack soon.<br />Bought for my grandson. Hope he tires of this shirt before it looks like a hand me down.
2.0,"Such a cute concept but, the material is like wearing spandex and it’s not very soft. I wear a medium and the large was skin tight! Size up twice y’all."
2.0,"Much smaller than expected,  definitely not a 35L bag.  It is as pictured- pockets and molle etc... but much smaller than described and doesn't ""feel sturdy"" if you understand. I'd have no issue at all using it lightly,  a couple books, odd and end every day things. But serious use... I'm not sure I'd roll with this pack for my needs"
2.0,"I would have given this a higher rating, but the hem line was terrible uneven. The length of cutout at the bottom of the dress was not made well and some places were longer than others which made the dress look cheap as if I had sewn it together myself."
2.0,The tag on the inside says 100% cotton but there's no way it's cotton. It's like swimsuit material and stretchy so it for sure has spandex in it. The plaid part feels like a stiff polyester. It's an odd material for baby clothes.
2.0,"These pants get coming down. The top was fine, but the bottom didn’t work. I gave this suit away."
2.0,Bracelet and clasp broke after only a couple days
2.0,"This hat is cute and it fits as expected; however, it had a huge flaw in the front under the brim.  There is no way to wear it where it won't show.  I'm disappointed that I have to go through the hassle of returning it.  I do have another one that is fine and I like it.  It was cheaper."
2.0,Theses watch straps could be a great replacement but the design of the straps cause issues with how the bands look on galaxy watch 4. There is a groove on the inner straps by the connector and since the silicone is softer than the original it causes a bent look instead of a smooth curve around wrist. Also due the silicone being softer it flips the angled part up instead of “pushing” towards the bezel to give the sleek look the original bands create. If they increased the hardness of the silicone to make the connector ends more rigid and got rid of the groove on inner strap these would make excellent replacements. But for now I’m returning and wouldn’t recommend theses straps. The third photo shows how the blue strap sits compared to original  yellow strap that came with watch.
2.0,Very unforgiving material and transparent. I got it in light purple and it’s pretty much see through. But more than that the material is so light and every single bump eg cellulite shines through. You’re going to need a slip.<br /><br />The upside the glitter doesn’t fall off and it’s a relatively nice dress.
2.0,"This is a very pretty Christmas tree pin, but it is tiny.  It measures only about 1 1/4 inches long.  Dang, the size is right there in the description.<br /><br />If it were larger, at least 2&#34; long, it would have been a keeper."
2.0,Back of the shoe rubbed a sore on my son's heel. He was crying everytime he took a step. Now he can only wear these with long socks. Also they didn't hold up very well to an active 4yo. The rubber started coming apart from the fabric in a couple weeks and then the fabric started to tear. I think I would have been better off just buying him walmart shoes.
2.0,Picture misleading. Looks like you get two belts
2.0,This was the only pair of Nurse Mates compression socks that actually came up to my knees. The rest fit like crew socks and drove me crazy! I still had to pull this pair up several times over the course of a 12 hour nursing shift and that is unacceptable. I need an effective sock that performs like it should.
2.0,Hole in the pocket and the color isn’t bright like the photo. Looks washed out
2.0,I’m 6ft y’all so professional clothes are hard to shop for. This is 1. See through 2. The length on the arms is too short for me 3. The fit on the shoulders and boobs on my tall frame just is not right (very wide shoulders so it looks like an upside down bag on me.
2.0,This band does not appear to be the bright color listed and does not appear to be going to hold up with daily wear.<br />I am not happy with this purchase for the money.
2.0,"I bought the watch for the back lighting. It barely lights up and I cannot see the time in the dark. Otherwise, the watch is pretty and comfortable."
2.0,"This product was described as an ""adult hat"". It was not an adult hat, it barely fit a child. Would NEVER buy again. Very disappointed."
2.0,"If I'm going to wear shoulder pads, I would like to notice broader shoulders.  This might be great for a very petite woman.  I would prefer a larger one.  I also lost one the first day I wore it.  Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Fits oversized like advertised but the holes look like they were perfectly hooked punched and doesn’t look right for some reason. Also the material is not cotton like i thought it’s very weird material
2.0,"Not delicate like the image shows. Fits funny, looks more like a nightgown than a pretty dress. I returned it"
2.0,It was made small and it is  thin.
2.0,"I like the look and feel of the duffel, however thete is saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. When I say that I am referring the outer pocket that has way too much fabric for the pocket, so much-needed so that if you zip it up it gets caught and it's really annoying to fix. After I pulled out the pockets it looked like the workers had forgotten to take my bag off the machine and left me with at least 15' of fabric. The Velcro handle began tearing off after two months and is being kept together by superglue. Luckily my grandma tied it off in a knot and now I have to spend another  $10-$20 to get it fixed. It looked nice, however I should've just spent an additional $5 to get a good bag, I mainly use this bag for work and don't even put it through much, so to have it fall apart after two months is a letdown."
2.0,"The neckline on this is frayed, which you cannot see from the photo. Looks like chew marks to me."
2.0,Awkward looking to me.  Not pleased.  Good item is you actually like the look.  Great price.
2.0,"I like this top. It is a bit long on my already long body and the color is more of a red color. However, overall I can see myself wearing this often, because it is comfy. So, if you have a short body this is not the sweater for you and if you truly want pink this is not the sweater for you. If you want something that feels like a towel and comfy this is the top for you."
2.0,"I must believe that there is a mis-communication from one continent to another. While I like this design (or I would not have purchased it), I was hoping for a true sweatshirt because in casual Austin, TX, that is what I wear for the entire winter,  practically. But I have bought more clothing from other sources overseas that was billed  a ""sweatshirt"" only to find that they are made from flimsy material. So also with this shirt. It is not  sweatshirt material at all, but thinnish polyester-like material.  I fully believe the mis-labeling is not on purpose, though. But be aware."
2.0,The wash instructions were not what I would expect for pj’s. The top says “hang dry only” and the pants say “professional wash only dry clean”. WHO DRY CLEANS PAJAMAS!!!<br /><br />This may be why all of the comments say that the pants fade quickly since they are not actually able to be washed. So disappointing.
2.0,Cheap looking. And too small. From a distance to say maybe 6 feet you can’t even tell what it is. 2 stars are for the fact that there’s a key ring on it.
2.0,Don't know of my head was just big but they cracked the moment I put them on. Kind of a bummer but I did get a deal on Vipon for this product so I'm not hurting over it.
2.0,"I love the shirt, but there was a spider in it that bit me 5 times."
2.0,Picture is decieving
2.0,"Very cheap quality,"
2.0,Cheap and shabbily made.
2.0,Kept them but not really happy
2.0,Too small for us.  Will give away.
2.0,My daughter is 1 years old about 23 pounds and the 3t size fits here
2.0,Smaller then I hoped for and image not clear
2.0,"Color wrong not a true red, more orange/red need to remove symbols"
2.0,I wanted a crop top t-shirt pack that comes to the belly button these come above the belly button and go right below your boobs their belly shirts. Maybe if you're smaller chested it won't come up so high my sports bras are visible the shirts are so short.  I'm a 32 DD.  I was pretty disappointed.  It fits my shoulders it fits my chest it's just too short you can see the bottom of my sports bra.
2.0,This jumpsuit looked great on the  site. Unfortunately it was ripped at the center seam in the front when it arrived so I will be  returning it. Other reviews are correct it is completely see through so wouldn't recommend wearing bra/underwear with it. Overall was poor quality.  Save your money.
2.0,They were pretty much cheaply made. I was disappointed.  Won't buy those again. Sad thing... I bought 2
2.0,Didn't fit me very well. Looked awful on me. Gave it to my mother and she seems to like it.
2.0,It's a big square so hard to wrap around your neck cute. Not maroon more of a pinky red with a bright yellow
2.0,Smaller than I expected.  Will return.
2.0,It's not cotton.
2.0,I wanted a mask that I could wear to the gym and breathe with ease but this mask is just way too big. It felt more like wearing a backwards hoodie than it did a mask.
2.0,Broken with normal gentle wear. The leather appears to have been weak near the clasp and broke after a short time of normal gentle use.
2.0,"Fit too large, and a whole patch of sequins was missing. Looked terrible. Returning it."
2.0,"It look beautiful my granddaughter liked it, but it was to large. She got an allergic reaction. I don’t recommend it."
2.0,Muy lindo pero pequeño
2.0,"This bralette fit me well around the band, the material was nice and breatheable and I like that the straps are adjustable, but this was made for someone with almost no breasts. Incredibly annoying because you’d think as the sizes went up there would also be more room in the cups, but that could not be further from the truth. I am about a 36C. In my opinion this bralette is sized for someone who is a 36A or 36AA. I think it would fit an average-built man better than it would fit most women."
2.0,"Cute skirt, but I ordered a medium, because that’s my normal size. But the even that medium was TOO large and TOO long. Kinda upset because I thought it would fit."
2.0,There was no flowers on this outfit at all it's just a bunch of colorful rings I had planned to wear this for Easter now I got to find something else this is considered false advertisement cuz it does not look like the picture I want my money back
2.0,Cheap junk -- you get what you pay for.
2.0,Major shrinkage!
2.0,"Color is not exactly as advertised. The purple is more of a pink, which is very disappointing. The fabric band is not very high quality and is a pain to get on."
2.0,It broke the first day not very good quality but its cool ig
2.0,"Well I purchased my band last year on july 17th. This morning putting it on I see the underside is cracking in multiple places on the leather part at almost all of the holes. This is a comfortable and nice band while it lasts. I have alot of allergies and it was hard to find a band that fits my watch that does not contain materials I am allergic too. Oh well. $20 for a band that only lasts barely a year is not good. I am very careful of the band and it really only got wet when it rained or a couple of times washing my hands, and I do not putt it really tight, so the cracking on the underside is only explainable by the use of poor materials.  If you want something that lasts longer than 11 months buy another band."
2.0,"They are very loose overall and poorly constructed. The top seam on one was also super tight around calf and dug in, while the other was the opposite. They basically just end up around your ankles."
2.0,I ordered these leggings in gray and loved them so much I ordered some more in black.  The black ones fit smaller and the fabric was thinner.  Turns out there was a different manufacturer.  Viv agreed to exchange the ones I received with leggings made by the same manufacturer as my gray ones that fit so well.
2.0,Zipper broke after only a few uses...waste of money
2.0,"I wish it were a bit longer since when I’d lift my arms, my stomach would show. And don’t buy this unless you expect to wear a shirt under since the material is quite thin and slightly see through"
2.0,"The quality is ok, ordered a large to make some room for shrinkage from washing but right out of the package was too short/ tight.  I usually wear a medium."
2.0,"Recommend buying a smaller size, they run large!! Because they come fromChina I figured they would run sm… well guessed wrong they run big… a little see through, I will wear them around the house only…. Would not recommend buying … wear a XL, bought 2Xl shoul have bought a large"
2.0,This was supposed to be a potty watch for my grandson during the night.  It only vibrates slightly.  And the alarm is very soft.
2.0,"I bought this for my tall son with autism whom love the Pokémon character.unfortunately, it runs smaller than it’s listed size. Disappointed..sleeves are short. Seller hasn’t tried to reach out to rectify the issue."
2.0,The pin is bad
2.0,"I was so excited to get this jacket, and when finally arrived it was a total disappointment, literally just took it out the package to try on, and the pieces on the belt felt apart I couldn't believe it, plus it fits wear for me it made me look square, I guess it's made for very skinny girls I usually wear size small on jackets or size 2 so I thought M would fit me well but that wasn't the case. The quality of the fabric it is no so good, the buttons are hallow not a solid piece, I was very with the quality"
2.0,"It was too small for a 2X. If you wear a L, I think the 2X would fit nicely. It was a cut print and seemed like it would be flowy on the right person."
2.0,I got a size XL even though I wear a 8 sometimes a 10.  It was too small in the body but too big under the arms.  I think if you are a tiny short waisted big boobed girl it would fit perfect.  But for me not at all.  It looks great on the model.  I think it was Asian sizing.  I should know better by now.  I had cut the tags off to try it on so will not be sending it back.
2.0,Fabric is nice and pattern/colors were beautiful. The dress was extremely too short. I did not even reach my ancles and I’m only 5’7”. Returning it and bummed it didn’t work.
2.0,Lo ordene New born y parece de 6 meses
2.0,Snap part doesn’t stay together. Popped off many times during his party
2.0,"Fits well and is the style depicted. However, the color is not what I expected; kind of orange-brown. And the hood and yolk are reddish-orange rather than the brown pictured, and it does’t look as nice or natural."
2.0,U can't breathe no better then a regular mask
2.0,"I really liked the Robeez slipper- style shoes when my son was an infant, but when I tried these when he started to walk - I found them to be too narrow and tight for his chubby baby feet. They left a red mark around his ankle and were way too tight across his foot.<br /> It wasn't a size issue because there was plenty of room lengthwise."
2.0,The silver rubbed off to reveal copper after 7 days of wearing it.Take it off when you shower and sweat...and breathe. would NOT recommend
2.0,did not fit me well
2.0,We have bought this in black and grey! The white was not the best. We had to return it. My husband loves it for training outside and indoors.
2.0,"They are kinda nice. Way too small, sizing varies depending on color choice. I bought the pack of seven and every other underwear is slightly different in size, the black and dark blue are not shiny at all, also sizes do t matter i ordered both small and large and they are the same exact size. Zero difference"
2.0,These shirts are very cheaply made. I’m disappointed as the reviews were great. They seem to be tight in the front and open on the back. They are not very long as my skin will probably show when I raise my arms. The material isn’t all that comfortable either. I wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,"It was not as in the picture, blue is much darker (nearly black) and the xip quality is not of the best. I got that to give as a gift.<br />Have another bag from the same company and it is great."
2.0,"Cute romper, but it doesn’t stay together in the bust area, would absolutely have to pin it. Wouldn’t recommend to bustier ladies"
2.0,Had to return it cause it didn't fit the way i wanted to. found a better stretchier fit on walmart's website. Its not very stretchy either. Wish they offered bigger sizes
2.0,okay so these shoes are good— but what in the heck are they doing with these weird see through straps? i can see where their idea was going but it’s not very practical. good shoes but you’re gunna have to get creative to get the back straps to actually be up. otherwise they’re just awkward flip flops
2.0,Unusually small for the size
2.0,"Size was as expected, but it doesn't flow all nice like the picture depicts."
2.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 150lbs. I ordered a large and found that the bottoms were too small. Fabric is cheap and see-through."
2.0,dont like it much
2.0,Love the bracelet but the buddah piece fell off the bracelet within a week...
2.0,Broke with normal usage within about 2 months
2.0,"too small, gave them to my wife."
2.0,Very small for size it’s supposed to be
2.0,"Only lasted about 5hrs, got very hot wearing it. Too small. Which the bluetooth wasnt noticable."
2.0,Needs to be steamed out of the package. Feathers are everywhere. Limited times to wear before it completely sheds everywhere.
2.0,"I wanted to use these items for work, but it fits uncomfortable and the sleeves are way too short. I will be returning. I bought a medium"
2.0,"The hat has a weird shape to it that wasn't clearly identifiable prior to ordering the hat. Had I seen it, this wouldn't have been ordered."
2.0,Didn’t like the material. Look and felt cheap
2.0,I so wanted to love these but the top was too long and the shorts waistband way too tight. Also material was seer but I imagine if you got a darker color would be fine. I’m 5’2 125lbs. I ended up returning this product.
2.0,metal piece cut my nose
2.0,Castle part of picture is really small.  Sky is dominant.  Would not recommend for bracelet because of picture size.
2.0,Really thin  material which makes it see-through And also if by any means you have a couple of  cellulite they will show too. Also no label to  indicate the size of the product.
2.0,"Good, kinda expensive thou. I wish could have more than 1."
2.0,The arms are not a navy blue. They are royal blue and I don’t like it as well. Wouldn’t have ordered it had I known. I’ll be returning it ASAP.
2.0,Way too small (but good buying experience.
2.0,"These feel wonderful; however, I am getting blisters breaking them in 😤"
2.0,belt loops too high
2.0,I ordered an X-Large based on the website recommendation.  I was not a fan of the fit or the material.  These are not like spandex if that’s what you’re looking for. They looked large and unshapely on me.  I ended up giving them to my daughter as Amazon returns are such a hassle.
2.0,Doesn't fit like it looks in picture the back is shorter.
2.0,"Usually wear medium, this medium was like 3 times my size"
2.0,Was tight and too small.
2.0,"I'm very petite and small, just a little over 5ft and I can still fit into junior small sized clothing! This was difficult to put on!"
2.0,"The items were ok.  They arrived with the shipping container bone dry and yet 2 masks were very wet and smelled of mildew.  I soaked them for many hours trying to get the smell out.  The product itself was ok, not as stretchy as other gator masks I have tried, which makes it difficult to get over the head.  I would not buy these again."
2.0,Too small. the sizing does not correspond to the actual size.
2.0,Broke way too easily
2.0,"The product photo is clearly a photoshop job, so I didn't have the greatest of expectations, but hope springs eternal.  The logo is very small on the face of the hat and the formed area on the front of the hat is enormous.  The hat looks absolutely stupid on my head (I have a small-ish, heart-shaped face) unless I wear it backwards, which, I mean, I dress like I'm in Avril Lavigne's music video for ""Complicated"" despite it being 2020.  Even wearing it that way, the massive form of the front causes the hat to look oversized -- and it does, in fact, press down on my ears, which admittedly do stick out a bit (I blame my Irish great-grandma).<br /><br />I'm not sure if the emblem looking so small is because, again, the front is massive, or because it admittedly is just the Z from the Breath of the Wild take on the Zelda logo.  The actual construction is fine and I like the black-and-white Hylian Crest pattern on the hat's inside.  It is 85%/15% acrylic/wool, so it's very solid feeling.<br /><br />I'm someone who goes by Z with all my friends (I spell it Zee if I have to write it at work), and I have the Crest of Hyrule tattooed on my calf, so this seemed perfect for me, but here we are.  I was very close to returning it, but the Z logo itself is cool, and it is kind of fun to be stealth-wearing my name AND one of my all-time favorite franchises.  Lesson learned, next time I go with Bioworld, I guess (they make the licensed hats found in Gamestop and Hot Topic)."
2.0,"These bras were simply too tight and were not a good size or fit for me. If you are on the fence like I was, don’t buy it. If it would’ve fit though, I think it would’ve had nice coverage and gave a nice lift."
2.0,Super cute glasses...poor quality.
2.0,"It looked great, at first blush. I wore it at home to lounge around in and was pleased with it until I noticed that BOTH ARMS just under the arms not at the seems and not at the underarm [pit] area - had holes along both of the arms!?  I was so sickened by this I threw this item away! Do not purchase this. looked good till someone points out that your brand new sweater is torn."
2.0,"Normally I dont have an issue w 47 brand, but this hat came way too big compared to other 47 hats Ive gotten this size. Basically spent 30$ on a hat i cant wear!"
2.0,"I purchased the set with the pink, velvet leotard. The tutu and tiara were very poor quality. The tutu is very short and stiff. It arrived crumpled and messy. I got the set for around $6, but even at that bargain price I did not think it was worth keeping."
2.0,"I ordered these for a chest piercing, way too small. The gauge was correct but the hoops themselves were way too small for where I wanted to put them. These would be great for an eyebrow or septum, just not nipple piercings."
2.0,"Pros:  -They are cheep.<br />  - Comfortable enough<br />Cons:  -They smudge really easily,<br />  - One is scratched slightly and one came with a dent, not to bad, but noticeable.<br />  - Not very reflective.<br /><br />I received these fast with prime, they came in a plastic bubble wrap bag, individually wrapped in ziplock bags. They had a shiny paper tag on each pair reading &#34;Airforce&#34; or something like that, a sticker on the left lens reading &#34;Original classics - Uv 400&#34; and one reading Something else on the other lens."
2.0,I guess the Chinese are just really small.
2.0,Medium sweater fits like an extra large. It might be good if it didn't make me look like a gray parachute.
2.0,"As with another reviewer; they are too narrow, especially in the arch. I even ordered a half size larger. Maybe a full size larger may have worked better!"
2.0,"Incredibly soft fiber, and nice fit.  The crotch area however, is the same fabric, and it will not old the adhesive on panty liners which I always use. IT's been proven the crotch area needs circulation and cotton has always been recommended.  I passed the panties along to a friend. Would seriously like to know why the designers didn't account for the use of pads and liners - a necessity for women - in these hipsters.  Going to always look for crotch fabric from now on.  sigh."
2.0,WIERD....GAVE IT AWAY!!
2.0,"I really wanted to love these slippers, but I am pretty disappointed. The upper part of the slipper is sooo thin and feels very cheap. I took them out of the packaging and they were all smushed and disfigured. Not what I was expecting. And they've already started shedding after 5 mins. Will buy LLBean or something higher end next time. Don't waste your money."
2.0,Haven’t even worn it yet because it looks so cheap. strings sticking out everywhere. I can’t even roll the sleeves up like I was planning because all the seams and edges look awful
2.0,It is short and wide and not very flattering at all.
2.0,"Stitching came out first day, didn't even make it threw dinner...good joke gift tho I suppose?!?!"
2.0,Fabric was much too warm for my climate....heavy knit fabric.  I liked the look just not the fabric
2.0,"This blouse arrived very wrinkled, I didn't expect to have to iron this blouse I don't have time. Therefore i returned it for something else."
2.0,Runs about 2 sizes smaller than usual.
2.0,Did not like this short it was big and the material was ugly and it did not really look like the picture. It looks more like a girl shirt
2.0,"Well, for the first week they were awesome. Worked like they are supposed to. Then the stitching blew on one side and now the slack runs through the buckle. Then a few of the clips stopped holding firm. I find myself in the bathroom 3x a day reattaching clips. I hope B&P figures it out, bc it's a good concept, just not realistic as of now."
2.0,It was cute but way too big. Order a size down (not something I’ve ever recommended before). I’m also petite so the straps wouldn’t stay on and I had to return it. If I went 2 sizes smaller it might have worked. It definitely covered my stomach nicely though.
2.0,Way too small. Order up
2.0,Got this a couple days before Halloween only find out the crown doesn't work. My 7 year old was pretty upset. Good thing we had a backup costume.
2.0,Comes from China is way too small.
2.0,Too tight and sizing seems smaller then normal.
2.0,I don't like this dress
2.0,I feel that the size isn’t that accurate. It’s too loose for my kid. It’s comfortable to wear though.
2.0,"Looks ok, but feels cheap and poorly made. The glie alreday sems to be coming apart a little. Not impressed at all."
2.0,Very small. Made in china.
2.0,"Cute, but to big for my taste"
2.0,"I purchased a black pair and a blue indigo pair both in extra small.  For some reason the black pair is much, much smaller than the blue pair.  The blue pair fits great, but I could barely get the black pair on.  I will be sending it back."
2.0,"Thought they'd be ok, but I should have paid attention to the other reviews better.  The lenses are basically just painted with silver paint and are really hard to see through even in bright sunlight.  Take these to the desert."
2.0,Smaller than thy appear on website
2.0,It DONT LOOK LIKE ROSE GOLD it looks like COPPER
2.0,"I've purchased third-party nylon straps for my Garmin before. They made the velcro on the wrong side for one end of the strap. If the velcro on one end is on the opposite side as the other end, you can clasp the back without interference from the other side of the strap. Being that it is designed this way, the straps close on top of each other on the back of the wrist. And I am a decent size adult male. The situation would be worse if you had smaller wrists.<br /><br />Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the ends of the band are going to be subject to fraying since they are not held together by a plastic piece like other similar third-party options. If you actually wear your $600 - $1000 Garmin outside, this will be a particular issue.<br /><br />Overall, it just feels cheap and janky. For $10 per band (no option to buy 1 either), sure it's less expensive than a band straight from Garmin, but maybe it's worth a few extra bucks to have a decent band on a premium device. I wouldn't recommend this."
2.0,"Not impressed at all. The stitching and the whole layout is wrong, it is also expensive. But it fits. The price and the product don't match."
2.0,"It seems like a nice shirt, but since other people said it ran small I ordered two sizes above my regular size and it's still too tight to wear."
2.0,"The lining of this dress is shorter than the dress (mid-thigh vs. ankle-length), and not sewn on the side, so the lining is extremely obvious (through the slit) when you walk or sit down.<br /><br />Additionally, the fabric doesn't breathe well at all. Wore the dress in Greece & was miserably hot, just one day after wearing a FANTASTIC, breezy dress from the same brand. [[ASIN:B071ZPNYKQ Milumia Women's Boho Split Tie-Waist Vintage Print Maxi Dress (Medium, Orange-Red)]]"
2.0,Item came in silver not black and box was completely damaged. The only good thing is the watch was in working condition. Just not the color I wanted.
2.0,Doesn’t like to connect to your phone and crashes every time you update it. Half the time it doesn’t go off and the other half it doesn’t stop going off. It does a good job of quietly waking you up whenever it does decided to work. The charger it came with was cheap and stopped working after a few weeks.
2.0,"Arrived so wrinkled I would have to bring it to dry cleaners to press, IF it didn't run so small.  I had to return it anyway"
2.0,"Hugh quality fabric, but sizing was very large. I would need every component altered. I also had to pay $18 for return shipping, even though I followed return directions. This is not a vendor with shipping agreements. Buyer beware, you will not know this."
2.0,The ring fit but had very little &#34;Bling&#34;.  I would not suggest you buy this ring.
2.0,Is not good. Part.
2.0,"Too small when I first got it, 6' 190lb, ordered and xl.  A donation after first wash."
2.0,"This necklace is prettier in the photo.  The chain looks cheap, but I'm not complaining because the necklace was very inexpensive."
2.0,I am a size 12 and like things that are<br />Somewhat loose so I ordered an xl.  The elastic is very tight and uncomfortable.
2.0,"Earrings came in little plastic bags and are not at all clear and shiny, as pictured."
2.0,Me gusto el color pero me pareció demasiado rígido para mi Gusto.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this dress, but was very disappointed. The material was soft and the perfect thickness for coolness and comfortability and not being see through. However, the cut and poor styling leaves excessive gapping under the arms, and the neck is cut funny and the crossing pieces in the front do not lay properly."
2.0,"I've tried it on and fit well, snug.  Waiting for it to get colder to wear it outside.<br />Edited: TOO SMALL. I gave it to Goodwill"
2.0,"It is very light weight cotton fabric, would be ok for Hot weather, Just fits me even though I am Not big for my size"
2.0,worth about $8
2.0,If they weren't too heavy I would have given these 5stars
2.0,"Way to small,<br />Disappointed"
2.0,Really small for my taste but is cute if you want small studded earrings.
2.0,"The band is cute, but it takes no time at all to smell. If I was interested in cleaning it with baking power daily, I would wear it more often. I have stopped using it due to odor."
2.0,These are super cute and my 10 year old was excited to receive them. They are glass and the packaging was thin and provided minimal breakage protection (not Amazon's packaging; seller's packaging). 6-8 arrived broken. :/
2.0,"Very, very cheaply made. Bought for a gift but I was very embarrassed to give it. Sigh."
2.0,"I guess it's defective, as the emblem and print face the side nearest to the mouth piece instead of the opposite side furthest from the mouth piece. The material for the logo and print will eventually rub off from contact with hands, oils, lotions, and friction etc based on where it's placed. For this reason and the price I give it only 2 stars!!!"
2.0,As soon as I received them they were much thinner than I thought. As I tried one of them on it broke instantly.  Very poorly made.  flimsy. I returned them. Not worth the $.
2.0,Update 5/2/17 I wore these gloves through the winter on days it was too warm for Thinsulate lined gloves (not daily). I just discovered the hole between the left first and second fingers. I wrote to Lundorf expressing my concern that this is not an expected wear pattern. Their answer was for me to deal with Amazon because Amazon fulfilled the order. I am outside the 31 day return window and so have a pair of unusable gloves plus a pair of unworn grey ones for summer which may also be too fragile for actual use. I am not a happy camper As I expect companies to stand behind the quality of their products.  Also HiPo Steve's wife writing this message.<br />Nicest pair of gloves I have owned in decades.<br />HiPo Steve's wife writing this. I have been wearing them constantly for a week now. Great fit for my hands with long fingers and they cover the wrist. Nice leather. Excellent workmanship.<br />I ordered 4 pair in different colors. Kept the Black and Grey ones. Sent the Ivory and Petrol back. Would have kept the Petrol (gorgeous blue/green) but they were too small (boxed as size 8 but label inside glove was 7). I may reorder the Petrol.<br />Refund on returns was prompt.
2.0,"This was the 2nd time ordering these pants, 1st time they were perfect.  The 2 nd time they were too big and came branded. They were not the same pants at all."
2.0,"Odd fit, returned."
2.0,"I would've given this a few more stars, but mine came without pins or install tool. I don't really care about the install tool, but I would've appreciated the pins. Now I have to go find some, since my original ones broke.  Pain in the you know where.<br /><br />I am not sure if it was an omission (in reading reviews, it seems other customers received with pins and install tool) or if it comes with some bands sold by this seller and not others. But really, who sells a band with no pins?"
2.0,The description wasn't accurate at all
2.0,Material wasn’t what I expected.  Didn’t like how it feel on my legs.  And cheap made
2.0,"Doesn't look like the picture. Bottom is distressed, but since it doesn't match the top, it just looks ripped. Looks generic."
2.0,Its really pretty but if you have small wrists its going to be too big....I'm disappointed. If it was just a bit bigger it would be perfect.
2.0,"returned item, it was too loose on my wrist"
2.0,"While the style was cute and the length  was just right, it was way too big. Granted I'm 5' 2&#34; 115lbs but it looked like a plus sized cover up on me."
2.0,"Runs crazy small. It feels really good, and looks very nice, but order 2-3 sizes up. I'll be returning."
2.0,The backlight is not working properly and the strap feels like it will kink at the point where it fits my wrist.<br /><br />I really like the shape of the watch though; it has a very low profile.
2.0,Too large to wear and in the long run won't hold up
2.0,These earrings are not &#34;clip on&#34; as stated in the item title.  They have no clip at all.  They are stud earrings that arrived in a small padded envelope with the studs bent and no &#34;backs&#34;.  The design is nice but the person I purchased them for cannot wear them because her ears are not pierced.
2.0,Bought this after hours searching for bands big enough for my head and this was one of the two XL I found on amazon. Someone wrote a review that it fit their big head but guess mines bigger! 😂 Also very thin not sure if they’d have worked for winter jogs (trying to keep ears from frost bite in north winter weather).
2.0,JUST LOOKING AT THIS ITS OK HAVE NOT WORN IT YET
2.0,The green color is actually mint hue. The fit runs small. The fabric is a knit quality I would use for nightgowns. Returned it within the hour of receiving it.
2.0,The material is more like a polyester and scratchy. I prefer cotton or a cotton blend. Not stretchy material either.<br />If you have a pooch it sticks out.<br />Not a fan of these pants.
2.0,It was too short.  I can wear it as a sweater
2.0,I’m a 36b and this barely even covers my boobs. I got a refund for the product but they told me to keep it. Can’t even wear it around the house without severe under boob.
2.0,"I loved the look of this top, but I only wore it once and pulls, frays, and holes developed. I hadn’t even washed it. If you only want to wear it once, then go for it! Because it is super cute, but if you aren’t in to disposable clothing...keep looking."
2.0,They will not stay up after about an hour they fall down so thru out the day your pulling them up
2.0,I thought it was more thicker quality and heavier.  Looks nice but I will not purchase another one.
2.0,"originally i like these oants, thought they would be appropriate for work. One of the packets has only half a seam, so it's half a pocket. and after 2 washed the hem of one leg has come completely undone. I had to sew it quick. How annoying"
2.0,"Leg stretched out at calf &Stitching came undone, after wearing 3 times. Washed on gentle cycle & hung to dry!"
2.0,They tore on me within a month. I enjoy the gloves once they were broke in. But then they ripped all the way up the side.
2.0,See the headline as it says it all. No complaints about the company.
2.0,"These just keep riding down, so uncomfortable, disappointing."
2.0,"This bracelet is way to small, can barely clasp!! To tight for a woman’s wrist, more for a child!"
2.0,This costume jewelry broke the day it arrived after 1 use. Worthless
2.0,"I should have read the measurements for this product. its not a perfect square like the shemagh. 2 sides are sewn but the other 2 sides are cut as if it was taken from a giant roll of this item. its more like a scarf. the shemagh is better than this. my fault for not checking measurements like i said, but on behalf of the product and how the other sides were left unsewn, it will just continue to fray."
2.0,The frames are not as large as the picture shows. The frame is small...so if he you have a big head/face these glasses are not going to look right. They are for little head/face people. The picture is somewhat misleading.
2.0,they were nice at first but haven't even had these for a full month and they are falling apart
2.0,Not very good quality. Cheaply made. Would not buy again. Fits very awkwardly as well
2.0,They  were way too large for measured size.
2.0,"I just got back from a rain ride. It worked very well when the rain was small. But when it got big, it's no longer water proof. My inside pants was completely wet and I could feel the water on my legs. I expected  this to be as good as a raincoat, but it's not that strong."
2.0,"Pretty, but too small for an adult."
2.0,"Nice quality socks for the price.  However, they are supposed to be sized for an adult, but the leg section of the socks are so skinny, they would only fit a little league ballplayer or Big Bird.  The other problem was I ordered ROYAL blue and they sent NAVY blue.  Strike three, yer out!"
2.0,Too expensive nothing special
2.0,Not very good quality!  Sorry I bought it.
2.0,It seems great! and is great! until 1-2 months later when they just wear through. I even bought it twice because I liked them so much... but unfortunately those wore through quickly as well.
2.0,There is no pocket on front of jacket to put anything In it
2.0,"Don't waste your money,it might be ok for a $25 watch.very flimsy and twists out of shape !!"
2.0,"Came in fast, was nicely package. Item itself is very loose and flimsy. Could be b/c the “leather” is soft but I had to put 2 old gift cards into the front and back pocket slits to give it form also my keys fell out of the case just sitting in my purse. It’s too loose for me and defeats it’s purpose if my keys are jst gonna fall out of it. Have to look around for another one. Should have read the reviews more"
2.0,Cheaply made and returned.  Did love the style.
2.0,There’s very little arch padding foot support. Seems cheaply made and we returned  The sneakers also run small.
2.0,"these are more made for men, too big for women's feet"
2.0,They were much larger than I expected. I bought them for my second piercings and they were too big.
2.0,"This is much shorter than pictured and I'm only 5'6"". The material is extremely thin. It's nice and soft but the fact that it's so thin makes me feel uncomfortable going braless, which I would have to because the deep cut V in the back of the dress would show a strapless bra. I ended up returning it."
2.0,"I like the style and the delivery was prompt but they were too small even though I ordered XL. I have found that if they are made in China, as are these, the size runs very small, but for the price I thought I would take a chance. There is no use in returning them. I can wear them but they are very tight. I am large, 5'9&#34; and 210 libs."
2.0,These pants are nice and thick but the fitting is not very good.  It almost looks uncomfortable.  My main concern is that 2 out of the 4 pants that I ordered started to have issues with the seams.  It came undone after one wear in back and front - now its looks too broken to wear.
2.0,"Even though it’s 20mm but it fits too tight, so I had to use it in a 22mm watch."
2.0,One of them came shipped to me broken! The magnet has fallen out of one of them making it completely useless.<br />The switchable ends come off way too easily and are easily to lose if you’re not careful or don’t have really stead hands.<br />I went to see if I could get a new order shipped to me or get a refund and there is no option to message the shop or even ‘return’ the item. I’m not too impressed with this product.
2.0,Ran a little big.  They were cute until they got wet (trying to lube them up to get them out of my ear).  Now the wood is faded and the metal looks rusty.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Ordered a 4x and gave it to my son's girlfriend who is a size medium/large.
2.0,I did not receive the headband
2.0,"I ordered a small (I'm usually size 4-6) and it was humongous. The skirt was also thin and see-through, not what I was hoping for or what was pictured. I'm returning it :("
2.0,It's really pretty but completely see through up top! Could have used a liner to maybe hide some visible nips! Sending it back.
2.0,awful much too shiny in person<br />thin fabric
2.0,"Thinner than picture depicts. Must wear a tank or your bra will show.  Not long enough so the shirt doesn't puff/lay over in the waist or in the cuff of the sleeves.  If I were to raise both arms, my belly would show. FYI -  I'm 5'7&#34; and around 140lbs."
2.0,"I was not very happy with the quality of this product and after a little bit of back and forth, the seller agreed to refund my purchase. I don't recommend this product, but I will do business with this company again, because they did the right thing. The blouse fit just fine, but the cuts in the sleeves were uneven and they didn't look like they would withstand even one washing. I have plenty of tops that have slices in the sleeves and shoulders and they're great, but not this one. I'm glad the company stepped up and refunded their customer."
2.0,would have been great if they were bigger to small
2.0,"I ordered this tie for my husband after comparing a variety of gold ties on amazon. I received it quite promptly, however the tie is not anywhere near the nice gold shown in the picture. It was more of a bright shiny yellow, which is fine if I wanted yellow, but I did not. I emailed the vendor who quickly replied and gave me the information to return the tie. I would shop from this vendor again, but be careful about the color you order!"
2.0,"Very sure, but stone fell out the first day of wearing. I have requested a refund."
2.0,cute tee M fits like an XS
2.0,"Contrary to other reviews, these socks are NOT easy to get on.  They are also non-returnable. I bought them for my father and since they seemed very tight I tried to put them on which was almost impossible.  My foot felt like a sausage in the casing! I could not roll it up past the ankle and I have thin legs. I could not wait to get them off. My father would never be able to use them.  They are a good quality sock just can't get them on!"
2.0,"I wouldn't bother with these. They came with the posts bent, but I was able to bend them back, so I didn't really mind. However, they don't really look like advertised. I don't like pink, and I only got these because the soft pink with white was actually pretty cute. Instead of that, I received small white flowers with a drop of hot pink in the middle. The pink is super bright and doesn't even stay in the lines of the petals! They are ugly."
2.0,"The necklace is pretty, but the one string is longer than the other and the way it came in the plastic was folded up and its all twisted and creased up. I think it will be fine , but still cute"
2.0,Durable outside. But the seams inside have started to come apart.  I wouldn't buy again or recommend.
2.0,Dress was way too large for a medium.  Will be returning.
2.0,Not very comfortable to wear - even released to its most loose setting it is still too tight for my heard.  Oh well.
2.0,Moisture wicking is what your looking for don't buy this
2.0,Way too short. Fit like a shirt. Didn’t even cover the top of my butt
2.0,"While I like the shoe, it is not a US 5.5 as I ordered.  The sizing printed on inside of the shoe says 6M, then someone crossed it out and wrote in marker 5.5, but wishing doesn't make it so. They are too big."
2.0,"They are good quality, but it was a let down when I got them, they are pretty tiny! I guess I should of read the size dimensions."
2.0,It is not 100% cotton and it fits big and loose.
2.0,Dislike the entire watch!
2.0,These are shiny lycra...completely non professional for a work environment- more like workout wear.  Wish I would have known
2.0,These shoes were a little small.  I wore them four times and then the leather ripped by the little toe area towards the front.  I just threw them away.  I ordered another pair in a bigger size.
2.0,"Avoid: zinc alloy plating tarnishes with regular wear very, very quickly. The charm itself looks great and the bead fits great on my European style bracelet. I had the bracelet for a week and started to notice the tarnish appearing on the leading curve. No amount of cleaning with gentle jewelry cleaners or regular methods works: it's already revealing the coppery finish underneath. After a month, the bead is totally discoloured."
2.0,These don’t go high enough to cover the “thong” part of your flip flop or sandal. In addition they hurt!!
2.0,Is not a dress this is a t-shirt this is too short to be a dress when I put this on you can still see my ass cheeks. The color is pretty and when I wore it I loved it but I had to put on a pair of jean shorts up under it.
2.0,This parka is amazing! Very heavy weight. Soft. Love the ability to cinch the waist. But mine came with a dang hole in the pocket! Can’t speak to the zipper issue but hope that’s not going to be an issue too.
2.0,This thing runs huge!!!!!!!!!!!
2.0,"Wore these for 3 days, once they got wet the gloves lost their shape.  Picked up dirt easily so can't clean since the material is suede.  Ok if you are wearing them for driving and nothing outside."
2.0,"These are decent quality barbells. I don’t have sensitive skin, but I have had no reaction to them. The only issue I have, which is a big one, is that they’re ridiculously sharp. They get caught on pillowcases, shirts, beanies, headphones, and pretty much everything else. I have other jewelry like this and they are not sharp enough to pierce things. It’s very obnoxious and sometimes painful. Spend a few extra bucks on something less hazardous."
2.0,This item was great until I washed it and it now is coming apart at the shoulder seam. I've only worn in 3 times so really disappointed that it's coming apart.
2.0,I would like people to know that there is only one pair of earrings in here.  The others are all mismatch and the ones with the multiple earrings in a row look a likes don't stay close to your ear...its like they are hanging there.
2.0,I bought several of the white unitards in both adult and kid sizes. Completely see though. Will be returning.
2.0,"Cheap looking silver like chain, disappointed in quality would rather pay more for better quality and real silver. I loved the layout and concept, the length of the chain. I ended up clipping off the o-ring and pendant and am trying to fashion the same necklace using leather stripping."
2.0,"I purchased this particular belt because the buckle hinge opens at the front of the buckle where all others seen to open toward the back of the buckle. However, this buckle is way to heavy and awkward. If the buckle was plastic it would be fine. I would not recommend this belt"
2.0,It’s not balanced well. It always tilts to the left. The green stone looks fine but not shiny enough. Especially when compares to the clear color Moissanite.
2.0,The material is adorable and soft but the sizing is way off. I order a 6-12 and they are huge on my childm they fit like a 2t
2.0,I bought this to help with a problem with oversleeping and it worked great for a couple of weeks. I sent in and got a replacement free of charge but sadly after a month the new one once again failed to work. Both of them stopped zapping all together. The first I wore throughout the day and I figure I might have damaged it at work. The second one I only wore I night so that I could use it as a wake up aide. It too stopped working. I love the product but it needs a redesign or something because it just simply doesn't hold up
2.0,"Okay, apparently the common theme with this is getting the wrong name. Yup, saaaame.<br />If you get the correct name, this is a cute necklace and perfect for a teen, or just an inexpensive option if you want to trendy name yourself.<br />Packing is nice, overall nice - but it's apparently a risk getting the correct name. So if you're feeling lucky, or like going incognito - not a bad deal."
2.0,This dress is very short waisted.  Guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Really cute but the flower comes off easily
2.0,Love this brand but this fabric is awful. White areas throughout entire garment.  It does feel soft and warm though.
2.0,I couldn't get these lip piercing on for anything
2.0,Good product but the style looks weird in your ear. Tho it it would be a cool look but just looks odd. They fit good and are comfortable.
2.0,This thing is very cute and I received several compliments... but it is not built to last. Within a week one of the buttons came right off and the small handle came off. Not impressed and it ended up in the garbage (probably should've returned it). Two stars only because it did fit aesthetically what I was hoping for.
2.0,"Malísimo, llegaron solo 3, y cuando se lavan sueltan el filtro, súper malo"
2.0,Too small and the color was off!
2.0,Buttons fell off two minutes into wearing it!
2.0,"I'm really disappointed with this. I read other reviews and ordered down a size and there's still no WAY this would fit for my baby's smash cake pictures. He's big for his age and ordering down a size I still got something that would fit a 3 year old!!! I wouldn't mind so much if it was just big bc I guess he could grow into it for something besides these pictures but the shirt is also tissue paper thin, see through and SUPER itchy."
2.0,The top  was WAY too small.  Got a 2x for my mom standard size for her and it fit her like a medium.  She gave it to  me and it fit me around the arms like a large. SO Not true to size . And I did use the sizing chart.
2.0,I had it since November and it has torn already.
2.0,I bought for my mom and she doesn't see real well so it will fit its purpose of finding her house key
2.0,These are super cute but they fade very quickly and they break easily.
2.0,cheap cloth. Returned the dress
2.0,I threw them away.
2.0,"This is extremely too small and the distress on it is horrible. I am 5'7 and about 137, I got an extra large so it could be really baggy and its fitted. I don't wear an extra large in anything. If you do buy one go like 4 sizes up ."
2.0,Clasp broke off almost immediately after taking it out of the package. Also it was to small for my neck. I’m plus sized so I have a larger neck than normal I guess.
2.0,"I was sent the wrong size but was quickly sent the correct one. However, after one wearing, a rhinestone fell off. Am returning for refund this time. Too bad, it's very nice for the low price."
2.0,The insert is taller than a hipser wallet. It needs to be about 1/4&#34; less tall. It was what I needed except for size
2.0,It is too heavy (weight) and not what I expected. I would like to return the item.
2.0,This mask was too big and uncomfortable
2.0,problem silver tip gets scratched up by metal loop
2.0,I work in the back of a trailer reefer where the temp is set at -10.<br />These gloves are a waste of money and time. Finger tips froze so bad it hurt.
2.0,"Cute, but definitely didn’t agree with my skin."
2.0,Love the hat. The packing for shipping was horrible. They just put it in a bag so when the hat arrived it was pretty crushed. I think it’s going to be ok but not cool.
2.0,"It only cools a small spot on your forehead between your eyebrows and the hat brim, and then only when you are in direct sunlight.  The rest of your head and body will not notice any difference and will sweat as much with it as without it.  The only Pro's are; It's seems to be well made and it is a conversation starter."
2.0,It’s beautiful Except I haven’t even taken it out of the little bag it came in because you can clearly see the stone is missing already off of it
2.0,I like my hats to fit. The hat is large especially for women with small heads. It is uncomfortable and bulky.
2.0,I’d return this bathing suit in a second if my five year old wasn’t already in love with it. The top is too short and the bottoms are so baggy that I have to watch carefully so that her private parts don’t show.
2.0,I ordered brown and received blue. I guess I like the blue one too.
2.0,I looked inside before trying this on my granddaughter because it looked big. Well I do t know when a 6-8 became a large.<br />This is so big on her. And she needs it in 3 days for Christmas dance show. So I guess I have to take it in.
2.0,"The sleeves end half way from my elbow to my wrist, I’m usually a sm/med and I got an extra large"
2.0,I will be returning the item.
2.0,It was much shorter than expected & of cheap fabric. Not worth the price.
2.0,Very tough and not easy to insert into dress shoes. Doesn't maneuver as well as others.
2.0,"I wear a c cup, this has no support and No lift at all. I returned it. I would recommend just getting a strapless bra with some lift. I was disappointed because it had such good reviews."
2.0,Heavy - doesn't line up very well.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Just dont
2.0,underwire came out after second wash
2.0,"Don't but these,  they come undone,  hard to use. Get metal clamps instead"
2.0,"Poorly tailored, fine in a pinch but only as something you buy off the rack in the ABC before you go to a luau, but not something that you will pick out of others in your wardrobe to wear often, if at all"
2.0,Bought this as a gift for a friend and it lasted most of the winter before it started falling apart.  Do Not purchase this item it's not worth the money.
2.0,cheap just like the price and the color turned it looks dirty.
2.0,"I was really optimistic about this set, but between the very long shipping time, the overall poor quality, and the fit being off, I was left disappointed. I could get over the quality maybe if the fit were better, but overall it’s still probably twice as expensive as it should be for what you get. Also there is really no good option for returning it either, because it has to be done on your own dime."
2.0,"Earrings were beautiful!<br />However, I discovered I loss a stone the first time I wore them!"
2.0,A bit too heavy for Florida even though mother says she is always cold. This was a bit too warm for her. And the tassel on the zipper completely disintegrated in the wash. Was a mess to get cleaned out of the washer. But the color and softness are wonderful! Would be great for a truly cold home.
2.0,Too short too different
2.0,Just didn’t fit right . For being low rise the beads sit to high
2.0,"Cute, but far too small to even pull up to the knee"
2.0,"The overall fit of the shirt is on the smaller side. I was expecting a slightly oversized fit. It’s closer to a woman’s large than a man’s.<br />The material of the shirt is a little scratchy and thin. I washed it inside out, but I can’t see the print lasting a long time."
2.0,"the souls are hard, and the straps don't tighten enough. the straps are very long but they are unable to tighten around the foot for support.<br />There are much better shoes to spend your money on..."
2.0,cheap look get what you pay for
2.0,"arrived promptly and on time.  I thought price was fair.  Shorts are very very long, I'm 6' and they hung below my calves.... looked kinda capri-ish or very hood... also, they tore in the seat the first day i wore them.. likely due to the fit issues.  Wish I would have sent them back."
2.0,Although nice i expected better quality
2.0,Beautiful earrings. Unfortunately the backing that came with them was too loose and they fell out the first night. ::/
2.0,"Runs small, very tight on my daughter, and sister."
2.0,"The material was nice, but the fit was all over the place. The middle had something along the seem that made it really snug, but the top and sleeves were far too loose fitting. Had to return this one."
2.0,Not breathable. Could not wear.  Returned item.
2.0,Didnt like the fir or fabric. It just didnt flatter.
2.0,"Unreasonably thick and unwilling to bend, making it an uncomfortable wear. I spent hours after taking these back off my watch bending, twisting, folding and moving every way I could, but the fabric never loosened at all. So these are very uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,They are crooked when I put them on.
2.0,Very comfortable but they ran to small for my size 10.5-11
2.0,Tight for me
2.0,"it fit somewhat small, therefore it should order a size bigger for comfort.  Nonetheless, it is cute."
2.0,The design is super cute.  But the fabric used to make it is terrible.  I could only wear it for maybe 20 minutes because my face was so sweaty it drove me nuts.  Not very breathable. Even without the added filter layer.
2.0,"Demasiado sencilla, no es para una joven que la quiera porque no es practica, no cabe casi nada."
2.0,The lenses were decent and seem to have a slightly hydrophobic coating on them which was nice but the joints were cheap garbage. The temple broke right off at the hinge within the first 2 weeks.
2.0,I had to return these immediately. Unfortunately they were not secure and had rattled around some causing the pain to chip off. I wouldn't order these again in fear that the paint would chip off in a variety of ways.
2.0,These are ok. They're too tight for my size 11 foot and fall off my heel. Snag on shoes way too easily too.
2.0,So I love them but the only problem is they will not in screw and they are now STUCK IN MY EAR! I can't get them to open at all and I'm scared that I will blow out my ear trying to get them off!
2.0,"Much thinner than I'd hoped. I thought I'd order one, see if I like it then order other colors but I won't be ordering more of them."
2.0,The hat  did not fit well !!!
2.0,sharp piece for nose ripped through on 2 of them and cut me .
2.0,Look more generic in person
2.0,"Fits smalls, quality is fine"
2.0,"Gloves fit hand except fingers, they are freakishly long, and because of that, the touch screen tips don’t work."
2.0,I followed the size guide provided and these were very small. I fit in the bust range for the extra large and these wouldn’t even cover my tig ol bitties half way. Use caution if big chested. Otherwise I’m sure they’d fit fine on some one smaller. Also the look is very cheaply made. I found crop tops on targets website for five bucks in my size that look and feel way better than these. Two stars for fast shipping and all the shirts being in the package.
2.0,All of the gems came out within a week of purchasing it
2.0,"This glove is good for a beginner or someone who occasionally cycles. The gloves arrived quickly and were packaged nicely. However I am a XL according to the chart, but these are a medium at best. I gave them to a good friend as a gift. I can not recommend these gloves for someone with large or XL American hands"
2.0,"It would've been really nice if it was just a bit looser for that comfy, flowy look!"
2.0,returned for bad sewing and missing sequence
2.0,"While the overall quality is great, as many others have noted, the smell of goat is extreme, and will not go away even after MONTHS of ""airing out"".  I can't leave this in any closet or the entire closet takes on that smell.  Stay far away unless you really adore Eau de chevre."
2.0,"Fits nicely, went with a larger size for my middle finger. Just hope the stones don't fall out.<br />UPDATE 08-17 just realized that one of the jewels is missing already. Am returning it."
2.0,This belt was one size. It's too bad it wasn't my size. I won't order a one size again
2.0,"Great quality, bad fit. The band is tight but there's too much space on the top."
2.0,"Okay, I thought this was a little childish looking when  ordered it, but I liked the galaxy print and thought that I needed to see what it looked like in person.<br />I thought the print was cute.<br />Tried it on, and the neck is very close cut compared to the kind of nightgowns I'm accustomed to wearing these days. I felt like I was 12.<br />But holy creepy crawlies. . .the fluttery design of the sleeve makes it feel like an insect is crawling on my shoulders/upper arms so nnnnnnoooooooo! Our ceiling fans are on all the time, and I cannot be comfortable with this at all.<br />Returning."
2.0,"Nice shirt, but sized super small.  I suggest ordering at a minimum, one size larger than you normally wear."
2.0,"it's manufactured well enough, but it doesn't fit my neck on the largest setting. I had measured beforehand and thought it would work sizewise, but it was definitely a good half-inch too small. Would be better if there were more size settings- the smallest one seems pretty unnecessary, I don't know any adult with a neck that small."
2.0,Was not as long as in the picture.
2.0,"Item did not have the variation in color as deplicted.  Was more just solid red.  Kept it, but not what I had hoped."
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter's first day of school to go with her Pikachu dress. She had to wear her cat mask instead. I tried this mask on and it fit me perfectly.<br />That said, it is adorable, and seems to be made quite well."
2.0,"The price for these tights is awesome. I ordered 2 packages of 6, for a total of 12 tights. My daughter dances 4 days a week. She has danced for the past 9 years. She has been wearing these tights for the past 3 weeks. She loves how soft these tights are. But, they rip much too easily, especially at the crotch, and then they have to be thrown away. She has 4 pairs left after only 3 weeks!  (I order size XL for her to help decrease the chance for rips and tears; she is 5' 9"" and 145 pounds.) I usually buy 5 pairs of more expensive brand name tights that end up lasting her 1 year before having to be thrown away. I will have to buy more tights for her, and I will not buy these again. I would NOT recommend these tights."
2.0,The snakes look nothing like snakes just a blur
2.0,I overpaid! Product was right as described however the original Nike tag was on it and was $25 but I paid $29.99 through this sell. Next time I will go directly through Nike.
2.0,"The ring connecting the pendant to the chain is loose, has no spring tension, and is of a very poor quality. I will have to replace the ring in order to wear this item. Not a good quality item - very poor."
2.0,"So my girlfriend bought these expecting them to really show her butt off. They are very “texterous” and quite spiky? They leave a dotted pattern imprinted on her legs if she wears them for even for a couple hours. To make things easier for you, the reader, let’s break down the pros and cons.<br /><br />PROS—<br />1) they really show off the butt crack<br />2) they are thick and warm<br />3) they are more leggings<br />CONS—<br />1) comfort is not great. Kind of restricting.<br />2) feels flimsy in the butt. She didn’t feel comfortable bending down.<br />3) Cant pull them up all they way. The way the seam goes down from the butt and coochie makes the crotch not stay tight to the puss.  She says it seems like they are made too small.<br />4) Scratchy<br />5) Small rip formed as soon as she first put them on.<br /><br />OVERALL— I wouldn’t buy them. They are not well made and will likely rip after a few weeks of wearing. If you insist on getting them to show off your goods then get a size up so they can at least fit tight to the places that need to be tight. And so you can pull them up all the way. Don’t be surprised when you first them out of the box and they seem like there sized for a toddler."
2.0,"I ordered two different colors of this top, a solid color and a floral pattern. I knew I’d like the solid because I’d already ordered another and was happy with it. But when the items arrived I unhappily discovered that the floral was a completely different fabric, cut and fit. It's a much heavier fabric, and definitely not chiffon. It is cut straight at the front hem, not gently curved, and overall much longer than the solid. Worst of all, it’s tight across the back, and instead of the pleats that are taken at the shoulder of the solid, this is just cut straight down, meaning there’s no drape over the bodice area and so, of course, no tummy hiding is possible at all. Picture the solid colors with a foot of fabric chopped out of the front middle area. I’m returning it. (The solid colors are wonderful, I recommend them)."
2.0,After three uses the top straps started to strip  and I will not go out with a bag handle looking like that.  I will not use it.
2.0,"I sprayed the hat, molded, and let it dry  it doesn’t really stiffen at all. The shape isn’t really retained"
2.0,These are cheap throwaway things. They might last for an hour or two each. They'll also come in a bag that will fall apart and leave you finding them all throughout your package.
2.0,Jacket not true to size at all very small. Kind of disappointed.
2.0,Son loved look but cheapy material
2.0,To be fair these are very inexpensive. But the quality is terrible. Looks like scuffed tarnished metal.
2.0,"Based on the sizing chart, I originally ordered one size up - a large.  That was too small.  Ordered another, this time a 2X.  That was not much bigger than the large.  Also, the sweater does not lay right.  Looks like the lining and sweater were not sized properly.  The actual sweater part is very thin; do not see it lasting very long.  The picture is not a good representation of the real sweater.  The sizing chart is way, way off.  It's a lot of money for a poorly made, cheaply made sweater."
2.0,The shoes are adorable but so cheaply made. The bottom peeled after the first wear and the photo is after three days. Maybe ok if only wear indoors or for a special occasion otherwise pass.
2.0,I like the case but it does not fit my Galaxy S7 Edge
2.0,"This dress is cute on the bottom is not as full as the picture shows however the black one that I received the hem isn't even it hits the floor in some areas and is on top of my foot in other areas and I didn't really notice until I already had it on and was out in public so I just had to make the best of it<br />Clearly there is no quality control before things are shipped out.<br /> I bought the blue one and it was very cute and the hem was fine, but still not as full as the picture shows"
2.0,too large from top.
2.0,Bright white plastic snap in the bust area was too contrasting to the fabric and for the price point of the item made it seem really cheap.
2.0,extra extra small
2.0,Shoes are cute but hurt in between my toes. Didn’t wear for long.
2.0,The shirt was suppose to be black but it was blue an that was disappointing.
2.0,This dress is nice - have a good thickness too but was not flattering on me. The top was loose and wide (I am petite). It maybe just my body type but I can see this would be flattering on a apple type body.
2.0,Purchased another set from a different company and the material is excellent!  This material was scratchy with wide mesh holes compared to the other product. Seller was great to deal with which is always a bonus in this type of situation.
2.0,Bought these for my grandfather to keep up with his glasses and they broke after 2 weeks. The clip that goes onto the glasses stayed on but the leather came out of the clip part that holds the leather to the clip. *sigh* can anything be made to last these days?
2.0,I like the shirt but the pants are like hunky and the material is cheap made
2.0,"These are cute BUT you get an &#34;array&#34; of colors NOT all the ones pictured. For example I received 6 pink variations, a 2 purple, a white, and a purple/coral combo. Not what I was expecting. So I was quite disappointed. They seem like they'll last only a little bit which is fine because I paid $1 a piece. Just don't expect the picture at all."
2.0,"I got the 0047blue and 0057wine red colors. For the blue one, instead of normal sweatshirt look and feel, it had a shiny surface and screamed CHEAP! Turned out it's 85% polyester. I put it back into the bag without trying it on and returned. The wine red version looked normal. However, the seams where colors meet all had a thick edge inside, maybe 0.5cm. So I could feel every seam on my arms and sometimes on my body too. It was uncomfortable. Returned as well."
2.0,"Too small, both in legs and body.  Crawls up her butt."
2.0,This swim suit fits well and is very cute and my husband really seems to like it on me. I have had 3 c sections so this swim suit covers up what i don't want people to see but looks cute doing it and my husband says it makes me look skinnier. The biggest issue that i have had with it is that one of the under wires came popping out after only 2 or 3 uses which was very disappointing. This swim suite was inexpensive and very cute i just wish that the construction was better. If they fix the quality i would buy another but the quality is just to disappointing to buy again.
2.0,Looks cute but fits terribly.
2.0,"They were all  sewn differently and very small ( i am 5'3"" and weight about 105 lbs).  The fabric was cheap and they just looked so crooked and misshapen.  Very disappointing."
2.0,"looks more like a night gown on me, most likely to return"
2.0,Too small. I ordered a large and it did not fit around my waist.  No stretch and not very giving.  Beautiful quality just bad sizing.
2.0,"I ordered the right size for me, but it did fit well. Too baggy. The quality of the material was not as I had expected."
2.0,"Pretty but HUGE, not flattering at all. Actually looks better on my husband than on me!  One size does not fit all and I should know that...."
2.0,super small. you cant ask for for considering the price tho.
2.0,"the waist band is not a single piece. it is the thin material w an elastic band loose inside. i didn't like this at all and like any loose elastic bands, i fully expect it to get twisted after the first wash. the scrunched butt otherwise was as expected and looked good but the waist band is a no for me. the legs were also really long. i'm 5'3, ordered a medium and they were bunched at the bottom (even though i'm on the short side, this is not typically an issue for me)"
2.0,"While I enjoy the pockets, texture, and colors.  They are made for a much taller person. I'm 5'4"" and they would fit someone at least 5'7"" or taller. I've had them about a month and one pair the top elastic snapped (max of 8x worn). I in no way overstretched these as they were constantly slipping down from the get go. So now I will have to open up a seem and fix it, which is frustrating."
2.0,It was the material that I did not like
2.0,Shirt is paper thin. A few washes and this will fall apart - hence the price.
2.0,These are not 100% cotton as stated. They are very thin with no spot for a filter.
2.0,"The fit is strange tight in the wrong places, loose in the wrong places.Not for me, sadly"
2.0,"After using for a few weeks I'm no longer using it.<br /> Seems too short.  Have to remove band from bracket each time since it isn't long enough to slide off my wrist.  The magnetic latch slips and the band loosens.  The fit sliding into the band mounts is not great, took a few tries and was tight."
2.0,"So, it fits well.  I ordered a 2X. In women's sizing, I'm about a size 16 in the bust, but a size 14 for my more waist area.  I maybe could have gotten away with a 1X because the material has a little bit of stretch.  Zipper is functional, which is cool.  The color appears closer to hot pink to me, than the more coral pink I see on my screen to me too.<br /><br />But why a 2 star rating?  The sewn waist area for the peplum~ish look...it's not even. The two do NOT meet in the same place where the zipper is and it makes it look poorly made, like I got it from the rejects pile at a thrift store.  For reference, it's a good inch difference between where the 2 seams begin.<br /><br />So I'll be returning it. :("
2.0,"Love the different neckline on these, compared to standard A shirts.after a couple washes they’re too short to wear - lost about 6” in length. Can’t even stretch them out to make them wearable around the house."
2.0,The rings needed to be able to open which they don't
2.0,"Pretty, but they were not long enough 19&#34; instead of 21&#34; as advertised.  They would have been perfect if they had been the length advertised."
2.0,The shorts are even shorter than I thought they would be and that’s saying something! The top is thin and has thick bra pads in it that you can totally see through the fabric which is super tacky looking!
2.0,It's cute but the elastic isn't secure enough to stay on baby's head. Baby's head isn't too small and it kept sliding down over her eyes. Just monitor baby. She wasn't able to sleep with it at night due to safety
2.0,"The picture shows that these are solid purple masks, but they ended up still having a white border. Not worth sending back, but they were not as advertised."
2.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone. After receiving it, I decided not to give it to her because it looks so thin and cheap, not like the picture. So, I wore it myself for a day trying to decide what to do with it. It is so thin, it easily bent out of shape. I decided to give it to my little girl as a play ring. :("
2.0,Much smaller and seemingly more flimsy than the photo. Returned.
2.0,The cup size is good and the shoulder straps are fine but the length from eyes to hooks stretched out are about 32&#34; to 33&#34;. It was listed as a 38&#34;. Very disappointed. Will not reorder.
2.0,BAD GUALETY
2.0,"I somehow thought they were clip on, due to having one earlobe slit and unable to wear 'normal' earrings. They are useless. But it's my fault."
2.0,"Somewhat small and the top snap broke on the first wearing. I can still wear it, but really, it broke the first time I put it on?!!?"
2.0,"The shoes are darling but when opening them, the bow was falling apart. :("
2.0,While I like the light weight and warmth they twist around and wind up with no traction on the bottom. Maybe they will stay straight on your foot but it won't on mine.
2.0,Has slits on the bottom very disappointed
2.0,"Super cute and I got lots of compliments on these. However, just a couple of months in, the bow broke; just snapped right off when I hugged someone! I superglued it back on and then the other side broke in the same spot!"
2.0,"Material is fine: Thin and light. The sizing is MUCH smaller. I wear a L in linen pants I've purchased. I read these run small so I ordered an XL they were still about 2 sizes too small. Very disappointing, especially considering the extended wait time."
2.0,"Not very well terminated, with some issues in the fabric. I would not recommend it."
2.0,The color is exactly what I hoped it would be but if you have a larger bust it’s not going to work out very well. My best friend and I both got it to possibly use her bridesmaids dresses. I am a extra large and normal clothing and my boobs were extremely squashed and they looks deformed because of the way the dress laid. The material is very very soft and would be very comfortable if they made it in a larger size
2.0,Wrong  Letter  I ordered  the letter  S I got the letter  A
2.0,"Cute, but not supportive enough for working out which is what i bought them for (and i don’t need much support). They are comfy for a sleep bra or loungewear. Nice colors."
2.0,Should have bought a size up. This dress is pretty tight. Bodycon like fit.
2.0,The layout is nice. The purse itself is not as good of a quality as I thought it was going to be... and it's super big. And teeth on the zipper is missing!!!! WTH!?
2.0,"This could have been a great shirt— soft material and nice style. HOWEVER there was no hemming at all— sleeves, bottom, collar. The collar was made with the fabric flipped in and attached with 2 small stitches. I imagine that after some wear and washes it would unravel. This is probably why it was so inexpensive. Half finished."
2.0,"Good looking bag. MISSIMG SHOULDER STRAP.  It as the discription states: “ an adjustable shoulder strap is included for added support. I’m about to take a 3K mile motorcycle trip and didn’t bed the added stress of dealing with miss managed items. As for the bag itself, so far ( out of package) nice."
2.0,I like the concept but it seemed the demensions were all wrong. What look like it started as a pocket was incomplete so it was sticking out and one side was longer then the other.
2.0,The little tag 925 fell off and then it fell apart
2.0,I bought 2 bracelets 1 for each of my daughters and they both broke already.
2.0,You definitely get what you pay for in this case.  Very cheap looking.
2.0,"I got this product in hopes of my stomach. When putting it on, it fits tight and I felt as if it would slim my stomach area while in this dress. However, you could see the seems through the dress and it didn't shape much. I will have to continue my search for a product that will shape my body..."
2.0,"I’m giving this 2 stars because the bracelet that comes with it didn’t have the clip to use, the necklace gave a charm that doesn’t even fit on the necklace (too small). And the book bag itself feels very cheap."
2.0,The sleeves were too short. Also the seam where the two different colored fabrics meet is very uncomfortable. I ended up cutting off the arms into short sleeves to be able to use this. I do however like the large pockets.
2.0,Soft material but it was super cropped and I’m short 5ft so I need led to return it.
2.0,Does not fit comfortable or right it slides around and does not stay in place when exercising . it cost a lot of money not to work right. The shipping time was good the only thing that worked right. I bought it based on review. This time they were wrong. Don't buy.
2.0,I bought this in the exact size as a gift and it is two sizes too small
2.0,"It seems so cheaply made, almost as if the rain could puncture through.  It's also small, good for a child, or a head, but that's it."
2.0,i like the saying on the shorts. but the material is to thin. my girl said you not wearing that to the gym. you can see private area through shorts.
2.0,Description of jogger or sport wear is not accurate. Material very sheer. This should described a pajama wear or thermals.
2.0,The quality is fine but the size is too big. I ordered small and on my legs they fit fine but on my hips and front it doesn’t fit right.. just feels and looks weird on me..
2.0,not not good
2.0,this is very tiny in size and you can barely see any diamond in it... doesn't look as glam for the price
2.0,Halloween costume looking. Not as sleek or sophisticated as picture appears.
2.0,"What a disappointment.  I know it is an inexpensive (definitely) watch and mirrors one of their first designs.  It is really small and looks incredibly cheap.  I do not have a large wrist and the band barely fits.  Because of its size, it just looks awful when I wear it.  If I'm going down memory lane, I'll do it without this watch.  Into the drawer it goes."
2.0,Could have been cute but rough and cheap and small. Fit my 7 year old.
2.0,Construction of holder is not conducive to swiping and not sure if there is adequate space for the ID or any additional cards.
2.0,"I usually wear size 6, but got size 8-10 after reading reviews, and it fit, but snugly. I got it for a costume party and was good for that purpose, but won't hold up for repeat wears.  The zipper was impossible for my husband even to help me get closed, and the first time I washed it 2 buttons came off.  It did look good and got compliments."
2.0,"Much too tight in the chest. I’m 5’3” and a 32B, so this is not a problem I’m used to having. I bought an XS. It fit well through the shoulders and was a bit loose around the waist but was tight in the chest, which caused the buttons to stretch and the waist to ride up. There was too much fabric at the small of my back. I don’t think this garment was made for women.  I am returning."
2.0,"Odd fit, can’t tell which way is front or back. Hangs wierd."
2.0,ehhhhhehhh
2.0,I bought this clip on a few years ago and they worked fine on my glasses.  Eventually they broke because I'd drop the glasses now and then.  So I just ordered the same ones and they didn't fit.  The clips wouldn't hold on to the side of the glasses. I requested a refund and ordered another pair hoping it was just a fluke that the new ones didn't work.  Well the newer ones work slightly better but they are bent and so one of the clips doesn't do anything so the sunglasses are only holding on to the glasses with 3 clips.  If these end up not staying on I will return them and look for another brand entirely.
2.0,Within a week both keychains came off their rings. My husband lost his.
2.0,Cheap band that is cheaply made.  The pictures represent one week of wear.  Don't waste your money.
2.0,"The pads don’t stay put, I have to teenager that are in competitive cheer. We had to sew them in so they wouldn’t move around."
2.0,"The fit is waaay too large. Talk about vanity sizing. This is more like a 2X, or bigger."
2.0,"It does feel kinda janky when you are trying to put it in, but it worked for me. I don't have gauges or anything just regular pierced ears. Only problem is I cannot really wear them as they had some sort of scratched damage. Both sides looked like they had been nicked with a box cutter or something. It is pretty obvious and it doesn't look good. If could ignore the damage I'd love these!"
2.0,"Ordered these 2 months ago, I work 5 days a week sometimes 6 as FedEx driver.  These boots dont really get beat up like a construction worker. All they do is get walked in and rained on and they are already falling apart. The bottom of them are thin so you feel most of the rocks you step on and they laces aready broke. Should have not been so cheap when buying boots but for the $40 some dollars i paid for them, should problem get better miles."
2.0,"Don't waste your money, the picture does not match what you actually receive.<br />It's stinky, cheap and weird looking, feels like you're wearing some trash bag.<br />I am sorry for those who found this weird sweater nice or good, obviously they never had any good clothes.<br />Ciao!"
2.0,Way too small & I returned it
2.0,"Cheap crap. Didn’t realize until I got them that they weren’t full leather. Thin fabric with what I swear was FAKE leather accents and backs. I miss the days when I could get a nice, full leather glove with Thinsulate, which are great for driving in winter. I have worn that style glove for 20 years, and now they’re almost impossible to find. Apparently Isotoner doesn’t make any at all. These flimsy things got sent back for poor, too-slim a fit with overly long fingers, and overall lack of warmth and functionality for driving and gripping anything. Can’t see where they’d be any good to someone using a phone, either, since the mostly fabric palms were slick as heck. Better get insurance on your device if you plan to use these “touch screen compatible” gloves with it."
2.0,Arms to tight
2.0,I like the style and color but the material after the first wash wrinkled badly and I did not even put it in the dryer I let it air dry and it still kept the wrinkles. The reason why I bought this I was hoping to avoid ironing but it would appear that I will need iron if I want to look presentable in public.
2.0,"The branding doesn't match the quality here. I was hoping for a comfortable shoe. It was evident that blisters would be inevitable on these, so I returned them. They also run a little narrow."
2.0,They look as high quality as the amount you pay for them
2.0,Like but I just thought the gold would look better ...like the necklace in the picture better
2.0,"This hat is adjustable, but not for me. It was cute, but so big, it couldn't be made small enough. It runs really large"
2.0,This leather vest is very heavy and material is very hard. Item returned.
2.0,They fall off my daughters feet all the time
2.0,Extremely small. Would not fit my 12 yr old.
2.0,Started to fall apart and I was only trying it on. 2 stars because it actually look like the picture
2.0,"bought my regular size, but they ran small."
2.0,"They don't shine, not even a little 1.q"
2.0,If you are older than 17 don't buy!
2.0,"So i bought these for $8, it says original $25, i would never spend $25 dollars on these. id say they are worth $5. they feel like those cheap thin felty gloves you'd buy from a craft store for $3. I really like the timberland brand so i figured if they put their name on it they had to be decent, but apparently not. they also run really small and tight. i probably wont wear these much honestly. would not buy again ever."
2.0,Dispenser was broken.
2.0,"I bought 3 of these tops,in different colors. I am very disappointed  due to they are more wide than long, I bought extra lg,size due to most run very tight in the bust area.I found these droop terribly, I even tried to shorten the straps for a more flattering  fit,,but armholes cut out to huge, can't wear these and look attractive. ."
2.0,not what I though love it the camo
2.0,"First of all Amazon said it was delivered April 30th and it actually arrived on May 12th. The size didn't work for me. The top was too small and the leg openings were too large. I really think for myself, bathing suits need to be purchased in person. I felt the material was a bit flimsy as well. Not what I expected. For me it didn't work but for someone else who is more of a pear shape it may work better."
2.0,"Cute watch, but the pin won't stay in - came apart twice.  I'm returning it."
2.0,I dont know what a size 44 is but thats what i got and it was too small im 5’5 194 i wear XL usually 44DD my boobs way to big in this but its very pretty cant see myself actually swimming in this but its cute
2.0,"Unfortunately, this was a shirt that looks extremely cheap, doesn't really fil well, and looks very 'unmanly'"
2.0,"I don’t really like them,"
2.0,They look very cheap and they already tarnished. I would not recommend them to any one much less a friend.
2.0,"I love this leggings so much , fit perfectly like other Aoxjox leggings I have but unfortunately the seam in the middle ripped at the second use and that show everything when I was climbing up high 😤 ."
2.0,I do love the dress. Took forever to come in. I was so excited. And it fit way too big!
2.0,Not as pictured. Item came with 5 petals as opposed to 7 AND the center is much smaller.
2.0,"This is the same, traditional nude made for caucasian and lighter skin tones.  It appears to be the exact same as the nude color option that they also sell.  I have no idea why they are selling this under another name."
2.0,"I'm pretty disappointed with this mask. First, I ordered two knowing that these are made in China and may not be the best quality. Sure enough one mask fit nicely and the second was way too small and I couldn't even blink my eyes without hitting the inside of the mask. Second, this is a complete rip off of the Smiffy's made mask. I ordered both and you can tell this is a direct pull or copy of that mask as this is the identical mask but has a lot less definition and detail in the mask which tells me this is a copy."
2.0,I'm sad about this product. It is beautiful and held up well. But I had have my belly button pierced for four years and never had an infection before and this ring irritated it so badly to the point where I can't put any other ring in. I really wanted to love this product but it really hurt the piercing hole.
2.0,"I like the colors and the patterns and I really wanted to like these socks; however, these socks seem to be made for children - not adults.  The sock is way too small for an adult foot.  My foot is not exceptionally large and I really have never had a problem with socks fitting before.  First, the socks were difficult to get over my heel.  I thought it maybe had something to do with the intricate pattern and that they would stretch a little once worn.  Wrong.  Within minutes my legs seemed to actually be swollen above the socks and they were also difficult to remove.  I will not buy these again."
2.0,Just make better stuff please.  And is isn't like this was $9.  It was $25.
2.0,"Too long for people 5'5"" and under"
2.0,"The size was suppose to be a 2X, but it look like it was a size  small. the quality was nice."
2.0,Glasses are not polarized. The frames are too flimsy and snapped while simply unfolding to wear. I wish the frames were stronger. I did find them helpful while working at computer. I am an Eagle Eye fan. I can't justify the expense for this product.
2.0,"Pretty color, just a little snug and very see through."
2.0,"Have to return back, I ordered size 6, my daughter size 5, but we wasnit able to put onthe foot"
2.0,"Nice, runs small"
2.0,skimpy and too tight
2.0,"This is a flattering and comfortable postpartum dress made of a very breathable, stretchy fabric that I love. However, the tiered seams are not sewn with a similarly stretchy thread and are easily prone to ripping out as the cloth stretches. Very disappointing."
2.0,The watch looks great but after using for two months the battery died. Now I have to spend an extra $$ to get the battery replaced.
2.0,Gave to friend. Too big!
2.0,LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE LOOSE FITTING BUT IT'S NOT. SNUG. BOUGHT THE SAME SIZE AS I HAVE IN OTHER SHIRTS AND THEY FIT WONDERFUL BUT THIS ONE IS CLINGY AND SNUG. YES NOW I NEED TO LOOSE WEIGHT TO LOOK IN THIS SHIRT.
2.0,These shorts are very small. They look like children's shorts. The above photo is a picture of a 12/14 large in boys comparing to the 12/14 large in women's that I received. As you can see there isn't much of a size difference.
2.0,"Loved this band but when I received it the pin was out. After many attempts I got the pin in, wore it 4 times, then the pin popped out again and I couldn’t get it back in. Had it less then a month so I returned for a full refund though with free return shipping."
2.0,I return this item made in China not original
2.0,Too large they look cheap!
2.0,This looks nothing like the picture. It is not green and not sure it is real jade.
2.0,"I was extremely excited to get this dress, it was exactly what I was looking for. When I tried it on, I was so disappointed. First thing is, I knew the skirt of the dress was going to be shear, it has a slip so I wasn’t worried about it, what I didn’t realize was almost the whole dress is shear, the only part that isn’t, is the breast area. The elastic band around the waist is shear and I could see the bottom part of my bra, the back of the top I could see my bra as well. I could’ve dealt with all of that, but the worst part about the dress was the awkward waistline/breast area, maybe my breasts are too big for the size I ordered, but the elastic band rode half way up my breasts. The idea of the dress is great, maybe it’ll work for someone with smaller breasts, the color was nice, the fabric was cheap as well. I ended up returning  the dress."
2.0,Not impressed. Cheaply made. Looked like it came out of a toy vending machine.  Returned and do not recommend this watch.
2.0,"The bottom fits well and is decent. The top I lost the top bottom within 5 minutes and the last button the 2and time I wore it. I am 1 button away from showing everyone my boobs, not cool. I am going to attach my own buttons."
2.0,Two have already broken and i Just got them. Crappy product.
2.0,"I’m 5’3, 134lbs, size 4, S in leggings. I got these in a Small and they’re too long and too big. U can see all the extra material in the pics of my crotch (sorry but had to show u how bad these looked on me). If you’re taller than me and have hips/are curvy these might work for u. Otherwise I didn’t like these for me. It’s stretchy but has no compression so it doesn’t hold the tummy in and it sags like crazy. Really uncomfortable and bothersome to workout in. The fabric feels cheap, thin, not breathable. And again u can see in the pics that it shows sweat.<br />I do like the color and cutout design so if u like them and are taller and curvier than me then these might work for u. If you’re my height, body size, or shorter and thinner then skip these."
2.0,"Purchased the small, as that is my usual size, and it was big on me. It also was pretty see-through and the wrong color. I ordered the salmon too/tan flowery bottom. Instead of tan, the bottom was white."
2.0,"Top is tight and narrow, so much that my mother was concerned about it cutting off circulation. It's a shame, because my mom loves frogs."
2.0,"Similar to other reviews, sweater arrived with creases that could not be removed with ironing. Although fit was as expected and it looked cute, the material was a little scratchy. However the permanent creasing made it look too sloppy and unpresentable to by pass the somewhat scratchy feel. Disappointing purchase, and will be returned."
2.0,Dress is cute and flattering but the polka dots down the front of the seam is off... or the tag is sewn on the wrong side of the dress and the seam should be in the back.
2.0,"This is the second time that I have ordered these sunglasses, because I think that they are really cute and they don't have the nose pads that pull your hair out of a ponytail, however, the screw holding the glasses together comes loose. The screw small so it is easily lost, and if you do find it you cannot get it back in."
2.0,I liked the design.  But it was too hard to zip.  Sent it. Back.
2.0,"The high waist is nice but it's too loose and falls down and sags. I'd size down but the legs are already too slim. I'm 5'10"" 155lbs (with a bit of a ""mom belly"" I'm trying to hide) and bought a size large. The fabric is nice and the cut, they just aren't ideal bc they won't stay up."
2.0,"Mine was definitely not Navy as it said. It was black.  Which is fine, but annoying that it's not what it said.  I'm 5'9, wear a medium top and usually a size 8 or 10 bottoms.  Its snug around the bum and the empire draw string doesn't fit under my boobs.  Because of that, it is not a flattering fit at all.  The length is fine - it hits right around my ankles so I won't trip over it.  I know other reviews say it would fit a size 12 and under - trust me - I would go size 8 or under if you want it to be comfortable."
2.0,"Edit: I do love the color of the bottles but had to replace the spray nozzles as they don't have a good spray.  Customer Service reached out to me and asked if they could replace the product but as I'd already replaced it myself, they refunded me the entire amount of the items.  Well done on the end of Customer Service.<br /><br />Pretty color bottle but the quality of the spray nozzle is horrible."
2.0,it not the same fabric as the picture. looks different. not sure if I like it.
2.0,The material was thin and the fit was like a 2x !
2.0,Very fragile and break with relative ease.
2.0,Runs 2 sizes small..made for short people..models must be midgets.
2.0,"Not  good quality, using them for bjj classes, knees are are start loosing color and become white after second class"
2.0,"I love this style. I had almost every color except apricot.  What arrived was different from all the others.  The Fabric was very thin, not likely to survive many washings.  In addition this item was too snug across the arms.  Pulling and relying on the fabrics ability to stretch.  Hopefully they go back to the older fabric and sewing style."
2.0,It feels a little rough. I’m hoping washing it makes it softer. It runs small. Really tight considering I bought it for a hospital stay after delivery.
2.0,"The shape and thickness of the sole is throwing off my gait and stance. When standing in them, the outside of my feet are higher than the insides, causing my knees to come together lol"
2.0,"I ordered an XL and it is way too small.  It even says L inside and it is from China, so probably runs extra small to begin with.  The fabric is also pretty thin and see-through."
2.0,One of the bracelets fell apart.  The charms and magnets fell off and I saw the individual items on Amazon.  I could make 10 bracelets for the price I paid for this set.  Cute idea but cheaply executed.
2.0,"There's no fly, so the overalls have to taken off to use the restroom"
2.0,"I read reviews and most said that the fit is a little on the large size.  I'm 5'8"" and 135 pounds, so I ordered the medium in grey.  It's nice and long enough, but it is tight esp. around the waist.  If you don't mind every lump and bump showing, it's fine. I returned it and ordered size large in the navy and it fit perfectly."
2.0,"I really was looking forward to wearing this dress to my company holiday lunch.<br /><br />I tried it on multiple times, but when I put my arms down and was getting things ready and touching up my makeup, the chaffing on both arms had causes lots of red marks and was so uncomfortable I had to change my dress."
2.0,I liked the quality of the fabric.  But being curvy girl the shorts didn't sit well onnmy curves. They slid down. I had to constantly pull them up. It was a bit annoying. Had to take them off during my shift at work. I bought these to wear under dresses & skirts.
2.0,Looks and feels cheap. Like a ring out of a gum ball machine..
2.0,"I was disappointed with this scarf.  The material is just knit with holes in it, but the fabric (while very soft!) does not have any stiffness to it, so the ruffles don't ruffle-- they lay flat.  It ends up looking like a textured flat weave-- not a ruffled weave.  It is soft, and warm, but does not dress up outfits or have any wow factor.  It just... lays there."
2.0,Looks really cute on my 4.5 year old. Pattern is a little different than the picture.  My only complaint is that one of the seams has come unraveled and needs resewn.<br /><br />Update: only wore it once and after washing it it shrunk and seams are coming undone. Waste of money.
2.0,"This tee is a stretch material, not a fan. The graphics should have been a different color, you can’t really see the graphics. Would not recommend, poor fit, good thing I went up a size and ( site recommends size L, ordered XL)  I probably will not wear it! :("
2.0,The area where the bow is supposed to go didn’t sit properly. Looked like it was hanging.
2.0,I got extra large which is what I have ordered before but this was too small. I couldn’t buttoned it
2.0,Shrinkage is horrible!! I collect Linen...this is not Linen.
2.0,The cup size measurement were way off
2.0,Disliked the quality and very poor quality. Very Disappointed!
2.0,Fits tight around ankles.
2.0,Ok- but shorts too small
2.0,The shirts did not live up to the picture the material was two sheer.
2.0,"So. Tiny. Had to return it, the shorts part were hilarious until I cried."
2.0,My daughter loves the hat but the light blue Pom Pom that doesn't inflate the braid fell off after 4 days.
2.0,"Yeah, a 1/4 inch of padding! If you prefer unlined cups, as I do, this Makeda Spacer Bra will make your chest look ridiculously rounded and over-stuffed, as it did on me. Furthermore, there is no elastic on the upper edge of the cups, so they gape away from the body when bending over. Just awful!, especially since Anita is known for elasticizing the tops of their bra cups and shying away from any sort of padding (see The Anita Rosa Faia Aurelia Allover Lace Underwire Bra 5672). The band however fits perfectly to size: a 40 E is a 40E."
2.0,Not very clear lens. Everything is a bit blurred when wearing.
2.0,"I returned this handbag because it wasn't a true navy, more of just a blue. Also, the amount of shiny goldtone trim was greater than I had expected from the product photo. For example, the top has a big goldtone zipper and there's shiny trim on the tassel pull. Too bling-y and not my style!"
2.0,Material clings and runs a bit small..so size up if you're not a skinny gal.
2.0,The pattern in the color are really cute but the material is almost like a quilted neoprene so it wasn't very comfortable to wear and didn't fit very well
2.0,The photo online appears like it has a nice cut and allows the stone to shine.  The stone ended up being very dull and dark.  This stone is not as bright and colorful as the photo shows it.  I did end up returning this ring and shipping charges were costly.  I printed the return label and shipped it as directed but ended up only getting about 75% of the original purchase price back.  They were prompt with delivery but would be hesitant to order another ring that has a stone.
2.0,"They were a bit smaller than represented, but love the look. They are not much bigger than the button it replaces."
2.0,"I am a 36 C and this was supposed to hold up well, but it does not. It sticks out too much. Good quality but i guess for small chest."
2.0,Very cute pants but the sizes are definitely not plus size as advertised. Fits very small.
2.0,Just too small. And I got two sizes over what I would normally get.
2.0,"Disappointing tanks. Good built in bra but way too short, shows my stomach. I'm 5'9&#34; so maybe it'll fit shorter girls"
2.0,Fits pretty good but quality isn’t great. I put them on and went to the gym - first wear already has seam problems. I should’ve just spent the money on leggings from old navy.
2.0,It’s cheep junk I donated it looks nothing like the photo
2.0,Lens scratched up within first hour
2.0,"Advertised as squatting shorts, so I assumed they’d be shorter than regular gym shorts. Ordered my regular waist size and got shorts that come all the way down to my knees. This is not at all ideal for running or squatting..."
2.0,"Loved the material, but if your looking for a baggy comfy shirt like the photos do not buy this! It is still cute on but more like a regular fitted T-shirt, I am a US size 6-8 and I ordered the large because I wanted it baggy/comfy.... That was definitely not what I got."
2.0,I’m 23 weeks pregnant 5’0 tall and was thinking this would be cute for my baby shower but no. It fits very large and is just not cute. I think it’s made for taller/larger body types. It wasn’t even super long; would have been fine with a small heel/wedge but the rest of the dress is very baggy.
2.0,"It feels too tight.<br />The short is too short.<br />I feel clumsy, cannot wear in 24-hr gym."
2.0,"These are very pretty earrings. I really liked them. However, I have to make a couple suggestions though. The pair I received, the posts were very weak and the upper clasp wouldn’t stay on my ears so the top of the earrings would fall. I was able to get them to stay in place long enough to take the pics. Otherwise, I really liked these earrings."
2.0,Love the style love how comfy it is. Do not love how easily it gets lint all over in two seconds. Looks like I haven’t washed it when I just pulled out of dryer three seconds before clean. All of sudden dust and lint sticks like glue. Eh.
2.0,Some parts of the bracelet started fading after 3 weeks of wearing them every other day or so. They're  just okay. Nothing more or less.
2.0,Fit is small.  Had to return.
2.0,Very see thru.  Not sturdy material at all.
2.0,"Fits smaller than expected. Fabric isn’t stretchy, it’s a woven cotton or linen type fabric so the crotch on mine ripped when I sat down. Size up 2 or 3 sizes if you get this."
2.0,"The tights stretch out as the day goes on, becoming very uncomfortable."
2.0,"Not what I hoped for at all.  The polyester fabric was slippery to the point of slimy and is only handwashable.  The sleeve openings are huge and gaping,  but I liked the length and width.  The pants were another story.  I am short, only 5’1”, but I should not be able to pull the pants over my chest.  If they were shooting for a natural waistline, they overshot by 4”.  They had tight elastic, but the whole thing had enough fabric I could have fit two of me inside it and still have more draping on the floor."
2.0,This item is very thin and isn’t soft.  I wish it was thicker and softer.
2.0,Not made for large breasts
2.0,Poorly stitched and the cups in the bra are bulgy.
2.0,The inner lining is supposed to keep the shorts from riding up...they are not tight enough and causes the short to ride up on my legs...also the elastic waist is bunched up and makes my butt look puffy
2.0,Falls out easily :(
2.0,"These panties are cute, but after a few washes,  the color fades and the lace falls apart and stretches. Not recommended"
2.0,Soft cloths but are very small. Fits partially on the shoulder.
2.0,"Low quality. This band held up under normal use for about 2 or 3 months before becoming completely unusable. The main issue: the buckle hole stretched and eventually broke, merging with the hole of the next size. I could never get the band tight on my wrist again.<br /><br />Additionally the black paint began rubbing/chipping off in the first few weeks. This was not a big deal for me, but it definitely didn't look good.<br /><br />There are much better NATO straps out there for the same price or a few bucks more."
2.0,"If you're looking for some ultra low cost sunglasses for short term use, then you may find these satisfactory. However, they did not last long for me. I found that on a hot day outside when I had sunscreen on my face, the coating on the nose piece would flake off very easily."
2.0,"After less than two weeks, the gold is peeling off, exposing resin core.<br />It's like wearing costume jewelry."
2.0,"I like the color,  but it fits too tight"
2.0,Collar to pointed . Not like picture shown.
2.0,"Poor quality.  I ordered an XL, it’s huge.  Not even wearable.  Will be returning."
2.0,The post might be stainless steel but the metal around the flower is not and it’s turning my ear green. :(
2.0,Arms are way too tight.
2.0,"Is very pretty, ashes needed patience to be put in.  For the amount of money spent the chain should never have broken.  It broke after about 2 months. The necklace was only worn as intended."
2.0,"Picture shows light blue, I got dark blue instead! I kept them, but I'm not going to order anything else!"
2.0,Poor quality but very cute. Reminds me of something you'd get out of a 50 cent machine.
2.0,The item does not wear as it appears the slights on each side make it more like a long shirt versus a dress
2.0,"The material is OK, but it runs WAY small."
2.0,Nice to have when you want hide money or what ever you need to hide - but (while in Mexico) I found this item to be a bit small to hold paper money<br />and I thought it difficult to remove bills when paying for something. I will still use this but wish it was a bit larger.
2.0,"I absolutely love this anklet, BUT! It’s continues to break on me. I didn’t wear it often, and I’m super disappointed because it’s so pretty. I bought this the first time and assumed the break was my fault. So when I could buy it again, I would be even more careful with it. The second time, I barely wore it, and I owned it for like a month before it broke. I’m super sad about it because I wanted a gold anklet that didn’t turn easily without the hefty price of full gold, hence why I got the gold-filled. I don’t think I will buy this a third time even though it was so pretty. I don’t see the point in paying $10 for the same anklet every month."
2.0,The top of the dress is about 2 sizes smaller than the listed size
2.0,"I am between a medium and large. I ordered a medium and the shirt was slightly too tight, however, what made me return this shirt was how plain it was. It just wasn’t as nice as the photo"
2.0,"Very thin, and not really flattering"
2.0,The bow tie's don't fit my 19.5-20&#34; neck.
2.0,Bought these about 5 months ago and liked it initially. Wore it all the time but within the last month I noticed it changing color to a copper tone.  Now the bracelet it self is all copper and the charms look dull/tarnished.  Have dumped it. You get what you pay for ($12)!!!
2.0,Demasiado grande la talla
2.0,"The shirt is a very pretty green and fits great everywhere except for the arms.  They are so tight, I was able to get the shirt on, but it was basically cutting off the circulation.  Also, there was a spot on the front of the shirt that looked as if there was a tag on the inside (like a shadow) but there was nothing there.  Disappointed because I had really high hopes for this shirt.  I will be returning this."
2.0,One side is huge the other is fairly thin making it uncomfortable for anything but sitting around
2.0,Zipper on the wrong side
2.0,"cheap China knockoffs of actual Kaos and at $10 per 1.  When holding them next to real Kaos Softwear you can feel the difference in thickness and the ""00g"" and Kaos symbol are barely visible at all"
2.0,"I was excited to have this color is good, scent good everything was looking good until it broke...not sure about the quality"
2.0,I bought this for my toddler so he could “wash” dishes with me. His clothes were soaking wet under the apron. So it’s not waterproof like the description says. What a fail. It is cute though and I like the adjustable neck strap.
2.0,Was disappointed product started falling apart in no time
2.0,"item is coming apart after first wash, also item is not large, fits tight."
2.0,I would recommend ordering a size up if you want a loose/comfy fit. Material soft but heavier weight. Definitely winter loungers.
2.0,The fabric is thin and has no give.
2.0,"Well, the shipping was rapid. But the description says 6mm but its not even. When I saw it I was shocked, I didnt know they could make earrings so small! It states that it is 6mm but my friend and I measured it and it was almost (but not even) 5mm. It is only $30.00 and not even worth the hassle of returning. So if you are into very small earrings highly suggested or if you are looking for baby studs another great gift. The shipping though was very fast and effecient."
2.0,"These earrings are adorable, that's not even a question. However, I bought these for my mother for her birthday because I know she'd love them, and she went to put them on, but one had such a bad hinge she couldn't get it open. Now she can't get it to close.<br /><br />I spoke to Amazon and they helped me get a second pair, and I just got them. The second pair also had a faulty earring due to the SAME. EXACT. ISSUE. This one actually could close, but the hinge was so stiff that it's too difficult for my mother to even bother trying to get it in her ear.<br /><br />We both noted that, with the packaging YFN uses, it was the earring that came in its own little bag that had the consistent issues. I don't know why, probably just not the greatest materials.<br /><br />At least she has a functioning, decent pair now that I had to order a second pair to try to fix things for her.<br /><br />Careful with these."
2.0,They are ok for wearing around and maybe light exercising  but not really for running.
2.0,"strange sizing-----pants too long, jacket too fitted."
2.0,"This is a very cute dress. I was really excited to be getting it,then couldn't fit it at all. I got an extra large and it's too small for my daughter who wears a small. There is no give in the material at all. The top of the material is different than the bottom. The top is polyester -cotton blend. I have no idea the type of fabric the bottom is; however it's will look nice on someone."
2.0,"These shoes are not boots they are slippers and they are not made to wear outside.....The slippers is made out of cheap material and they do not look like the picture...... I was very disappointed when I received my package.....The seller however did give me a 60% refund and allow me to keep both pairs of slippers but I would have rather been given a100% refund and return the merchandise to the seller so don’t buy this product if you think you’re getting the boots that looks like the picture, I’m telling you that you’re not. THEY ARE SLIPPERS!!!!"
2.0,"I ordered white and was shipped off-white for the 2nd time.  The arms are very tight, but I'm on a pretty tight deadline and will have to make it work."
2.0,Looks like cheap costume jewelry - which I guess it is based on the price.  To quote my wife &#34;Very Gaudy&#34;.
2.0,"The material is fine, ir is a tight knit cotton that is soft to the touch! The color deep and a conventional black! The fit is strange! The sweater is long! Too long and the sleeves are not banded making way too loose, The sweater buttons in the front the opposite of what I am used to and the buttons do not close the front evenly! I am seriously considering returning it%!"
2.0,Read above commet
2.0,Was think material.  Unflattering. Poor stitching.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, they are really cute, warm and go with my new winter coat.. the only complaint is the little furry ball on one of the gloves is missing some of its bits..and it has a big flat empty spot right on top. Just be aware of this when purchasing these. I was going to return them for new ones..but I really needed gloves at the time... :("
2.0,did not fit well on me.
2.0,Ordered two pairs. Both pairs of collars broke within one week.<br />Company replaced with two new sets without hesitation.<br />Two new sets broke within two weeks of using.<br />Gave two stars for company's cooperation.
2.0,El Cheapo. Used for my emergency always in the car  shades. May not see the case again for months. It will prevent scratches not smashes
2.0,"I'll give it two stars for quality because the quality was decent but the fit is waaaay too large. I know it's supposed to be a more flowy loose dress but I ordered a small in the short sleeve and it felt like I was wearing a sheet, not flattering at all."
2.0,"Somewhat cheap made. A really heavy, scratchy fabric.."
2.0,The sizes did not match the chart at all
2.0,It's cute but way shorter than the picture
2.0,The material is thin and cheap looking. It is stretchy but still too small for its size
2.0,The picture and description said that this was stockings not sleeves!
2.0,"Way too big. I usually wear a size 4/6 pants, size 5 underwear, but in China sizes I tend to be a med or large.  I should have ordered a small"
2.0,Too small. Maybe fit someone with a size 0-5 cloth size.
2.0,Was way too big. I am 140lbs 5’5 and it looked too big. I ended up returning it
2.0,The concept is ideal and I rally liked the ring but the metal alloy caused an allergic reaction within 24 hours.  I can't wear it!
2.0,"They were okay at first, they started looking crappy really fast."
2.0,"I like the fabric the most, as it’s both soft and sturdy.<br />What I like the least is actually two things: they are way too long (over 6 inches too long) AND there is a gap near the waist that is very uncomfortable.<br />I will be returning them and most likely staying with the in-person “try on” process at local stores. I just don’t want the frustration of trial and error multiple times, just for one pair of pants... plus the time factor of how long it could take to find the right fit."
2.0,"I don't know how to explain it. This just doesn't have the compression inlays that I needed. It doesn't really hold shape together very well. It runs smaller than I would have imagined but I guess that's what comes with the territory when you're trying to compress and shape. I just didn't like the way this fit nor did I care for the actual compression of it. It didn't really do much of anything. I even had someone else try it on just to see if it was just me but they said the same thing. It just needs more compression inlay to really hold and compress to reshape excess fat or skin bulge. It didn't do the job, unfortunately."
2.0,Only been wearing it for almost two weeks and the color is already rubbing off. Save your money.
2.0,"too thin, returned it.<br />nice packaging though."
2.0,"My husband needed a watchband that was breathable and really liked this one until less than a month in the pin holding the band on broke, we have extras but this band used a special pin that can't be replaced. Very disappointing"
2.0,So soft but soooo small.
2.0,"It's cute but the newborn size is not actually newborn but 0-3. They are DIFFERENT. The actual outfit is fine quality wise, just way too big for a newborn and mis-labeled as advertised."
2.0,"The material is way too thin for plus size people. It offers no support in the chest area. This is not meant for Renaissance wear if you're trying to be historically accurate. You'd have to wear a bra or corset to get support. The material is almost see-through. For a costume party, you better wear modern support, and a slip. It's a very thin dress that's a pretend Renaissance look."
2.0,Very short in body length and ride up. A little small too (i&#34;m a US size 6)
2.0,Very tiny earrings and not at all appropriate for adults.
2.0,Not at all flattering
2.0,"Good quality, but I was sent the wrong size. If you get the right size, I'm sure they would be great"
2.0,"Very cute, great colors, but then came super squished and flat. I can’t figure out how to fluff them so that they look like the product pictures."
2.0,The seam down the front does not flatter a lady's private bits. Will be tossing this one.
2.0,"Small, looks cheap returned it"
2.0,Sadly it broke while I wore it. Thankfully I was able to catch it before loosing it. The palm tree is still nice but the chain had started to change color. Maybe your not suppose to constantly wear it.
2.0,The metal on this changed colors very quickly. Not the best quality. But not bad for the price.
2.0,Was not the shirt pictured.
2.0,I love the purse so cute but I carried it one day and the butterflies started popping off<br />Very disappointed
2.0,"The fleece top was cute and fit, I ordered a large for the gym but there was a hole in the pocket and within the first wash the string in the hood was out. Not worth the price for what I got."
2.0,"This item is crazy small, I could not even pull it up over my hips. It is also not as nicely made as the one in the picture. The bow was missing, the fabric felt stiff, the lace was not trimmed well where the straps attached, and the front hem went straight across, not the pretty curve as pictured. However, I think the product was what I should have expected based on the price. The customer service from this company was exceptional, far beyond what expected. If you do buy it, make sure to order a minimum of 2-3 sizes up from your normal US sizing."
2.0,"I read all the posts that said order a size larger and I am so confused. I am 5'8&#34; tall and weigh 270 lbs. I generally wear a size 20. With ease and room to insert my memory foam pillow, I could pull these shorts on and up to my armpits...no exaggeration! They are GINORMOUS! I think they are made for shorter,  heavier women. I admit I have muscular legs and carry my weight around the middle, but these were made to fit a &#34;rounder&#34; body type. I say that with love, not criticism. We all hold it in different places ladies! I hope this help someone else. I don't think the shorts were poorly made, just not clear on the sizing."
2.0,"I really loved the look and feel of this hate when I got it.  But it runs small.  Wouldn't fit my head.  Normaly an X-Large hat would fit and be snug, this one wouldn't even go on."
2.0,the cat stencil is rubbing off.
2.0,"this was returned, it runs extremely small, we ordered a XXXL and it was like a med sized hat"
2.0,i have to polish this chain once a week to keep it clean!  I have never had problems with any of my other sterling silver doing this.
2.0,"Fits well and looks good, but you get what you pay for.  The quality is awful.  After a few washes, the materials starts to fray."
2.0,"It is very bulky, like a man's ring and it opens up the fingers and just feels bad. Plus it looks cheap"
2.0,Scarves aren't hemmed-I'm afraid they will fray.  Colors and fabric are nice though.
2.0,"Way too wrinkled, wasn't well put together"
2.0,"Surprisingly sheer (but in fairness, it's too tight in the chest area - I'm a 40/42D), and quite unflattering, primarily due to the placement of the pockets... they're right on the sides of the dress and hit at the hips, making me look even more lumpy and bumpy in that area than I am.  I'd order an XL, but the pocket situation would undoubtedly still be an issue, and it would likely be too long as well (the Large just hits the floor while I'm barefoot).  Disappointing, because I loved the pattern, but it's going back!"
2.0,"I know it's cheap costume jewelry, my daughter bought it fit her little sister, stone came out immediately."
2.0,I asked for women's size and got Missy extra large. The dress is cute but I can't wear.
2.0,"The ring was pretty, fit well and the writing was nice.  But the edges were very sharp and made it so uncomfortable I couldn’t wear it."
2.0,Thoroughly disappointed! Could barely get my legs into it once I got it on it would not zip pass my butt! I am 5'4 165lbs. athletic build I normally wear like 9/10 this jumpsuit runs small!!! I wanted it for a white party but cannot use it...giving it to my daughter who is about 148lbs. Upset!!
2.0,"Abnormally small....almost like for a child.<br />Very cute but even the large for 5’2, 130lbs was way too small."
2.0,I bought them for my 3 yr old grandson. They are made very well but they are not true to size. Very small
2.0,Was very cheap and plastic feel
2.0,"It's cute but made from cut felt. No way to clean it, so I wear it just for looks."
2.0,"The band feels niceand the texture of the rubber is nice, but almost every time I go to unclasp the band the clasp pops off.  No matter how gentle I try to be it pops or because the recesses for the spring pin seem too shallow and not well defined."
2.0,My son loves them... but they are cheaply mAde and arrived slightly tight on him..
2.0,Bought this for my mom fits her wrist which is very small but do sent form well to the shape of small wrists
2.0,"The color matches the photo. The fit is nice and blousy. Unfortunately the material is quite thin,  there was a hole in the sleeve when it arrived, and it shrunk in length a lot when washed in cold water and hung to dry. Not the best choice for your money :("
2.0,"Very cheaply made, doubt it will last six months"
2.0,"Muy livianos, y bonitos, a los 2 meses las patas se pelaron Y se oxidaron no buena inversión. El precio lo dice todo"
2.0,The fringe fell off after first wash
2.0,Ordered a 3X fit like a medium
2.0,It fit everywhere except along the bottom where the lace is. The lace and the stitching that connects the lace to the bottom of the dress are NOT stretchy at all. It is a disappointment for sure.
2.0,broke 3 in the first try. will be small if u have big hands
2.0,"I am a size 16 and I feel like I am at the absolute cusp of people who can fit into these gloves. That being said, these gloves are made fine. There is no issue with the pinky and the stitching is what is expected of cheap costume stitching.<br /><br />To &#34;fix&#34; the pinky looking too long, you need to bunch up the arm piece and put on the hand piece, then pull down to ensure your fingers fill the glove entirely. Then, pull the arm piece down. If you put these on by sliding them down your hand, the pinky will appear to be too long. Even when put on this way, keep in mind that the stitching will form little lumps at the top of the fingers.<br /><br />Are these gloves worth $11? No. But they're okay for a costume."
2.0,Elegant Women's Multi-Row Torsade Fringe White Pearl Bead Chain Bib Necklace was broken when it arrived. Due to not packaging right. They just put it in  bag and sent it. I would like another one if possible if I could. My other product were great. Not able to take a picture right now because of phone problem.
2.0,"The scallops would not stay up on this dress, and I had to return it. Also, the quality of material is not the best."
2.0,I really really liked this badge holder but I've had it not even a week and the part connecting the lanyard to the badge holder came apart. I attempted to put it back together but I can't even get the little metal piece to open up to skip the badge holder back in. No clue how it was connected in the first place
2.0,"I got an XXL and it fit my friend who is a large perfectly, except that it is to way short. Probably would work if you were 5'3&#34; but I am almost 5'7 and it hit calf length."
2.0,just looked cheap.  Material is thin and shows every blemish.  I returned it.
2.0,"This necklace doesn't fall right, the way the chains are attached to the flower makes the flower hang at an angle and you cant tell what it is. Also, after wearing it twice, it broke. You get what you pay for, I guess"
2.0,Cute earrings but the posts are super bendy. They seem to be made out of a really cheap metal that will likely break with more wear.
2.0,"maybe I just expected this to be bigger than it came, but it's smaller than I expected."
2.0,My granddaughter is very small so I thought this would be perfect for her. This bonnet looks like it is for dolls. I will have to keep looking for a bonnet or hat for her. I had to return this.
2.0,I haven't got it yet after waiting for weeks on end. Was really looking forward to gte it because I'm a decent fan of FT. Hopefully it shows up one day or something!
2.0,They look good thooigh the description said these glasses are for woman but they don't look too much for hers use rather that a mans use
2.0,Only useful for leather laces not woven!
2.0,"I ordered a 1/2 size up and the shoe was way too small. size was on the box, but not printed on the shoe itself ????? Returned"
2.0,Leg holes too big.
2.0,"I'm 5' 6&#34; 125 pounds with a 32C.<br /> I bought the light pink suit, it's very very see-through and is not swim material, instead more like spandex. The SQUAD letters can barely be seen and the 'suit' covers none of my bottom front and is essentially a thong back. I reordered it in a black in a medium.[[ASIN:B01I9K7VYK Women's Letter Print Backless One Piece Monokini Bikini (Medium, Pink SQUAD)]]"
2.0,I would not buy again.  The stripes around the arm do not stretch so it constricts movement as too tight this is a design flaw.
2.0,These are adorable but unfortunately I had to return them. The clasp wouldn’t stay closed at all. Very sad because I was excited about these
2.0,Mine don't look like the picture and are much  bigger than normal &#34;huggie&#34; earrings
2.0,The Baseball Mom fell off the first day.  Missing piece and cannot put it back on.
2.0,I just did not like the feel of this material and it was a little too clingy.
2.0,"I initially ordered a bigger cup size based on reviews and measurements, but the cups ended up being HUGE.<br /><br />I ordered a smaller size. The bra fits with the plain back strap, but doesn’t work with the lace racer back. When using the lace backs, the bra doesn’t fit like it does with the plain strap.<br /><br />It’s a great idea, but needs more work so that the different straps can be switched and provide the same support."
2.0,"I returned this dress-- it was too small for me, even though I ordered L (thats the usual size I wear)"
2.0,"The filter wouldn't stay on. Not comfortable at all, still hard to breath."
2.0,Can’t fit my feet in with the orthopedics
2.0,Was WAY bigger than I was expecting
2.0,"Product does not match the picture unfortunately. The one I received did not have the metal barbell but instead had simple knots tied in the cord. This is unfortunate since I was trying to replace one that had broken with an exact duplicate, and this is definitely not that but a cheaper lower quality version. Don't buy based on the picture, you will be disappointed."
2.0,Not as sturdy as I expected..
2.0,The hat pictured is not the hat that I received.  It was not at all what I wanted.
2.0,Glasses are great but the arm broke where it connects to lens
2.0,"The material is very cheap. The look like they are made like UGGS, but, they are an &#34;inexpensive&#34; man made material."
2.0,"Pretty, but much smaller than states & less stretchy than typical sweater styles dresses."
2.0,It was too big my mistake in ordering.I was looking to replace my smaller zipper Vera Bradley Zip Around.
2.0,Nice looking. Granddaughter loved it. Broke after 2 days.
2.0,"I have mixed feelings about this watch band.  It looks nice.  The clasp works well - much better than some other watches I've owned.  I had to remove a couple of links to get it to fit, but it was straightforward, and the items needed to do it - were included - very nice.  Now the downside.  It's heavy - quite heavy, almost annoyingly so.  The real downside is that the battery life on my Blaze went down the toilet.  Instead of about 3-4 days between charges, I was lucky to get two days.  I switched back to the band that came with the watch and the life returned to normal.  I switched it back to the new band - the battery life problem came back.  I like the look, but now I only wear it for dress up occasions.  I did not contact the vendor about this as I intend to keep it, but this was my experience."
2.0,It is a lovely bold bracelet.  The clasp broke the first time I wore it.  I am hoping I can return it for a replacement.
2.0,The material is nice.The fit is weird.Has alot of stretch.The neck area is cut weird.The stitching is terrible.Pass on this one.
2.0,These shoes are so freaking cute but I ordered a size 11 they fit more like a size 9.
2.0,"To be fair, I have big feet.  Can not use these at all, will give to one of my 5th graders.  Cute enough."
2.0,Kinda disappointing.  The chain that came with pendant was not the one pictured.  The chain it came with was cheap looking and ruined the overall look. Sad
2.0,Started giving me a rash after 6 hours
2.0,"They are not what I expected.  Larger than assumed, based on the photo."
2.0,"Sizing is really off - definitely order a size or two bigger. 130lb 5’3” and always a medium but had a hard time getting into this medium. Thin material and shiny fabric, almost looks like silk or satin.. not my cup of tea. Will be returned."
2.0,"they're cute pants and i wish they fit. they are made for short people. I'm 5'-7"" and these are nowhere near long enough for me."
2.0,I’m 5’7 and 200 pounds and I went with the size chart. I’m between sizes. I thought it’d be best to buy a slightly bigger dress than a smaller one. I bought a 3X but should’ve bought a 2X. Buttons look like they were stitched on as part of a home sewing project. Loose threads around the button holes. Material gapes away from my body in the back.
2.0,These shorts were very sheer and you could see straight through.  I bought theses to go kayaking in but would need to wear a long shirt so nobody could see straight through to my undies.
2.0,"These are a good size, but I cannot wear them for more than a few minutes without my ears burning..not good for sensitive skin."
2.0,"Just received this item and I found it to be much too expensive for it's appearance.  It' flat, not dimentional and it looks too animated.  For this price, dice should have some dimension.  Size is good, all other dice I've seen are way too tiny for an adult charm chain."
2.0,"When I ordered the shirt I didn’t realize it would take almost a month to arrive.  Fine, I have other clothes.  Once it arrived I tried the shirt on and there is a big hole along the seam.  What a disappointment.  The fabric and cut of the shirt are fine.  Too bad about the hole."
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this shirt, I love elephants and have been getting into yoga and mandala art, but when it arrived I was so disappointed. The shirt is well made and the design is cute and quality however the shirt definitely runs 1-2 sizes too small despite being labeled as a loose fit cut and the color is very off from the picture. It’s labeled as black but per the product picture I was expecting a heathered black... as you can see from my picture the shirt is grey, appropriate since this is an elephant, but not at all what I wanted or expected. I have a black tank next to it for comparison. The material of the shirt is average, not super soft but not rough, however it is thick, I’d find it heavy and uncomfortable on a hot day."
2.0,"Have you ever heard an old lady's girddle creak as she walks by? I am showing my age by implying I know that sound but these sports bras make that sound and show a bulk under your shirt that may justake people stare trying to figure out "" what's wrong with this picture"" I'd take a picture to show you all but since I started working out because I'm fat....no one wants to see that! Anyhoo, I'm returning the two I didn't try on and who knows maybe after I lose some weight it won't feel like a futuristic bulletproof vest."
2.0,"ribbons are too thin (the picture made it look like they were wide cloth ties like Zorro). Fits nicely, soft cloth lining.  Would be fine for $8, but this cost $20."
2.0,Very disappointed!! I followed the size chart and it is now where close!! We even order up size!! sadly it came the day before our even so we are screwed!!
2.0,Not a 3x. Would fit a 1x possibly a 2x
2.0,"I have had three of these. I kept trying them because they are so beautiful. After about a month, the clasps on every one of these bands comes undone causing the device to drop off my wrist. Luckily, I have found my Fitbit each time, but I am not going to press my luck any longer.  I am still looking for a secure band.  Even the original band breaks off at the base of the device."
2.0,For very small wrist
2.0,No los recomiendo
2.0,"I returned this product as it was too big. The v neck came way to low, showing my bra. It was super wide on the body and arms. When I lifted my arms our you could see in my shirt through the sleeve. I feel like if I were to size down to a medium it would have been to short for me. The material was soft but thicker than I anticipated."
2.0,This runs at least a size too small
2.0,I ordered size L/XL and received size S/M!  When I enquired about the problem with sizing I was told there was only one size!  I was not able to use these socks and it was a waste of money for me!
2.0,Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for
2.0,"I purchased these pants for running and minimalizing what I have to carry in a fanny pack, like my phone and key. However, these pants aren't what I thought they were. They appear to be compression pants with a pocket, what they are, are tights that change the color of your skin or hides your junk, but they do not compress. I purchased the size that was recommended and they did not fit as the abdomen portion of the pants are very long. The waist is cut so that when pulled up properly the waistband is around the bottom of my chest.<br /><br />I rated them as a two-star because the design and the idea is good, but teh follow through was horrible. if one wants them as possible compression pants I would buy them one - two sizes down, but then the inseam and the waist probably wouldn't fit. But if you're looking for something to cover your sternum while you walk around the house using the pocket to keep track of your phone then these are the tights for you.<br /><br />I would not recommend these tights to anyone who is really training hard and wants comfort and actual compression from their compression pants."
2.0,"I received a set of these socks for Christmas and thought they were the coolest socks I had ever see.  The non-slip grip on the ankle is great and the colors are awesome. However, first pair I put on has a hole you can put your pinky finger through, see photo below. I’ve emailed the company with no response and they do not have a phone number. They are beautiful socks but their Quality Assurance needs some adjustments."
2.0,"The material is ok, but the buttons are terrible."
2.0,The top of the dress was really cute but it didn’t hang well at all. It fit like the number 8 proofing out at the pockets instead of hanging nicely.
2.0,Doesn’t fit me at all but if they had a smaller size I’d get the cap cause its a really nice one
2.0,"Way to stretchy!! The bottom isn't stretchy at all after 2 months of use.  So, my boobs just fell out the bottom. Can only wear when home. Disappointed"
2.0,"Does not work with my Fitbit versa 3  -  no way to connect.<br />Color is nice, looks good but I can't use it - will have to give away or return."
2.0,"Was too big for my face.  Nicely made and attractive, but I returned them."
2.0,"Hard to put on. Cute, but not convenient."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:7add5e0785ebfa3ef8c4c5f6065c11ae]] This dress was super tight on my hips that it wouldn’t come down all the way. I got the size 6/L (which is my normal size) but don’t think the size 8/xl will be good bc the bodice was super loose on this as it is. This is made for someone w no hips an big boobs.
2.0,Clasp was broken in the bag
2.0,"I ordered a size up and had to return it because it was too small. I'm usually a solid medium but after reading reviews I ordered a large. It could button and zip but was way too tight. I recommend ordering two sizes up. It's a really cute piece, and I will be reordering a larger size!"
2.0,"Really tight fit. Will make it work for a costume, but the quality is poor for a formal event. The length is shorter than what is shown in the picture."
2.0,"These are just as advertised, they just hurt my ears a lot and I couldn’t sleep with them in 😕 I was just a little disappointed. Quality was good, but very heavy and item was just as described."
2.0,In the picture the underwear part of the swimsuit has a different design and the one I received does not look like that one at all
2.0,"Very pretty scarves, but the navy one came apart the first time I wore it.  It also shed and the pieces got on everything.  So far, the orange one is holding up better, but it, too, sheds and is starting to come apart too.  I would not purchase these again."
2.0,Broke in two weeks
2.0,"I loved all the different colors and shapes that these socks came in. The first pair I wore was perfect, they were super comfortable and fit great. The next day when I went to try on the Black & White pair I found them to be extremely tight and uncomfortable due to the way they were constructed. The black thread gets caught on your toes when you try to put them on and once you get them past your toes trying to get them around my heel was also very difficult. It sounded like I had to break half the threads to put them fully on.<br /><br />I have not tried them all on at this point but as of now there are two pairs that I can not wear, the colored socks that I have worn have been great and I am very happy that I purchased them. But overall I am disappointed that there wasn't better care in how all of them were constructed."
2.0,There were so many good reviews so I had high expectations. This dress is more like a beach cover up. Totally see through. Very thin. Disappointed!!!
2.0,The jacket seems comfortable and it looked good on my boyfriend. However there was a huge slit in the neck region and several threads were coming off. So returning it now. Shall buy one more to see if I get a better quality one.
2.0,5'11 and 180 lbs... dress was not long enough and the top of the dress has cheap looking material
2.0,The cups are too big. Overall looks a little old ladish.
2.0,"Not as pretty in person, sleeve ruffle falls oddly over the shoulder."
2.0,"The shirt is cute, but didn’t fit well. The sleeves are really tight and feel awkward."
2.0,the edges are already cracking showing white.
2.0,"Wanted to like this watch, but hands too difficult to see."
2.0,"Doesn't cover at all, as soon as you move your chest is exposed."
2.0,I've never worn padded bike pants but I did expect a large and odd feeling pad. The pad sticks out about a 1/4 inch from the back making it very hard to even wear anything over them without seeing the shape of the back of the pad. It is also so wide that it rubs on my thighs. I could understand if I was a tiny person (size 10) but to be so large and stick out from the back seems to be very poorly made. I am suprised that I didn't not read about that in any reviews.
2.0,They are huge and I cannot wear them
2.0,I’ve worn them twice and the seams at the wrist have come apart. They also do not work as touchscreen gloves. The fit is great and if the seams hadn’t split the. I wouldn’t even care about the touchscreen not working.
2.0,"I'm someone who has worn large for most of my adult life but I've lifted weights the last couple years and large fits really snug on me now. Therefore, I ordered this in an extra large. I'm dwarfed by it. It's not just too long but it's super wide also. I'm 5'10"" 180lbs. It's so huge, I might even need a medium."
2.0,I do not like having to constantly tug the elastic waist into place.
2.0,I don’t like the quality of the material and I’m pretty sure it doesn’t last long. It’s also really hard to take them off.
2.0,Clip on outside broke off in less than 90 days and sleeves inside were torn away from inside. Still tried to make it work without sleeves but soon after clip broke off. Not worth $20 for such a short life span of product. Wish it would have lasted longer I kinda liked it at first.
2.0,This is a flimsy little piece of material and it is too loose to wear as a headband.
2.0,Some of the elastic is trying to come out already
2.0,thin cheapish t-shirt material
2.0,"I returned this because it didn't look as glamorous as the photo and I found the fitting a bit ""floppy""."
2.0,No tag to tell which is front or back
2.0,"This product may be a good fit for someone with a small cup that does not do heavy impact activity. Colors are beautiful and price is amazing but if you need a lot of support during activities such as running, I would definitely not buy this product. I run long distance and have a 34DDD cup size. I had to stop after half a mile and go change my bra. I was really hoping this product would support  me but it seems that I will have to go back to buying $60 Victoria’s Secret supportive sports bras."
2.0,"Pretty, but too heavy and not real sterling. Returned."
2.0,"It does hold my iPhone 11 Pro Max, however, while putting it on the first time I ripped the center mesh due to my chest size being bigger than capacity. I ordered the same size as every other sports bra I own and wear with no problem, we will see how long it holds up with the torn mesh. Otherwise I would be pretty happy with it."
2.0,"returned...was not right size, says made bigger. is not made bigger in size. if you wear xl order xl."
2.0,"The fabric is very, very thin. I purchased this as a fall transitional piece and it's unfortunately not going to work. I'm erring on the side of buying something more expensive, but of higher quality, from somewhere like Ann Taylor or Nordstrom instead. Returning it."
2.0,This is only to be worn if you have a narrow midriff.  It squashed my breasts and I returned it.
2.0,I didn't expect much from this watch given the price but it's even worse than I anticipated. Severe tarnishing after only a month of sporadic wear. The bling is real though.
2.0,"The legs are like four inches past the end of my toes- and I am 5’7. The pants are see through on my butt, and the jacket is super tiny! Unfortunately will return."
2.0,Material ripped too easy
2.0,pretty large
2.0,I'm 5'7&#34; and this was NOT tunic length on me at all!  If it was longer I would have loved it.  I like the style and the teal heather color.  But I have to send it back sadly.
2.0,i wasn’t happy with it
2.0,"Product was very skimpy although fabric was nice. Might have fit as an extra large, but definitely not a 2X. It was 3.5 inches shorter than other 2X shirts."
2.0,"Do not order the size you are....go up at least 3 sizes!!!! Item returned, credit received."
2.0,"I don't wear any of these really. I don't have thick lobes, and I still can't screw the backs on. It's like they aren't aligned right or something. They are beautiful and the gems haven't fallen out. I'll wear them on special occasions, but without a back. So I always worry they'll fall out. If you're looking for something cheap and you won't use them daily these might be ok, but I definitely can't use them daily."
2.0,Very large and looks more like a tent than tunic.
2.0,"I returned these for two reasons.<br />1)  There was a seem across the top of the cargo pockets that pulled in against my legs.<br />2)  There were not enough belt loops, once you get past a size 34 you need more that 5 belt loops if you carry a lot of gear like I do."
2.0,"These are not what I thought I ordered. They are simple cutouts, the straps are WAY thinner and plain. In the picture, it shows a mask with raised border and nose extending out, the straps are the same height as the mask and get thinner as they end.<br /><br /> The masked I got was not like this at all and I cannot use it for what I intended it for. Let alone it comes with 6 of these cutouts. The only reason why I don't give this a 1 star is that the quality feels decent enough. Which is why I put 2."
2.0,Not as sturdy as I would have liked....
2.0,"This wallet is pretty puffy! I'm looking for a thin wallet I can stuff in my front pants pocket. This is too puffy by itself. WIth a few cards and money, it was way too big."
2.0,I have skinny ankles and these bunch alot at the bottom.
2.0,"Every time I order clothing off of Amazon, it is always too small. I use the size chart and read reviews and do everything. I have gone one size and two sizes up and still its too small. The sizes are not standardized and not consistent. Its very very frustrating and disappointing."
2.0,"Belt was pretty, but showed up with rhinestones missing and some loose in the box. Belt in it's delicate state should be wrapped up at least, but was just in a box loose to be bumped around. Unfortunately had to return."
2.0,"I should've measured my current one, this one is too large, width is fine but it is too tall to fit normally in a regular trifold wallet.  Also, the no return policy is not great, I rarely even look because normally you can return stuff on Amazon, but this is an exception and it isn't well marked on the page, imo.  If the size works for you and you don't care about the no returns policy, these might be fine."
2.0,Chain broke as soon as I got it.
2.0,"This product Best feature is the ban doesn’t cause discomfort or sweating.<br /><br />WORST part of this product it doesn’t stay connected. 1side or the other will disconnect from the main part, causing it to fall off. Which if not caught can cause the fitbit to disfunction 😡"
2.0,"This dress was super cute, but runs WAY TOO SMALL. I could barely fit my arm in the Large and I normally wear a medium in everything. Plus, the material was a bit scratchy so I sent it back. Nope."
2.0,"Terrible quality. Seams coming apart after one wear. Cute, but don’t expect them to last."
2.0,I know it is cheap...but looks VERY cheap.  I won't wear or give as a gift.
2.0,Thin material.  The color is a light maroon and does not look like the picture.  Returned item.
2.0,"I wanted this to work, but it didn't. Bottoms are made as expected but the tops are so small it seems defective! Now if you have an apple bottom and a bite up top, this might work for you! Oh, your torso might need to be short too."
2.0,"Pretty cheap, you get what you paid for."
2.0,"Cute with a lot of potential. Fabric seems like some sort of thick linen blend,  but 100% is not corduroy or anything close to it. Very tight across the shoulders and upper arms. If I button this I can't raise my arms. Hopeful I can make this work."
2.0,"This was incredible small and the bottom is really really cheeky. It won't be flattering if you have big boobs because theyll just be hanging out and there isnt much support, but if you're flat chested you'll be able to pull it off.<br /><br />The color bled like crazy in the wash even though I tried to handwash it beforehand, so beware. Ended up ruining a few other items I had in the washer."
2.0,I love these sandals but I sat in the sun and set the sandals next to me for about an hour and they shrunk a full shoe size.
2.0,I’m 5’6 and 160 and the large wouldn’t zip.
2.0,"Thought it was going to be flowy, it was more like a nightshirt"
2.0,After washing the shirt was close to a 12mo size.
2.0,When I received the item it looked tarnished.  Not a good buy at all
2.0,Not comfortable. Fit is too tight. Not even sure it would fit a child.
2.0,Ordered this for my husband for Christmas but returned it due to low quality.  It was not a high quality leather & it had a bad smell to it.  I returned it with free return shipping.
2.0,"The sizing is way off. The waist was too big, but the hips were too narrow. I gave it away."
2.0,"If this purse was a person they would be a green Donald Trump. Thought it was cute, but nope. If you like ugly things, but it!"
2.0,"The style and shape are fine, but the color is  definitely NOT yellow and red... they are yellow and PINK... absolutely not what i wanted or needed to match with my red dress. Really disappointed."
2.0,Super cheap straps broke first wear 10 minutes in .
2.0,These were way too shear and just overall were a disappointment. Wouldn’t purchase again. Would recommend those who do purchase to size up.
2.0,Band look real cheap and feel cheap also and the rose gold don't match the watch
2.0,Incredibly small and with the lettering it's illegible.  Toooo Small
2.0,Horrible crease marks and peeling on clear plastic after one days wear
2.0,Flimsy material. Extremely thin. Not at all what I expected. Very dissatisfied.
2.0,Too small and it doesn't look quite like the picture.
2.0,"We purchased this for family photos in a 0-3 month size. What arrived fit more like a 3-6 month. other than that, the clothes look cute and all came together. We will keep it for our son to grow into."
2.0,This sizing was pretty true to size but I didn't love the way this shaper felt on me. It's going back.
2.0,Came with a gaping hole in the side fabric. Seemed like decent quality for what I paid but a major disappointment as a gift to my girl and it comes ripped. Poor quality control
2.0,The rose feels barely attached i wouldnt feel comfortable wearing it everyday or even for a few hours without having another one with me due to it feeling as tho it would break. and when I was cleaning it the color was coming off which made me not want to wear it.
2.0,"Coat is very heavy, black rubs off on my neck and wrist, middle button fell off in 2 days of wear. Only good thing is it's warm."
2.0,Very cute Daisy. Will not stay fastened. Needs a better fastener. I will have to buy a better tack pin back.
2.0,"This apron arrived and seamed durable leather. Unfortunately, with very minor work use the leather has ripped about a two inch tear in the side.<br />  Attempting contact with manufacturer but out of return window. Will update with outcome."
2.0,A little pricey for the guilty. Expected better material.
2.0,"I did not like the material of this shirt for everyday wear. Too shiny, better used for work out gear."
2.0,"The length of the shirt and sleeves were too short. The size was not true-to-size...much smaller, but the style is nice. If purchasing, buy one or two sizes larger."
2.0,These socks are very hot. Good compression but the.material doesn't breath well so they are just hot!
2.0,The price is cheap because the quality is cheap. Only 1 or 2 were actually cute enough to wear.
2.0,these were huge especially around the calf/shin...had to return these
2.0,The pants have a nice design. I enjoyed that the pockets are in the front but the fabric is super cheap.
2.0,I like the color and the softness of the jacket. I ordered cause I liked the shape of the jacket. It is just a plain ole jacket. I ordered 3 sizes up and I should of went up 4 or 5.
2.0,Don’t know yet as it’s a gift
2.0,Theses are both the same size as you can see the black ones that I just ordered are much larger than the blue one I ordered a few months ago.
2.0,"I'm a small, but this was so tight, and the fabrics has no give, poor quality. Nice and bright colors."
2.0,Much baggier than I expected.
2.0,"These shoes no doubt are excellent. They look great when advertised however it seems i got the last pair left and although the packaging was good and shipping very fast, when i received them they were stripping anf the decorations on the from falling off. I am dissapointed as they were intended to be worn for a special occasion and they would have matched my handbag as well."
2.0,"Go to Claire's, 13$ for earrings that aren't even the size of my daughters pinky nail foh"
2.0,"Gave it 3 stars, because it would be cute if I had a longer torso (or stood with my arms above my head) to support it.  I am 5'4, 130lbs and this WAS NOT the bathing suit for me.  Side boob, extra fabric on the torso were the reason it was sent back.  This seems to be made for a specific body type (which I do not own)!"
2.0,The quality is average and a bit smaller than I expected.
2.0,"Looked amazing and beautiful, but one &#34;house&#34; plastic gem fell off and the bracelet broke in half.<br /><br />This is my this day wearing it. hoping to get a full refund."
2.0,I didn't get it and no money back or anything
2.0,"I usually wear mediums 6’2”, 170 lbs., 32-33 waist and they will not stay up on my waist.  HUGE."
2.0,"These are not expensive leggings so I feel like I can't be too disappointed. However, every time I look at these I think about how I could have taken that same amount of money and purchased a much nicer pair for the same price from TJ Maxx or Marshall's or even Nordstrom's Rack. They are very thin and poorly made and I don't think they look like the photo at all. First of all, the waist is an elastic band which is just, yuck. Second, the color is a much lighter blue. I realize they always have the disclaimer that ""color may vary from photo"" but it's not even close to navy in color and the constellations were more of a pastel yellow. Overall, a huge disappointment. I will be cutting these up to use as rags since they are fairly worthless as clothing."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:7785b5ea58ff74528d3d2f1ce924e5ce]] Wanted to love but they come off VERY easily for my toddler.  The straps fit on his miraflex glasses, but are so easy to pop or pull off for little ones.  One strap popped off on its own just after connecting :("
2.0,At first wash looks like old ones
2.0,There are some similar to these on Amazon but by a different brand that are much much better
2.0,Cute but they broke the first time I took them off.
2.0,"Quality of fabric doesn't work well with the design, makes me look pregnant."
2.0,Definitely does not look like the picture! Very cheaply put together. I would not buy it again.
2.0,This bracelet tarnished almost immediately.  I was wearing this everyday & just didn't hold up.
2.0,"It first confused me, but then I realized, its screws into your ears and each part screws apart, they are really difficult to put in. Also mine fell out throughout the day then finally I lost them."
2.0,The item is not brown it is more of a burgundy color. The thin ones are also round which you can not tell in the picture.
2.0,It didn't stretch very well and felt stiff. It was also a lighter color than what I was expecting/saw. I definitely won't be wearing this dress unfortunately :(
2.0,Very cheaply made skip and get the metal screw ones!
2.0,"I found this very difficult to walk in!  The fit itself was great, but it was too tight around the knees, making it difficult to walk in."
2.0,These are way too small to be septum rings unless you have the nose of a baby.
2.0,could not use them
2.0,"I purchased the right size; however, they were too tight.  I believe their compression ratio is wayyyy off on these.  I returned them.  I needed light compression.  I couldn't even get these past my toes."
2.0,I did not know the holes were going to be so small .. cannot find rivet to fit it
2.0,"It fits as expected, but it has an odd fit to it? I have a more boxy body type, and it wasn't flattering."
2.0,Faded after about 5 times swimming.
2.0,"Poorly made. The Prayer, words, imprint wore off very quickly. Embossing is cheap, not lasting."
2.0,Very poor quality material.  Pin on back is not long enough to lock properly and secure the brooch.  Chain necklace is extremely short.
2.0,Wasn’t flattering on me.
2.0,"One washing, didn't even wear them yet and they came out looking like crap,plus the foot part shrank and the rest didn't but just look like they're old worn out socks"
2.0,I purchased a medium. Im normally a 6. I can' wear 4-8 depending on brand. I'm going to try for a small. Maybe an extra small. Color is nice. Lots of stretch. But huge.
2.0,Runs small in my opinion and looks cheaply made..however it was a gift for a 13 year old girl who loved it so much she couldn't bare the idea of returning it.
2.0,These don’t stick very well.
2.0,arrived broken lol. but at least they refunded my money....i’m pretty disappointed and sad still
2.0,"The charms were very cute, just what I was looking for. The bracelet itself looked cheap. I ended up pulling the charms off and putting them on a Keychain."
2.0,The studs are too long and does not fit. Falls forward. Do not remember unless you want to cut & rethread.
2.0,"I am not satisfied with the quality, they are very cheaply made and creek when you open them to put them on.  The glasses don't fit in the case, and the case is not black and white it is silver and black,,,yuck!"
2.0,"Band has 2 bamds with magnets. The last one I ordered was better with just one. This is not only hard to get on ones wrist, it is uncomfortable."
2.0,"Soft, well made and good color. A little small. But the worst was the zipper. It does not function well and it is on the wrong side. Returning."
2.0,This product is between 1/2 and 2/3 the thickness of the strap make by Yakima and nowhere near as durable.  It broke after the 2nd use.
2.0,This suit has great potential but way too baloony in the chest.  Granted I am a 34b which is small but you have to have a D to fill these cups.  Too bad because I ordered a large which fit my 5'6&#34; frame perfectly in every other area.  I returned  it.
2.0,The color was much more mint green than I expected. I am 5'5&#34; 135 lbs and it was way too short on me. It only came to my ankles. Material was thinner than I expected. I am going to return it
2.0,The earrings post were bent. I am able to bend them upwards but now I risk them being weak and breaking
2.0,"This product has a mirrored lens which is a rose gold color and very reflective. This was not in the description when I purchased them. A little too much reflection for me, and gives a very aggressive look to the sunglasses overall."
2.0,Product fit too big on me.
2.0,"These don't last long.  Other gloves I've purchased can be reused several times, but not these ones."
2.0,thin material used
2.0,They twist up and don’t stay put. I’ve already upgraded to fabric ones.
2.0,Way to small for men’s glasses
2.0,Quality material but the 10-12 year old xl was 2 feet too short not even close for my 9 year old
2.0,Not a fan. Material was ok but even the large was extremely tight. Buy way up.
2.0,"This is great if you don't mind folding your bills. It's well-made, but I wish it were a bit wider. I returned this item."
2.0,"Itchy socks.  Warm socks, but I have to apply Benadryl cream to my ankles or they itch me."
2.0,The fabric was see-through and felt cheap. It didn’t look right on me. I returned it.
2.0,The picture shown is not the same size as the evil eye.  Way too small.  Good for a child too wear.  Not an adult
2.0,I received this band on Saturday Jan 15th and it's already broken! The clasp broke yesterday which is disappointing. I like this band and it's ease to install and adjust. I will order a replacement due to the defectiveness.
2.0,Most of these broke the first time I wore them. Cheaply made. The tiger one was great but slightly too small for my ear. Not worth the purchase.
2.0,"Shoes were bent up as If my daughter wore them and they were too large, horrible quality, really disappointed with Bebe"
2.0,The color wasn't what was displayed in the picture and the stretch was nonexistent
2.0,Magnifying glass is not between two halves it is only covered on one side so it can get scratched and jewelry and chain were cheap and caught on clothing. I thought I still might wear it but only with things it wont snag like casual clothes that have pockets for my glasses. The snag factor rules it out for w dressy clothes which was what I was planning to wear it with.
2.0,"The fabric is very poor quality, but it does look exactly like the picture. It’s also super thin and itchy. Also, sizing is off by two. I’m 5’2”, 130lbs and usually wear a small; I ordered a large and it fits comfortably. Probably going to return. Definitely not worth $27."
2.0,"Made poorly, ripped near zipper,  never got to wear it"
2.0,"Came without an earring pin, can be fixed though, its cute"
2.0,Broke after my first use.
2.0,"I like the bag. It's just a little sloppy. It's large - can hold a lot - but when I set it down anywhere it kind of just collapses on itself. The shoulder strap is great but combined with the handles, the bag is just so messy-looking. The inside lining is kind of rayon and it is unraveling and totally coming apart. I've only had this bag a few months."
2.0,This blazer was just okay looking. Iy also did not fit me well. Many times blazers are worn open and buttoned in the front but this was obviouy too small. Did not work for me.
2.0,The pendant is too small for good detail and because of this it has sharp edges all the way around. I will never wear. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Cool concept and design. So poorly executed. The lens is not anchored on the bottom at all, easily snaggable aka breakable. Bummed because the design is really proportional and the polarization is as promised."
2.0,My son wore these for about a month or two before the shoe started falling apart. His sketchers usually last him 9 months. Good price and I like the strap but I won't be buying these again.
2.0,The pack came with only one Item. Other than that one of the twins was happy.
2.0,poor quality but still looked okay
2.0,They are smaller than I thought an they are not Rose Gold. Just Gold. I am Disappointed
2.0,I’m 208lbs 5’9 I got a 2x and the top fit like a extra small
2.0,"Not great.. just kind of meh.. fabric is very soft but kinda looks cheap, the sleeves are wide and weird, and it’s a little big."
2.0,I'd love this skirt if the elastic at the waist wasn't so tiny.  It is extremely tight and uncomfortable.  I keep thinking it will stretch a bit but not yet.  It is a medium and I usually wear small to medium.
2.0,"they look gorgeous but they are not very good quality, I am on my second pair already and one of the hooks is broken again"
2.0,"This shirt is not only smaller than a standard sized, it is shorter than advertised, the fit is off & the colors are not crisp as shown."
2.0,Luggage looks great for the price however the biggest piece was wet on outside and inside. The shipping box was completely dry - so must've been wet when shipped. Was so wet that the color was coming off on large plastic tag attached to it. The inside of the front zip pockets were wet too. Seriously disappointed.
2.0,Too cheap looking and feeling. I donated to Goodwill.
2.0,I just open the package and 3 rocks fell off !
2.0,Received the package in a timely manner. Not crazy about the head bands.
2.0,Didn't fit right and material was itchy.
2.0,"I wear a 6.5-7” bracelet. I wear a small in watch bands and this scrunchy is very uncomfortable and tight! Tried stretching it out and nothing worked. I wear scrunchies and ponytails everyday on my wrist. But this I can not wear. I just put it on to take a picture for this review, and it has already put marks on my wrist. WAY TO TIGHT!!!"
2.0,I am allergic to the metal and the color was not a true gold color  so did not look good solid  metal
2.0,The fit was good for 2 western style hats. These boxes are ok for storage at home. The materials are to flimsy for travel. I ordered 3 and had 2 delivered in useable condition. The third one was almost cracked in two during shipping. This is why I don't plan to use this hat can for travel. I have some that are made in America that are made better.
2.0,"I have a 7.5"" wrist so I ordered an 8"" set. Still tight. Hope that it will fit well later after I break it in. Not anyone's fault,... just did not want to return it because I took a shower with one of them. LOL!"
2.0,Good idea but the tips are extremely soft and bend easily. Broke after the first use.  Returned for refund.
2.0,"It's not very well made. Been wearing it a day or two a week for a few months, and the hole i use is already stretched halfway to the next one. Buckles are also wearing badly. Can't recommend."
2.0,Didn't fit!!!
2.0,I returned the product. Broken straps and obviously not made for bigger than a b cup!
2.0,Very low quality in both stitching & material. First pair I took out the stitching was already coming apart.
2.0,Super cheap. The leg and arm pieces broke before they could be out on 😔
2.0,They were comfortable but too large with no belt loops. The material isnt what i expected.
2.0,The color is way brighter more yellow in person and the material is kind of garbage.
2.0,"It is a good thing I plan on using this dress as a shirt because the picture is deceiving, I will be lucky that it covers my buttocks"
2.0,I had this watch for about 3 weeks and the battery went dead.  Trying to change the battery is tricky.<br />Pry the back off and you will see a plastic frame over the battery.  BE EXTREMELY  CAREFUL.<br />When you pull it off the entire inside of the clock mechanism can come  out of the watch.<br />This will cause the hands to also come off as they are too large for the hole.<br />Now the watch is ruined or you have to figure out how to put the hands back on.<br />A watch shop could probably help with this.<br />Great watch - poor construction.
2.0,"Material not as expected - shiny rayon / polyester blend, no cotton."
2.0,Runs small and faded after one wash. Waste of money.
2.0,I loved the look of this watch. Unfortunately the dial adjustment broke off a month after the free return option.
2.0,Color is more pink/purple
2.0,I was gifted this and I was really excited to see it.  But it wouldn't lay flat on my collar bone and it stuck out way too far to be even close to flattering.  I think you have to have a neck the size of a child for this to look even mildly flattering.
2.0,Shoulder strap too short quality not to inpressed return!
2.0,These are cute earrings. However they caused major irritation to my earlobes. Normally I can tolerate anything and don’t need hypoallergenic earrings but for some reason these cause infection with repeated wear in my ears
2.0,"Pretty item initially however, within a week it broke apart and discolored to a copper hue."
2.0,Not impressed. I'm going to use it because it's better than what I have at the moment --nothing. It's all bent out of shape and doesn't hang well at all.
2.0,"Very small, I don't have a large head by any means, and these things didn't fit. Perfect for children, not for adults."
2.0,"It was a little big, but the biggest problem was the cut. It cut right below the bust rather than the midsection, like how it looks in the picture."
2.0,Only a dress if you are 5' nothing. It's cute though...
2.0,Not for protection. Very thin Mesh fabric. You can see through them.
2.0,"I bought these for my 3 year old daughter. They are cute shoes, but unfortunately rubbed the heels of her feet raw after wearing a short time."
2.0,"The leakproof liner does not stretch at all, making them run small."
2.0,"Meh, kind of cheap-looking, and the waist isn’t high like the empire style in the photo, but low at the waist (hint: it would be much cuter if the waist was higher like in the photo)"
2.0,The top is very thin. Totally see through.
2.0,Was way smaller had to give it to a tween
2.0,"Finding hiking pants is as difficult as buying jeans and just as disheartening.  I was not even sure how to answer the question how does it fit because what I have come to &#34;expect&#34; is that hiking pants are going to fit weird.  This was no exception.  It was huge in the waist and hips, but tight in the legs - so does that make it too big or too small?  I am sure there is a figure out there that these pants will work with but it isn't mine.  And BTW the hips is where clothes are usually tight on me."
2.0,The paper money slot is too small and you have to work to get bills to fit.
2.0,When I ordered this I was kind of excited because I needed to throw out my old black cardigan. It looked very baggy on the model so I ordered a size up. It came back with this very odd feeling to it. It ran very small definitely not baggy. I can't get over the weird cotton feeling for whatever that material is. Not for me but could be for you I guess.
2.0,They fit strangely. I do not get any &#34;lift&#34; at all.  The material they are made of is fine but I haven't worn them a lot. I won't be purchasing any simular item like this. I will just wear underwire bras on the days I can.
2.0,not very cute and hangs weird
2.0,"The arms are tight but the waist is huge. Would be great as a maternity dress. Since I’m not pregnant, didn’t want to look like I was. Returned the dress."
2.0,"Less than two months of wear, and two giant ragged holes have appeared inside the shoes, under the ball of the foot. Uncomfortable and unwearable. Terrible quality.  But very cute and the light up feature works great."
2.0,Very happy with this shirt - UNTIL we realized there were only 48 stars on the flag!<br />Unacceptable for our country’s flag - I wanted to be proud to wear this shirt.<br />Should not print a false design and sell a bogus product.
2.0,Fits but is poorly made with cheap scratchy fabric. Wish I didn’t buy it
2.0,Not impressed with quality or sizing. Will no purchase again.
2.0,Cheap metal never worn
2.0,I find it difficult to get off and since it is not very stretchy. I am keeping it but may never use it.
2.0,Material is cheaply made and runs too small. Bought a 2 X and it looks like a large. Don't waste your money!
2.0,I have an average size head this visor slips down over my eyes. it is a a nuisance especially since I wear bi-focal glasses
2.0,"The band itself is beautiful, well worth the money for the quality of the band. The problem is that the loops that hold the excess strap are too big and doesn’t stay in place."
2.0,"Returned it same day. It seems a good quality, good material. Fits just too too small. If you are M, order XL."
2.0,Turned my daughter’s finger green.
2.0,this dress was very disappointing as it felt like a costume one size fits all- not at all flattering
2.0,They are not true to size. Should have gotten bigger and they don’t help my disabled husband cause still slips.
2.0,This only fits small kids. Would not fit a 10 year old
2.0,Didn't lay nicely or fit well. Really not flattering in person. Had to return it. :(
2.0,Not what it looks like
2.0,It didn't fit to well and was really tight
2.0,I will like to send it back
2.0,look cool- hard as s*** to put on.. so I cut the top off mine and had a cobbler stitch a strip of leather liner over.. wjoever designs these things in australia has mud between the ears.. they are made in china.. but reall they need a zipper on the side of the tube so you can get them on.. fit is a bit small.  but you can make them work with a pair of scissors.
2.0,"Terrible material, would bot recommend"
2.0,"I ordered a size 10, my normal size 91/2 -10, but was too small. I had hard time getting on and fit tight. Returned item for same thing but size 11. Received today and could not even get them on. Don't know what size they shipped as box was in Chinese. Am returning and not reordering as I have no idea what size to get."
2.0,This product is useful but We bought it for an iguana when it arrived it looks like it's for holding and eagle. It reminds me of a baseball glove mixed with boxing gloves and them long yellow rubber gloves.
2.0,Nice fit and color.  The problem is the top of the lace rolls over (this can be fixed by tacking down) if you have a bust (38DD).  Waist fit and has beautiful lace but needs a matching background.  I returned as the one I received had deodorant marks and looks like it had been worn long enough that the lace was bent over.
2.0,The pants have a pocket on one side only. I think that is just weird.
2.0,This item has no shape. No shape to the dress at all.
2.0,"The boots look very cheap, so disappointed"
2.0,bad experience cheap clothes .color faid
2.0,Did not fit . Had to return. Not as described.
2.0,I was pretty disappointed with these extenders. I have purchased other brands in the past and expected these to work in the same fashion. Unfortunately these were a let down. The elastic in the middle stretches too much and makes your bra ride up. The hooks do not work well and come undone as you are trying to close your bra behind your back. These are meant to be removable so that you can exchange them between bras but they kept coming undone so I got frustrated and closed the hooks by biting them down so that they do not come off my bras. I am not a fan of hooking in front and rotating it back but they may work for someone who puts their bra on that way. If you have never purchased any other kind of extender these might be a godsend because they do help with making clothes more comfortable but unfortunately these are not the best quality.
2.0,I am very disappointed with the hat. It is not the one I put in my bag and paid $16 but the one that costs $5.99. Why should I have paid $16 for $6 product?<br /><br />Please compare:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JJ1OJI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Infant-Toddler-Handmade-Crochet-flowers/dp/B0085IK7R0/ref=pd_sbs_a_3
2.0,I ordered an XL the shirt felt more like a 2x but the pants felt like a medium the material was paper thin so it wasn’t the best quality.
2.0,"Changing my review, 1st it was so so cute but im 2 hours around my ankle was bpack and i tried to upload a picture but Amazon didnt kind of accept it. So its up to you !"
2.0,Small and long in the waist-(Can pull all the way to the bottom of my bra)  Fit on the legs around the thighs big. Quality sucky fabric. I will not buy again. Strange fit….
2.0,Very pretty but runs small.
2.0,My mom who is 5/3 got this dress and it was too short for her and the waist seam was too high.  Overall very odd fit.  Especially since my mom is short for a maxi dress to be short on her is odd.  Though I did warn her to buy something liek this on Amazon is quite a gamble...quality sub par.
2.0,"It was cute but based on their measurements, way too large! I returned it."
2.0,Quality is good but size is not.  Either I made a mistake in ordering or this 36 is about 2 1/2 inches shorter than other belts I have of the same nominal size.  I can barely get to the first hole.  Maybe they shipped the wrong size.
2.0,"Purchased the white dress, very fine fabric and see through, not particularly flattering either.  Returning."
2.0,"Within a couple weeks, the stitching that holds the zipper in place pulled loose.  All of the cards slots are centered and causes the wallet to buldge in the middle putting stress on the stitching.  Poor design."
2.0,They wear out fast.  Not worth the $
2.0,Fell out of my ear on the second wear. Wouldn’t rebuy. They are pretty though
2.0,Don't wash it. The shirt bled in cold water.
2.0,top to smal and bottom stretched out
2.0,Nightgown was not correct size sent. It came to me smaller that what requested. Baby liked so I kept the item.<br />Not happy with purchase.
2.0,They slid down to my daughter ankles right away but she does have pretty chubby legs
2.0,Awful material.  Did not like it.
2.0,"I wanted to like these so badly, but they are not at all waterproof. The style is great and easy for my 5-year-old to slip on himself (we have the red pair with elastics), but they are soaked-through after any time playing outside and they take a long time to dry out. On the other hand, they are cozy and warm, so they might be good winter school shoes, but not for outdoor activities or play.<br /><br />I usually try and see the best in things, but am giving this shoe a 2-star rating as I feel like “waterproof” is false advertising. This is especially disappointing at a $40 price-point :("
2.0,The elastic strap from the back it’s too loose on one the other is just fine
2.0,"I don't like it, because it too small for my frame.  I measure my glasses but still too small"
2.0,Ordered my daughter's a 14/16 and they looked like toddler shorts
2.0,"These earrings are adorable but I was disappointed with the quality. The backs are lose and they are too long to fit comfortably into anyone's ears, let alone a childs! We were able to cut the earrings with a jewelry tool we happened to already have and we have been using alternate backings. Other wise I  would have sent these earring back.  My sensitive skinned daughter hasn't had a reaction to the earrings yet but it's only been 3 days of wear so we will have to wait and see what happens.  Would not recommend these."
2.0,"I had to return this dress because the stripes were not horizontal across the skirt top, which made it look a bit odd.  The material was similar to a high school play costume.  Overall the effect was that I was auditioning for a role as a Disney character.  Not my cup of tea, but may be perfect for someone else."
2.0,"Though these capris fit, they were longer on me than the llustrations suggested. I'm a short gal, and the two pairs of the same brand I bought in the past were just right. I'm either going to have to return these or pay for alteration."
2.0,"I ordered the size of pants I usually order, but these run larger than normal.  Be sure to check out the measurements for each size.  These are nice knit pants, but the size I ordred was way to big on me."
2.0,This bra doesn’t unzip all the way it was difficult to get on and off.  You actually have to put it on and off over your head.  It seemed to be well constructed but not practical.  I returned it
2.0,"Just received this product today, the seam on the inside with  the satin lining has already came loose and I've only had it on my head twice in less than 8 hours."
2.0,I have ordered and used this item for years.  This particular order had several rolls of tape that were unuseable.  You could not remove the backing or the backing was on the roll backward.  I did not know about this problem until I opened the individual rolls.
2.0,short and didn't even cover all of the palm of the 13yr old using it not too mention the fingers were short as well
2.0,"Extremely fast delivery, but quality of custom personalized logo on ball very cheaply applied (Very dull, not shiny at all.) After putting golf ball through golf ball washer at course, parts of logo scratched off (Ball on left unplayed, ball on right played on one hole and then cleaned.) Ball played well as expected, but I would NOT recommend this company for personalized logos. Very disappointed!"
2.0,After one washing the jammies started to pill and ball up. Pants are huge.
2.0,"The colors and style look nice in person.  Note: the white is an off-white and the back of the dress has somewhat of a &#34;V&#34; line cut.  The dress fit me REALLY tight.  I'm 5'4, 150 lbs with curves and I bought the Large.  The material is that thin cotton that hugs the body.  It showcased too many of my imperfections and didn't look office-appropriate (for me) so I returned it."
2.0,"Very thin material; cheaply made. When I got it, to me, it looked faded almost like it had been worn before, and it' already starting to get little sweater balls"" all over it. Just not too impressed with it"
2.0,"Botton,and stitching arm came off before we if wearing, reordered but came to late so sent it back."
2.0,Small and not as long as the picture looked
2.0,Dress fit as expected but was very cheap looking
2.0,"It was very small and flimsy, it’s more like a credit card holder"
2.0,top is cheaply made - gathering is finished cheap - no gathers in back
2.0,"When I retrieved the package today and opened it one of the arm sleeves was unravelling and defective.  See pictures, there were threads actually hanging out of the package when i opened it."
2.0,"These are really cute, but they’re loud! I put one on my keys and had to take it off because of how loud it was klinking my other keys everywhere I went. Too bad because it was so cute!"
2.0,"I ordered both the wolf and fox pair of slippers for my two little boys. Accurate in color and style is about as good as it gets. While the inside is soft to the touch, there is not much cushion, padding or support. I've officially retired these from the kids after one day of wearing because honestly, they are just dangerous on active children in a house with multiple stairs. There is no elastic around the ankle cuff of these &#34;slippers&#34; so there is nothing keeping these on their feet. The bottom skid resistant nubs are tiny and pretty useless since they don't stay on the feet anyway. They slide off easily and caused one tumble on the floor, and a stumble on the basement steps. Thankfully, it was only the last two and it was my 5 yo who managed to catch himself, but these are a hard No for my boys. These may suit more sedentary kids or maybe the tiniest size for those not walking yet? In any case, very very cute but not at all practical for everyday use.<br /><br />ps - sunlight washed out the color, but the red is a darker true red, not orange looking. Also, don't mind the cat hair..."
2.0,I wish I’d seen the reviews mentioning how LARGE the top portion is. I’m normally a between size of small and medium. This small fit me like a large on top. The smock hangs off me rather than fitting to my body.
2.0,"way too small both in length and width.  They say they are size 11, but they aren't.  Shoes are smaller than what is stated."
2.0,"This is an extremely itchy and cheap sweater. I should have known better to by cheap clothes, but I wanted to try something new. The sleeves are incredibly short and the torso is also boxy. I bought this in black and pink and gave both of them away."
2.0,Obviously ordered the wrong size.  My mistake. Too late to return but I'll make sure I read the description more closely next time.
2.0,"Pretty disappointed, there were not as colorful as pic.  There is no red crystal, didn't like it at all."
2.0,One is chipped and the other is cracked!! That is how they were recieved. Quite disappointing.
2.0,Ripped like in a week of use
2.0,Very tight. Not like reviews stated. Love the print and style though.
2.0,"It was very clingy and not true to size. Product arrived promptly, but did not like it."
2.0,"Material of this slip  is not smooth - it will catch your dress. The slip runs very small//tight and will not keep your dress from clinging. Material is thick and hot. Length is too long - I was hoping for a below the knee length to wear with maxi dresses, but this comes to just above my ankles (I'm 5'2&#34;). This would be OK as an under layer for a sheer dress to provide coverage, but otherwise does not function as a slip."
2.0,Color of collar is faded just after 4 washes.
2.0,"When you first get the skirt, you have to lace up the sides on your own with a cheap cable cord. After I did that I wore it out. It was a struggle to get the zipper up because it kept jamming, then when I finally got the zipper up all the way, it came completely off. I decided to wear it anyway but within an hour, the zipper seam busted open. It is a cute skirt and has good potential. Just the quality of the product is poor."
2.0,"It Won’t stay in the spot where it’s suppose to. Also, they smell bad and I don’t feel safe to use it."
2.0,"Size -  This is designed for bigger and taller women, which is great if that's you, but it swallows a petite.  Even with a 1/2 tuck, it just looked sloppy.  If they want petites to wear it, they'll have to make an XS.<br /><br />Fabric - So, if you pay attention, you'll know this is NOT a cashmere sweater in spite of how they have it listed because the product description says 10% cashmere.  It's a stretch to claim ""cashmere sweater"" in the heading.  Knowing that, I wasn't really expecting cashmere soft.  However, it's itchy - not a lot, but if you wore it, it might be uncomfortable.  I had it on for a total of about 1/2 a minute and noticed the scratchiness.<br /><br />Color - I got the red, and the color is nice - a true red, not an orangey-red.<br /><br />Design - There is a cuff that adds a nice detail if the sweater works for you in other ways.<br /><br />Quality - Seems made well enough.  Again, I only had it for less than a minute before re-packaging it, so I can't speak about how it holds up or launders.<br /><br />Since the sweater wasn't cheap, I'm returning it and paying the extra to upgrade to 100% cashmere.  It's worth the difference for me."
2.0,"For somewhat big but length was good. I’m 5”3, 140#"
2.0,I don’t know who this is jacket is made for but it’s an extremely small cut and tight in the wrong places.
2.0,Very too small.  Wife needs xlarge(sizing charts apparently not too accurate for USA sizing)
2.0,"This belt isn't as comfortable as the Dockers version. I expected it be quite pliable but it is not. Perhaps over time it would ""break in"" but there are other belts that do not require a break in period."
2.0,"Ordered an X/XL, the same size I bought in a Billabong flex hat in 2020, which fit perfectly.  This X/XL flex hat is way too tight.  Sent it back."
2.0,It wasn't at all what I expected..
2.0,"Not a good purchase for me, they are really loos around the legs and bunch up unlike other merino wool underwear."
2.0,It was not what expected
2.0,"First off - it was very small and rather dainty - but still very nice and my son loved it!  The clasp broke within 10 minutes of putting it on.  We have saved the pieces and may yet re-string it, but still only worth getting if you like it enough to consider it a craft project."
2.0,IT'S A WHOLE PC. SUIT & THE UNDERNEITH IS NOT MADE WELL. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
2.0,Material is pretty shear.
2.0,"As big as a man's wrist band.  I am on the second to last hole and the strap wraps all the way around my wrist so I have a double layer all the way around.  Too bulky, not comfortable, and the keepers are a bit big so they slide around.  Nice feel and color.  Wish someone really made a strap for a woman's wrist."
2.0,Way too big! Fall off my husbands face.
2.0,"The top works down as the legs are working up, till they're all bunched up. Very annoying to try to work in."
2.0,Top was ok. A little too big on the bottom of it. Too square shape.
2.0,If I'd not received this as a gift I would be returning it. I ordered my size based on reviews that it fit true to size...if 'true to size' means the same as 'stretched to full ability' then yes it does. This was about 2 full dress sizes too small.
2.0,"I was so excited to get this bra in the mail and rushed in to try it on. I was very disappointed when I found it was very small. I had recently ordered a sport bra that was a size G, which was very roomy and expected the 4 to be similar. I wish now that I had spent a little more money and duplicated the original G bra order. It is so hard to find sizes like these and I got my hopes up. Oh well, I will just hang on to it, in hopes that I will loose enough weight to wear it someday. It's too much trouble to send it back."
2.0,"Really cute necklace, but rusted a week after I received it. It's light, cheap material but it still looks cute."
2.0,The colors are great and the fabric. Not liking the design as it’s a little odd in shape.
2.0,It was so small I had to give it to my 12 year old daughter.
2.0,Went dark
2.0,"The stretchy ones tear apart where they attach to the plastic that goes inside of the watch within weeks. In order for it to not break, I think you'd have to have it looser, but this would give inaccurate heart rate and motion readings. I think these are really cool and comfortable but they just aren't durable enough. I get it for the price but i'd be willing to pay more for added durability. For the price of an apple watch, it's honestly not worth risking it coming apart.<br /><br />The velcro ones are good though so I added a star. But that's as generous I can get - not because I feel like I wasted my money because they don't cost that much - but I just really hate when a company makes me throw away barely used things into a landfill. Make something well before selling it."
2.0,I bought the size based on my measurements and it's too big. I expected a much more snug fit since it's &#34;stretch&#34; material but I have folds and bunches in the fabric and it's awkwardly folded around my calf. Like it wants to be a boyfriend jean but not. So awkward.
2.0,"Normally I rave about Patty Boutik products. I have so many, and so many more on my wish list.  They fit well,  look nice,  and usually last.... but not this one.  It didn't last one wash.  It was washed on delicate cycle,  in a delicates bag, and when I pulled it out of the bag... my heart sank. I'm so sad too, because it looked so good on me. It naturally did the off- shoulder look. It looked just like the model.  All my other Patty products have lasted years and I've washed them all the same way.  I'm hoping it's just a fluke."
2.0,More like pajamas
2.0,"The head of the cane doesn't fit into the cane itself because the diameter of both pieces are exactly the same size.  So, unless you force the pieces together, which would cause the cane portion to split, and tape it together it's not usable.  Don't waste your money on this."
2.0,Way bigger than expected. Continuously fall off my face. Ended up giving them away
2.0,Material is thin and looks very cheap. Returned it immediately.
2.0,there is a rubber thing on the ends of the wrap around part that falls off and won't stay on. And they just fit like crap. But they are just cheap glasses
2.0,I know the price is really cheap but it turned in a matter of like two days of having.
2.0,"These are fine as a coverup. They are Very thin & see through. They also were very long. The picture looked like they were above the ankle...NOT!  For those reasons, I returned the pants."
2.0,"I like the design.<br />I didn't like the fact that the first time I wore it,it broke kmt."
2.0,Button broke the first day I put them on. If u put keys in any one of the pockets your gonna need hedge clippers to cut them out. So many strings in pocket. Seems cheaply made. Would not recommend unless the price dropped to around 12$ bucks or so
2.0,"While the sizing was accurate and they felt comfortable, I did not like the way they looked at all.  They looked weird and cheap.  I will stick to traditional jeans for now."
2.0,Product arrived with pieces missing from it and one of the clasps broken off. Save your money and get a nicer one for a little more! Rating two stars because it does look nice and I can fix it or repurpose it.
2.0,It sheds.
2.0,Sent it back didnt look good on me
2.0,Toooooo little. Can I return it?
2.0,"Size is perfect!  Quality is great. However, the color is deff off!  Expect a “mustard yellow” shirt. It is deff darker than what is shown."
2.0,Didn't fit my body type. Great if you are expecting.
2.0,A cute purse otherwise except for the bottom which is made from un-beaded material. Returning this item.
2.0,"Sadly, these are made for very small adult hands or for children. The pink with gold dotted bangles are quite nice. The packaging is sweet and the entire ensemble would make for a nice gift. Just know for whom you are buying. My hand would be considered medium to large for reference."
2.0,Socks are VERY thin and you can see your toes right through it.  What do you expect for $2 and change. There is nothing spectacular about them. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"Misleading product image.  Uneven seams, pleating doesn't sit flat. It's yellow not gold."
2.0,Too tight for average leg.
2.0,The body of this suit fit well. The chest was too large and the bra cups were awful. The cups were not stitched in so they kept moving around just when trying on. I wear D or DD bra and there was too much fabric so that it was hanging. I had to return this bathing suit.
2.0,Quality was nice but sizing was off compared to other brands like ShirtPunch and Retro Tees.
2.0,Runs small order a size up.
2.0,"Granted I lived in Chicago, and these weren't exactly Red Wings in price/quality, but I expected a book like this to at least last for a season. Instead, the heel busted on a cool night when I was walking home from a bar. I looked into it and it was not even sewn together, just hastily glued or stitched. It's strange because my friend has had a pair of Rocket dog boat shoes for 3 years and they look/feel brand new. Maybe they are just focused on their summer wear instead of their faux-biker looks..."
2.0,It's really baggy and not form fitting like it is on the model. Also lacking the tie in the back. That would have potentially helped the form.
2.0,don't really heat up that much but they are comfortable
2.0,"I bought for my daughters grad from vet school. Needed something that would b comfy n cool in this southern heat.<br />I guess this was not in my size range. I can fit a 18 in reg dept store clothes but for some reason there r too many of these off Size clothes on Amazon.<br />That waist band cut me across my chest. So it’s waaaay off. Other than than issue ,had it fit properly , it would have been a bargain.<br />U get what u pay for."
2.0,"Did not fit right. Made me look fat, it went awkwardly over my chest. Prob works better for small chested/very skinny girls.<br /><br />FYI I got an M."
2.0,Did not grip my belly or waist.. too loose at the top..
2.0,Size was way to big although I used the size chart
2.0,This item looks nothing like pictured. The moonstone looks more like clear quartz the chain is of p.bb 0<br /><br />This item is nothing like the one pictured I know stones vary but this looks more like clear quartz.
2.0,Bought 2 & 1st time wearing both of them 2 of the snap buttons came off! Very good material & comfortable but the snap buttons are garbage!
2.0,Too big not comfortable
2.0,"i'm 6'0"" 173 lbs with a 34"" waist. I ordered the XL, waist is fine but still too short at the ankle, however i can pull these all the way up to my chest and still not have a wedgie. They are also super thin, so not the greatest in winter and the zipper pockets are annoying. Overall, I wouldn't buy again or recommend."
2.0,"The material was nice, but the sleeves were too tight and not as flowy as I had expected."
2.0,"Sun glasses feel of cheaply made plastic although they look very stylish.  Also, although they are advertised as being for small faces, the lenses are relatively large."
2.0,"Sized for a child, cheezy quality"
2.0,They’re uglier in person and they are not comfy to wear. I’ll prolly just throw them out. Super cheap.
2.0,Doesn’t seem to fit foot size properly
2.0,"Snags easily, colors aren't quite so nice as pictures, and WAY too small."
2.0,Fyi..if you like showing skins sides of waist good for you but I don't. Since I'm 6ft tall the side cut hits narrowest part of waist so need high waist bottom. The fabric is thin but not sheer...feels like it might rip fast though.
2.0,"Cute dress, but mine came with a big rip in a seam that I had to fix."
2.0,These are so small they might fit a size 5-6 shoe without making holes in the toes the first time worn.  They do look nice just too small for a size 8 shoe.
2.0,"Size of the hat is small. Also, face protection shield fogs up a lot, not good quality for the price."
2.0,this is no to a 12 months baby.
2.0,"Made of really cheap material. Loose strings sticking out. Stains very easy. Does not work with smaller wrists. Even though it was quite loose on my wrist, it stretched out almost immediately to the point I'm afraid it will just fall off my wrist."
2.0,"I love the look of these tights. However, I only wore them once because they ripped on my first wear."
2.0,"I have had this style totes for several years that I carried with me everyday to work and was used many times.  It has been a faithful umbrella but just recently started acting up by not opening properly.  Purchased this Totes as a replacement but when I opened the new one, one of the beams was already bent causing the umbrella to have a terrible shape. The beams are made of lite weight material which I can understand but to already be bent was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Tried to reshape the beam but I do not believe this will last very long before it will probably break.  This is the reason for the 2 star rating.  Any help......"
2.0,Very cheesy! Took 3 ½ months to get the shirt and when I got it I put it in the goodwill bag. The front part is cut but twisted and sewed in a knot. The leopard part is a cheap material.<br />The shirt is ugly and cheap.
2.0,Had to return them as the plastic part kept slipping off from the glasses.  The chain also broke first time were it was joined to the plastic hook.
2.0,"Necklaces broken within days of wearing,  I guess you get what you pay for"
2.0,heavier than advertised. smaller lens that I would preferred.
2.0,Ordered my normal size and is way to big!  Also the cup liners are malformed!
2.0,it is ok!
2.0,Earloops break when putting on. Mask is enormous and rides up.
2.0,"Ordered high rise and received classic rise. Fit is nice, slacks are soft!"
2.0,"Super pretty, loved it...until less than 2 hours after I put it on and the gold started to wear off. I’d avoid purchasing it."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:2feacd7d96e202b885afdb635b82e01b]] I bought this as a spare dress belt and haven't used it in a year.  Staryed using it and the leather is peeling off in a week.  Comfortable soft leather but its not going to last.
2.0,"These sunglasses are nice to look at, but have have poor durability. My son didn'y use it a few time, but it is broken it in a month. I have to buy another one because of this toy. It is not sunglassses at all."
2.0,This snowman costume is really cute and seemed well made but was way too big for me me  so I had to return it .
2.0,Top would fit an A cup!  Bottom fit great. Love the style but had to return.
2.0,very hard to see . When on the beach I could barely see and having the sun shine bright just make it impossible to see.
2.0,"Strap broke while I was out of country. I was not rough with it and it never had more than maybe 20lbs of things in it(iPad battery backup, sunscreen,asprin.... Of course when I got home I found out I was 1 day outside my return window. So now I am stuck with a defect.  Till the top loop broke, or really it's more like the stitching just let go, it workes well for my needs. That's why it gets 2 stars not one. It is perfect right up till it comes apart."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:50b45b28ea010599046a37d5e3aff4c0]] A little disappointed in these. NOT squat proof as you can see in the video, you can see my butt right through the squat test. The material isn’t as structured as gymshark so they ride up and cause camel toe pretty bad (also in the video). Such a shame because I absolutely love how high-waisted they are and they’re a great length and don’t squeeze my thighs at the seams. I am 5’7, 148 lbs and got a size medium. I will be returning."
2.0,"This is GOLD, not sliver like the picture. After I received it I read the description and it does say (gold). I thought a gold necklace would be pictured if that’s what they were selling."
2.0,"would be a cute dress if the manufacturer cut it straight.  Looks like it was hemmed by a lopsided person. Long in front of knee left leg, short on other, long at another point, shirt in back! Would cost amount the same ammont if money of dress to take to tailor to hem correctly.<br /><br />Be very careful you look at which one and the description these are all different dresses made with different material. They should have to be listed separately. I ordered one color and it was 100% rayon that flimsy material which is fine for summer, I ordered a different color and it felt like cotton which was completely different on my body. The rayon ones seem to run a size bigger. The cotton ones seem to run normal. In rayon I got a medium and it fit. In the cotton one was an extra large and it fit with a little bit of room in my chest extra, and another cotton one I bought in a large and it fits perfectly everywhere except the Hem is lopsided. I'm athletic build"
2.0,"Style wise this shirt is cute. The sizing, however, is definitely off! I used the size chart to determine that I could indeed order my usual size (M). It was way too tight in the bust and arms and was not as long as is pictured. I’m short waisted so I was surprised that the length wasn’t even accurate. I gave this shirt to my daughter who is a true size small & small busted & it barely fit her. I also felt that this shirt was overpriced for the quality.  Buyer beware."
2.0,Didn't feel secure. Kept slipping off as I was walking. Purchase because of the bow.  Ended up using my plain flip flops because they were the only ones that stayed on.
2.0,Nice bag but I have 3 and all of them the strap has ripped off due to the cheap stitching on the strap
2.0,"Careful, it comes smaller that what it states"
2.0,It’s WAY too small. Suited for a child’s wrist
2.0,The shoe is cute. But cut a lil to small. Will try a larger size...get back to you!
2.0,"Comfortable shirt, unfortunately the seams on the sleeves fell apart the first day I wore it!"
2.0,The number is nice but the chain broke the second time my son wore it.
2.0,"Not for big boobs, it stuck just fine, but there was no lift. Avoid. 36DD"
2.0,I'm returning these sunglasses because they are very large on my face and because they feel extremely cheap and flimsy.  I could be wrong about that part--they might last forever.  But they feel like something you would buy a child or win at a carnival.
2.0,Very short and boxy
2.0,"Before I even was able to wear it out, sequins fell off and the ruffles were torn. When I put it on, the skirt was way too long (I had to pull it up to nearly my chest), so I tripped on it all night. I was very unhappy with how cheaply it was made, and the sizing is way off (I ordered to my measurements)."
2.0,way too small for adults.
2.0,Fades out fast!!!!<br />Decal faded to white withen year!!!!
2.0,I would not purchase again.
2.0,"Can't get it tight enough to stabilize.<br />Doesn't stay, keeps loosening up."
2.0,"Belt is really nice and fits great. There is a major design flaw, though. Instead of having the buckle snap facing the back of the belt (like a loop), it's facing the front where all the pressure of the buckle is. Therefore, when you pull on the buckle to latch it to the belt, the snap just comes undone. It's a shame because it really is a nice belt and easily worth 5 stars. But if it doesn't do what it's supposed to do... I bought 2 belts, a brown and a black. They are both the same way."
2.0,"The shirt definitely runs a bit large, but it's a decent quality shirt. The biggest problem though is that the words and images are printed backwards. I went ahead and used it because of time restraints, but I was really disappointed. I would not recommend."
2.0,"Very thin, cheap material."
2.0,"I ordered a size larger than my usual size of 2X and still these camisoles didn't fit. Way too snug everywhere--in the bust, the stomach, and the hips. Very uncomfortable. The only good thing I can say is that they were very soft and the colors were attractive. Too bad they're not designed for REAL women."
2.0,These are really cute and well made for the price but I guess I didn't realize how BIG they'd be.  I'm sure plenty of people wear earrings this big and are comfortable in them so if that's you buy them.  If you like making a statement but not wear earrings almost as big as your head then pass on these.
2.0,This is for kids it's to short for me im 5'10 it like the size of my neck so a little disappointed
2.0,does not look the same as on the model
2.0,They were cute but they broke easily
2.0,"The skirt portion of the dress is perfection. Hugs your curves in JUST the right way. The top is a damn mess. I don't even know how to explain how poorly it fit. Not just size-wise, but structurally. Like it was made improperly. I ended up cutting the top off and buying a crop top and using just the skirt portion for my Halloween costume."
2.0,It is gorgeous and I loved it but after wearing it daily for less than a month it broke where it attaches to my Apple Watch
2.0,"Wore for a few hours on one day and it tarnished/turned bronze. Cute for a picture or two, but don't expect it to last any longer than that - I got one use out of it and it was toast."
2.0,"Aside from being tiny, the stones are a definite green and not blue."
2.0,Fit was as expected<br />Design/print peeled off on some areas as it sticks to itself
2.0,It works well but small. It can be for a small kid.
2.0,"I don't like my lower body feeling like it's a present wrapped up for a special occasion and when I say &#34;Wrapped Up&#34; I mean tightly wrapped.  We did In Vitro and one of the questions asked before was &#34;Do you wear TIGHT Underwear&#34;...  No I don't and I don't like Tight Underwear...  so I don't like these, I'll be giving them to my neighbor since he's a small framed guy and they have 2 kids already....  Maybe he likes tight Underwear because I don't..."
2.0,I should have paid attention to the details before I ordered 2 of them. The seams are on the outside which makes the shirt look sloppy.<br />On a better note the fabric is soft and the colors are nice.
2.0,"Did not experience much difference in normal night driving and driving with these glasses.<br /><br />Some of the oncoming headlight glare from the brighter, white Xenon lights being sold nowadays were slightly minimized, but other than that, not much else to speak of.<br /><br />There was a slight flaw outside the direct field of vision on one of the lenses which should not have made through a quality standards check.  The case, screwdriver, and packaging were nice though."
2.0,Unhappy with the quality of this item and its packaging. Although I suppose for the price someone might enjoy them if quality is not an issue. I purchased some from another resource on Amazon and the difference in the craftsmanship and quality was night and day.
2.0,Yeah I thought these pants would be a lot more epic. The color of these aren’t navy. Not even close. Plus I forgot I even ordered em 😂😂😂 I’ll use these as studio pants.
2.0,long wait doesnt fit boyfriend otherwise nice looking though as a necklace. should come in size choices so can be worn ad ring.
2.0,Comfortable though after less than two weeks use the straps are so stretched that they are unwearable. Not a reliable purchase.
2.0,"I know it's a cheap necklace so I haven't worn it in the shower or gotten it wet at all. However, a lot of the gold color has worn off into a dark silver. Still cute but also very fragile. I wore it as a choker once and sneezed and one of the links broke...fixed it and still wear it from time to time"
2.0,Great colors but I wanted them to fit my masks and eyeglasses. Nope. Tried to put on my glasses and the tip broke immediately. Very disappointed. I’ll keep for masks but not happy I have to order another to fit my glasses.
2.0,The belt was stiff and ran very small.  I ordered a 44 for my son who wears a 40 pant.  The belt barely fit him.  I am returning it.
2.0,"We bought this umbrella and were very excited for it but after assembling it that feeling changed. First, it was missing a important piece of it, the part that covered the gears so that it didn’t rust. Secondly, when you adjust the umbrella so that it covers the top the umbrella rips forward and falls over. You will definitely need to put this in grass an anchor it or put sandbags on it. We had to send ours back because we have kids who play in the backyard and we did not want them to end up getting hurt."
2.0,ldo not fit my cell phone first of all.it's just good for credit n etc. love it because it is coach name brand .
2.0,Looks cheap and bits of the embroidery are unfinished and fall away from the lace. I won't wear this very often if ever.
2.0,"The latch does not hold at all.  It's very pretty - very lightweight. However, it has fallen off several times. Both the clasp and safety latches won't hold."
2.0,"The only real problem with this is the inner lining is longer than the outer lace. This skirt is very transparent so be careful what you're wearing under it! After a quick adjustment on the lining, i really like this skirt."
2.0,"i knew what i was getting into when i purchased this from amazon for a cheap price, so when it came with some stitching screwed up on the shoulder i was not surprised."
2.0,I got this for my husband and he did not like it because it was itching him (bald head) and it was also too large even tho i measured his head circumference and he was on the middle range for the large size.
2.0,"Strong material, wouldn’t be see through and fits nicely on, the only issue is I’m 5’8-5’9 and this only covered enough to be qualified as a shirt. Halloween costume didn’t work out."
2.0,"Poor quality, had to return it"
2.0,I run true tto size this was runs very small as well as very itchy material!!! Not great for curvy girls even thou it appears it should. Lots of bunching in material. Returning product
2.0,Strap ripped away from bag much sooner than it should have
2.0,"So, yes these are clip on earrings, however not solely. If you look at pics 2,4,and 5, notice the clear discs at the bottom of the wings those are  the back for stud piercings. So unless you want to be poking your ears while wearing, need ear piercings"
2.0,No structure...expected a little more
2.0,"My son wanted this for Christmas. He loves the Percy Jackson books! However, it lasted less than a month. I debated on reviewing this but thought I'd give my 2 cents. If you do order this, be cautious. I'm going to ask a friend who makes her own jewelry if she can fix it because he was disappointed that he can't wear it anymore."
2.0,"It wasn't the sword itself, it was the way they packaged it... I received more than a beaten box and a sword that was too big for the box, thus causing it to fit.  My son still enjoyed it, but it wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
2.0,Didn’t like the cheap material. It’s hot . Not like descibed
2.0,"Weird, tiny pockets and the fly is so high; runs small"
2.0,"Not great quality, the edges aren't surged or finished off in any way. The label on the back of the bottoms also HURTS. Scratches soo bad, and there's no way to cut it off all the way so it will scratch no matter what. It also fit me weird, but I am very ""blessed"" so I don't blame the design. It still looks cute on though."
2.0,It's smaller than I expected
2.0,"Pretty disappointed in this product. The fit and sole are great. But the lacing system is weak. It snapped on one shoe within 60 running miles. Unlike a shoe lace, you can’t easily replace. Outside of the return window now, so it’s just money down the drain unless I can rig up some kind of replacement system. Bummer!"
2.0,"I don't know, it doesn't really look the same as the image. I guess I will have to plug it in and see how it fits."
2.0,I wear a medium but ordered a large.  I could not even button the shirt it was so tight.  Had to return the item.
2.0,The style and look were nice and  as I expected. The glasses broke as I was attempting to put them the third time. This led me to look closely at the area of breakage and left me feeling the quality may not be too good. I would not buy this product again.
2.0,The picture and the package don't match. Ordered a M and could have put 2 of myself in them.
2.0,"1.  Does not count as mask for FAA, ports or California public spaces  2.  Fogs. 3.  Uncomfortable"
2.0,I don’t know I have never felt leather like this. I sent it back. Is looks cheap.
2.0,"Decent quality, too small compared to the sizes listed"
2.0,I bought these for my husband. I gave 2 stars for the price which was the best part about the product. When worn the legs are much shorter than they appear on photo. After 1 wash and one wear underwear had small holes all around band. I will not be purchasing any more of these.
2.0,"It has a 'boxy' fit. The fabric has a semi burnout finish, of which I'm not a fan. This Carbon Heather/Black t-shirt was most disappointing, as after the first wash in liquid laundry detergent, turned inside out, on a delicate cycle, the dye got splotchy on some parts of the t-shirt. Very disappointing quality from Under Armour. The 2 start rating is solely for the great message on the t-shirt... but thats about it."
2.0,I usually give good reviews BUT the sizing on these socks are WAY off !! The quality is great but I can't wear them. I gave them to my wife. Sorry !
2.0,"Small size was also loose. They do not have XS  size. so overall little bigger. Fabric quality is average, not as good as high end party wear but good for casual wear."
2.0,"Not what I was looking for. The sleeves weren't fitted like the pic, they were like bell bottoms and billowed out. The scalloped hem is also a little tattered looking. Like a kid's witch costume. Not a fan but can't argue at that price!"
2.0,My phone barely fit. It's too small. I bought the gold one from Macy's and black one from amazon. You will see it better in pictures. It was so disappointing when I open the package. I give 2  stars just for the quality.
2.0,It's way too small for me
2.0,"It's not that it did not work...but if you have a high end watch that has a linked band that you cannot expand or contract, this will not work for you."
2.0,I have owned many Eddie Bauer shirts. This one is not cut or shaped like the others I have owned. I doubt that I will be able to wear it past today as washing it will make it a little bit smaller and too small for me to wear.
2.0,Very nice sexy style. But sweater I ordered was XL. & I wear a lg & still came small as size of M. Fits USA bodies. Different so order 2/3 sizes larger 2 fit.
2.0,"Being 5'11&#34;, the sleeves were too short. Plus, I did NOT like the material--thick and stiff, not cozy at all. Will be returning."
2.0,"All 3 different sizes,also have different lengths"
2.0,"Love the shirt, but it’s HUGE!"
2.0,"This was supposed to come with “6 unique hair ties” that did not show up, love the idea, disappointed that it didn’t all show up :("
2.0,"Did not stay in position after a few wears,  became loose"
2.0,Very hard to use. The tattoos did not work after following instructions very closely.
2.0,Stained
2.0,II followed the instructions but two of the corners melted.
2.0,"This kitty cat costume is really thin and not great quality.  I'm pretty sure a handmade one out of cloth would be better.<br />THE TAIL<br />The tail is just a tube of fabric with no filling or wire.  It's small and very limp. It is about 9 inches long so it's fine for a small child, but in no way suitable for an adult. It flops around and droops.<br />BOWTIE<br />The bow tie is also small at about 4 inches long.  You could probably put it as a bow tie for a small dog or cat, but I wouldn't recommend it..  It will probably stretch big enough for a small human (child) but is tight on a normal neck.<br />CAT EAR BAND<br />The cat ears, again, are just a thick fabric on a band.  The fabric is thick enough to be stiff, but it's barely above just having felt ears, and I'm sure handmade high quality felted ears would be much better.<br /><br />In short, this is a set that you'd most likely find at a dollar store if you were to shop around Halloween.  I don't understand why it's being sold on Amazon for almost $10 USD.  It's definitely not worth that price.  Avoid getting this unless you absolutely NEED to get a quick cat costume for a child.  It will be a waste on an adult and again, this is pretty low quality.  You can find higher quality costumes even at SPIRIT Halloween or any big box store during the autumn season.  There's nothing ""lux"" about this."
2.0,I'm not a fan of the cheap feeling top. It feels like I could have made a better version of this if I had a sewing machine and picked out nicer fabric. We kept it anyways because we liked the Jean shorts for my toddler.
2.0,Ordered two sizes larger than I needed and it fit perfect. Wore twice without washing between wears and already has elastic strings poking out. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Poor Quality. This underwear will loose shape very soon. No comfort !!!
2.0,Cute piece but after one wash all the edges started to fray really badly and the ruffle in the front started to tear away from the neckline. Poorly made
2.0,The body of the skirt is beautiful. The waistband is very tight and does not stretch. The skirt probably would have fit me if they used an actual elastic waist band. I could only get the skirt up just past my knees.
2.0,"The price was pretty decent, but this wasn't quite what I was expecting.  The headband runs a little small and the trunk I received was tiny and crooked. I'll be returning this item."
2.0,Alot thinner than what looks in picture
2.0,"Loved this suit, except that the zipper broke after 3 wears. Another reviewer said that theirs broke after 6-7 wears, so this must be a consistent thing. Shame because I would give it 5 stars otherwise because it was vibrant and fit great, but it doesn't last long."
2.0,"ok, short, boobs too small!!"
2.0,It's a useful product and design is elegant but parts came damaged.
2.0,Very cute but some details got lost being so small.
2.0,ran way small.  I'd say they were more like a medium than an xl.
2.0,"Quality was not nearly as good as expected, so I returned the product."
2.0,Didn't like how it fit
2.0,The entire stitching of the lining came apart. The center pocket ripped from the side. The exterior pocket separated from the let her.
2.0,Got the wrong hat
2.0,gets holey to fast
2.0,Not impressive.  Not like pictures
2.0,"Literally broke so quick, it was cute then broke so kinda sad"
2.0,"They are made of cheap material and are big (about 3 inch long, making people looking like having short neck) and very heavy."
2.0,Hat fits great but is not brown more like a rust color.  But is a really nice cap and comfortable.
2.0,"Pros: super stylish, fit well, lightweight.<br />Cons: I think they make my vision worse? Words on the screen have a slight blur when I wear these. They also reflect very badly so your eyes aren’t visible if your on a zoom call. I’ve tried these off and on for weeks and think I’ll have to return them and try something else."
2.0,Quick delivery.<br /><br />Not impressed but kept them as I have no other St Patty's Day earrings.
2.0,shoulder straps broke when I tried it on.  Had to sew them back on.  I used as a coverup for a cruise.  Very cute but would be a one time wear kinda dress... cheap and thin
2.0,I have long hair and it fits way to tight. if u got a big head like me don't buy it.
2.0,"i wish i loved this, but i don’t. the feathers fall off way too easily, and it’s way bigger than i thought it would be and i thought i got the correct size for me. the stitching on it is kinda weird and it’s all around not as flattering as the picture."
2.0,"Tight fit, bought another brand in same size scales, much looser fit than these were."
2.0,"Soft Fabric initially but, as you continue to wear and wash, it gets deteriorated quickly. One of the snap button has sharp edge on it so that’s no good when I hold my newborn"
2.0,It sheds all over. I've never seen shedding like this ever?
2.0,"They look very pretty on the picture online. However, I can't say the same once I got them. I got different colors and different sizes because I was not sure which size was going to fit me better. None fit good. They are not of good quality, the fabric seems cheap. They are not well made. I am a seamstress myself and when I buy clothes is not easy because I can find all the faults. Can't saw any longer because of back issues. I love the style, the colors but to my regret, I had to return them all. The only thing I like is the colors of the sheer part which is not the same as the bottom part. The top is darker and it doesn't look so bad but the jersey they used is not good at all. I was very disappointed because I was so excited about them. I planned to buy two different colors. They are not like the picture."
2.0,These are not depression tanks.  They are more like light weight tops.
2.0,I have a big booty they ripped after one use.<br />Not for the big booty ladies.
2.0,To start the thing is pink where it is supposed to be red.  It’s an image printed on on some kind of rubbery plastic and glued to a thumbtack like pin.
2.0,"I didn't get to wear them for more than a couple days, and the threading had already started falling apart."
2.0,"Nice for a one time outfit. The stitching quality is poor, the material is similar to a with costume. This is also a very short dress so wear spanks. I am 5'4 and 125 pounds. I got a small because the back would not fit right if I got a medium. I am more disappointed with the overal quality of the material and threading. I am nervous to put this in the dryer out of fear it will Shrink."
2.0,Two tight and clinging
2.0,Looks very cheap.  Like cheap costume jewelry.
2.0,They stretch out really easy.. don't get me wrong I like beanies a little loose but this is way too much
2.0,"These are adorable! They fit perfectly<br />Have more cushion than I was expecting which is awesome<br />I really like them<br /><br />UPDATE: I've used these a couple of hours for<br />About 5 days<br />The arch on the left foot has lifted up. I have sensitive feet and feeling something in the arch of my foot constantly is very bothersome. Also both of these have flatten out a lot, to the point it that I feel like I'm wearing warm flip flops. Hoped they would have been better."
2.0,i dislike this product because it didn't have cotton crutch.
2.0,The lining on the white dress shows through SIGNIFICANTLY. Cannot figure out how to minimize the effect of that and make it look decent. Missed the return window so I’m stuck with it. Not happy.
2.0,Legs are too full
2.0,It is not a light brown like the picture it is pink!
2.0,"Was really loose fitting - order a size smaller. Also the fabric was very stiff, didn't flow well at all."
2.0,"Feels like putting your foot in a shoe BOX...not a shoe. Looks like a great boot, feels like a box, and looked too big on my feet.  Watch out, I now have to pay to send these back and I have Prime, they caught me not paying attention to the ""Third party only"" sellers deal...kinda irritated about this nonsense. ...Also, my daughter was sending merchandise back on other items[not related to these boots] that were supposed to be packed and shipped by UPS for free and they tried to charge her $27 dollars! She told them to take it off the system, she'll get her own box!!!"
2.0,The cut out for a straw was off centered and the material is good
2.0,"This dress is very soft and comfortable but it is a shame that looks very ugly in little fat tiny persons. I'm 5', 30"" waist 36D bust, I followed the size chart and ordered size M, but is too large for me."
2.0,"No way these should be considered plus size. I'm barely plus sized, usually a size 14, and these were ridiculously small. Soft, yes, but it doesn't matter how soft they are if they don't fit."
2.0,Limited sizes
2.0,Just wasn’t right frumpy like
2.0,looks cheap in person.<br />fit way too big
2.0,Very tight and uncomfortable. Returned it.
2.0,really short an small
2.0,"This is not linen, some kind of stiff, plasticky nylon or something that doesn’t breathe at all. It is simultaneously too small and too large. Arms are a little longer than typical proportions would need, and it’s tight through the torso. Overall, if you’re looking for an affordable linen shirt - look somewhere else."
2.0,These glasses Aee not metal. They are plastic. I returned them.
2.0,This bag was well constructed however the clasp to lock the flap broke off on 2nd use.  Similar complaint others had but guess I had to find out for myself.  Worked well when i needed to just have my S9 and ID and credit cards.  Returning - will not replace because i think this is an inherent problem with how the bag is put together
2.0,"So I'm firstly disappointed in this because it was supposed to come with a waist belt sash rope. This item was not included. The main costume is way bigger than I was expecting based off the size chart as well; I normally wear a large shirt in mens- I'm 5'4&#34; 200lbs and I'm swimming in this thing. If it had come with the waist sash like it was supposed to, then I could have at least hoisted it up and tightened it to fit. The material of the costume itself is good, and the hood fits my head fine. Just wish it came with all the things I paid for it to come with."
2.0,"I'm so disappointed with these! I am 5'5"" and these don't even come up to my knees.  They only reach 3"" below the knee. They are so short, that they are uncomfortable.  I would only recommend these to a person who is short in stature."
2.0,"The gloves are okay, but the wrist velcro is far too large.  I ordered a medium.  The finger length is fine, but my wrist would have to be at least an inch bigger around for the velcro to work.  If I order a small, the fingers will be too short.  Disappointing."
2.0,I ordered glasses with purple color of lenses. Instead of this I got dark blue lenses. At least thank you for right color of frame...
2.0,Necklace broken apon arrival but other than that pretty
2.0,From far away this case looks beautiful. When you look at it closer it looks cheap. The quality of the design is not the best.
2.0,Waaaaaay too small. Had to return.
2.0,"Personally, I find this Filgate wallet/coin purse to be a bad design. These snaps get to be a real pain after awhile and they don't seem to snap that easily either. So, yeah, I don't like this type of wallet/coin purse. The leather is nice though and some people may like it."
2.0,"I love the cut and style of these, but the fabric is awful! Just out of the package, they are full of static! The material doesn't feel like a clothing fabric - it feels like the packing cubes and toiletry bags I have."
2.0,Thought I was cute until A STRANGER POINTED OUT I HAD A HOLE IN MY DRESS!
2.0,I orders a size bigger and this shirt was too small.
2.0,Way too fluffy!
2.0,No para uso prolongado. No protegen del sol.
2.0,Sunglasses peeling already after only having them a short while.
2.0,This was the first time ordering this brand I usually order envole brand the tanks were very tight and I bought xl
2.0,"The seam on the sleeve by the hand is messed up. It is bumpy not smooth. This should have been caught by quality control. But I guess it didn't cost much, I wish I would have spent a little more and got a nice one."
2.0,"I know this isn't necessarily fair to take stars away for this but these are HUGE so I am rating my personal experince with these!  I have a large head (or so I thought) but these even look ridiculous on my huge cranium.  I wear about an 8&#34; in fitted baseball caps for reference.  If you have a really big head and find it hard to find glasses that fit, these might just be for you.  They also seemed a little lightweight like they wouldn't last very long though they are too big for me to wear so I am speculating."
2.0,Thin & clingy material. Looks super cheap. Construction does not look good. I didn't even try it on; I was turned off right out of the bag. I'll be passing on this one.
2.0,"Color is good, nice and pink but way to big for my face, will never wear :(  !! If you like big lens's then these will work for you!"
2.0,"So pretty!  But there’s something about the design that made them hang wrong,  facing downward.  If you bend the hoop to change that,  the keeper no longer meets the top hoop.  Sadly I returned them."
2.0,"Bought this T shirt for a music festival and didn't even get to show it off, unpacked it and it had a nasty brown stain like a water stain and the light that came with it didn't even work. Wish I would have been able to wear this shirt."
2.0,IT FELL OFF AND NOW I CANT FIND IT AT TARGET
2.0,These looked awful on me and felt awful. I returned them.
2.0,Received this watch on September 6th very nice the only problem I have with it is that it's only been a month and already one of the diamonds is falling out that doesn't make me very happy
2.0,"Some sort of translucent protective coat started to peel off after around 8 to 10 months of use. Aesthetics was compromised since the parts without it became a mat color. Also make me thing about any release of chemicals due<br />to the fact the skin contact made it peel off.<br /><br />They look nice and are fun to use, but not a product that can last."
2.0,"Four pairs of hoop earrings arrived as pictured and the colors were as described. Good value as well. However, I'm not sure why but they hurt my ears when I wear them. It's not an allergic reaction. I think it may be the shape and the finish. The posts don't seem to be too wide but they seem that go from narrow to a little wider rather than staying thin all the way throughout. Also, I can see some scratches on the finish of the posts so not sure if that's also bothering my ears. All four pairs had these same characteristics. Thought about returning but not sure if it's worth the hassle"
2.0,The logo was printed on the INSIDE of the onesie! We had to turn it inside out and cut out the tag to make it work. Bad workmanship.
2.0,Super cute design but cheaply made. Every piece fell apart during the first day of west.
2.0,The bottom pocket is a joke!  The design is beautiful. Am sending it back.
2.0,"Bought these for a dance recital costume and was super disappointed. Despite the size running small and quality not the best if you actually wanted to wear them outside, I was mostly upset because the white gloves are actually cream."
2.0,This is not a sweatshirt at all. It is a long sleeved tshirt made of cheap material. Returning
2.0,"Like the way they feel, pull on and look but I've worn through the heels on several different pairs in 3 months...I cannot recommend based on this..."
2.0,I would rate this as a 5 but I have had 2 of these bands and on each one the band pulls out of the metal clasp after a few months.  The band is comfortable and easy to adjust for size but being unreliable makes me nervous to trust security of my watch to this band
2.0,"I purchased this on recommendation from several fashion bloggers, but the light just isn't bright enough to really light up my Speedy 25 and 30.  It also doesn't turn on with most movement, so I ended up digging in a dark bag for the light, so I could squeeze it on and then dig for the actual item I needed.  Boo.<br /><br />I ordered a competitor (Wasserstein auto sensor) and it's much brighter, and the sensor is super sensitive.  Plus it has the clip, which works better in my bags."
2.0,"Impossibly small, even at the larger size, and I'm very familiar with asian clothing sizes and fits, having lived in Japan for 2 years."
2.0,"does not look like the picture which shows a distressed type of cotton.  This was just a plain tan v neck tshirt, and sleeves are shorter than they appear in pics also"
2.0,Cheap!!! Broke after one wear.
2.0,"Does not look like the picture.  Looks like a very cheap tshirt and the collar is a solid white band around the top, not like the picture.  The bottom of the shirt in the picture looks a little flowy, but this is a straight down type tshirt."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:c08d127ba6aa182d80597a818ed5626]] for reference, i am 5'2"", 36B, 160lbs. knowing asian sizes and how small their models are, i went ahead and requested this even though it is a L, i usually wear a US Medium and fit comfortably in them. i mispoke in the video i said it's an XL but this is a Large!<br /><br />this top even though very baggy and roomy around the belly and the chest area, it is very restricting around the arm/shoulder area. when you put your arm forward, you can't fully extend your arm forward and i don't like that feeling, it's supposed to be something you will only feel if your top is too tight.<br /><br />the long shapeless sleeve is not flattering you are short and chunky. you will lose any body shape or confidence you have. just not a good look. as far as the color, i'm not a fan either.  for a scarf maybe? but not for a top.<br /><br />hope this helps."
2.0,I’m 5’9” with 38 DD so I ordered the XL. From crotch to shoulder it was a little tight but nothing too bad with the straps loose. The cup size however is HORRIBLE! Since there isn’t option for cup just band size I wouldn’t recommend if you’re larger in the chest. If I placed myself correctly in the underwire I was completely overflowing the bra. Very sad since I was hopeful this would work
2.0,Too cheap for the price. I wouldn't buy a designer labeled top either if it was cheap material. Better clothes at JC Penny.
2.0,"Hat came flattened out with creases.  The balls on top had fallen off and had to be glued back on.  The feathers were thin, stiff, and ugly.  I salvaged the hat by taking it apart and adding feathers from Michaels. It came out okay, but not without a lot of effort."
2.0,The design of the faux leather belt tip catches on the belt loops of the pants making removel a hassle.  I don't wear it as often as I could.
2.0,"When I receive my earrings, they wasn't as big as I thought. There 2 small 4 me. I like the earrings I just wish they were a little bit bigger."
2.0,This product was very much smaller than the sizing chart stated.
2.0,These work ok but the elastic that goes over your biceps will start to get annoying after a few hours and leaves a really big mark.  I'd probably go for a different brand.
2.0,"Purchased a few days before kids going back to school in an effort to help protect them from Omicron. They fit nicely. But I have little faith in their effectiveness. These are thin, surgical masks. Product is made in China — the definition of a KF94 is that it is made in Korea. I would return the product if I could, but I already opened and had kids try them on."
2.0,Good quality but too small - weird at top....Normally I wear 6 or 7 in regular panties
2.0,"The dress is a great material, however, it runs large on the top area - I am a 34d and it was big. Secondly, the pockets do not set flat on the dress and kind of stock out"
2.0,"way too long, strange seam in back, and bizarre sleeves. Not as shown in pictures.  I returned."
2.0,I ordered a XL just in case it was too small. It was very very small. Material was too lite
2.0,Thought I was ordering a hard glasses case. Was disappointed that it was a soft cloth case.
2.0,"I like the way it looked. However, it felt cheapealy made. I didn't like the fabric."
2.0,Still fog up glasses
2.0,Fits like a garbage bag. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Though very similar looking to the picture, what I received was not the same sweater. Will be returning"
2.0,"Did not fit right. Too big, returned"
2.0,"Hoodie is lightweight and soft.  The neckline is weird, won't buy more."
2.0,Quality is substandard... Price is too good to be true.
2.0,"I recently purchased this bikini and i unfortunately wasnt impressed by it. There is absolutely no elastic in them. In the tops, the triangle pieces are too small, the string is way too small, i barely had enough to tie behind me. And i had to tie it really tight to hold up my chest.  I purchased this size based off the chart provided. The bottoms have an excess amount of string on them and dont cover much. And since there is barely any elastic in them it doesnt feel like its securely attached to me. The fabric feels thin and cheap. I would use this for spray tans but would not wear this in public. I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review."
2.0,Awkward fit. It would be better if it was looser at the seam to hide the pockets better.
2.0,The color is pretty but they run small.
2.0,"The pin on the buckle is just a millimetre too short. It rests on top of the buckle barely, but with the play in the strap, if it moves a fraction from perpendicular, it slips off the buckle, and under, so that the strap becomes loose. Have this happen a few times, and you're ready to throw it in the bin."
2.0,Not true to size had to return
2.0,Not as wide as my 8 year old grandson would have liked. He's average weight and height. More for a child under five.
2.0,"Fit is fine but does not look like picture. Color is a lighter green, also shape does not look the same, pockets are bulky. But I will keep it to wear around the house."
2.0,"Wth. So disappointed with nursemates. They used to make really great compression socks and put out a great product every product. Compression socks are not supposed to look like my dad wearing crew socks. So the tops just end up digging into my calf and defeat the purpose of compression. What happened, Nursemates?"
2.0,Started to fall apart after 1 wash
2.0,Slim fit .. high and tight crotch area. Cut for women seems like
2.0,This is definitely not COMPRESSION- this is cling to your fat rolls and definitely not cute- I use em for bed or under another shirt. Way disappointed.
2.0,"This shirt has no trench so my boobs were super squished together. Also, the neckline was much higher than expected."
2.0,Sup r cute but when I got them they were all falling apart. Had to glue them back my self.
2.0,3 of the 10 are stuck together.  Leg won’t pull down to insert pearl.
2.0,"The pant style is cute however.. they are not designed for all body types as they will accentuate what you do and don’t have.<br />The material is so incredibly thin that it’s almost see through. Not only will panty lines show easily but so will every lump and curve on the body. The pants also accentuate the booty, so if you have a flat butt, these pants will enhance that.<br />On the other hand, these are great pants for someone who’s in wonderful shape with a nice behind.<br />The green is more of a murky olive color and isn’t the best shade of green.<br />They are longer in length but because of the front slot would look best with heels anyway.<br /><br />I’m incredibly underwhelmed and unimpressed by the overall quality and design of these pants"
2.0,Just received swimsuit and disappointed that the stripes on the sides seams don't match up.  I was hoping the quality would be the same as Hanna Andersson but not even close.
2.0,Queda demasiada pequeña la encargue L siendo M en otras blusas por miedo a que me quedara pequeña y me quedo ajustada.
2.0,very stiff and too small
2.0,"Definitely not as dark as the picture, maybe more pink. It’ll work for what we need it for but probably wouldn’t recommend."
2.0,"These gloves would be great but the apparently have a different idea of red than I do. They were a pink color, not red. Bright hot pink. I needed red for a costume. Will send them back in all probability!"
2.0,"Glad it was cheap. Buckle/clasp broke in just 3 weeks from receiving it. Otherwise, looks nice."
2.0,"The 20 gauge nose studs were actually 18g and could not be used, unfortunately. The assortment is so wonderful so I am very bummed."
2.0,No way the shirt fits. My arms don’t even go thru the arm holes. They are way to small. I threw away the bag so I’m stuck with it. But be warned!!
2.0,One of the Item's post's were sticking out of packing when arrived. Post's were also bent.
2.0,Very poor quality & not worth buying!
2.0,"Purchased primarily for sun protection; gap between ""cat ears"" makes it difficult not to expose forehead, causing what would otherwise be a well-functioning and comfortable product to need constant adjustment to maintain proper placement; not very useful through a significant part of the shield's downward settings (the range making it closest to face)"
2.0,Does not fit torso.
2.0,"I’m torn on these pants, ironically the pants themselves are also torn, literally. The pants are cuter than I expected, the fit is flattering and the legs aren’t over voluminous like some similar styles I’ve tried. The fabric was a surprise, I expected a more breathable woven fabric, but they are a slippery stretch fabric with the tie dye design printed on. They feel like a lighter, looser swim suit material. The fabric is light and so not hot, but also not breathable and this a little swampy in humidity. Generally nice and comfy if it’s not muggy. The biggest disappointment however is the fact that they have a couple holes where the seams weren’t properly stitched. Overall they work for lounging on dryer days but the quality isn’t great even compared to similarly priced options."
2.0,It's really a nice-looking bag seems as though didn't get color in this area on strap very disappointing and also very noticeable
2.0,Very small. More child-like.  I thought it was longer and bigger.
2.0,They were not easy to assemble and some tore while assembling. I would not recommend them
2.0,Seems like it was used. The zipper was open and the folding was rough
2.0,"The plastic size adjuster broke, it won’t stay tight to the wrist. My 11 year old son wore it, he’s not overly rough but it only lasted a couple weeks. He really liked it though."
2.0,"Hole in pocket, material on top is very thin and almost see thru."
2.0,I'm 5'7 they barely touched the floor & had a hole in them. I'm dissatisfied to say the least
2.0,Cheap feel synthetic material. Runs small
2.0,"Wasn’t tight around my butt, very loose. The top part looked awful. Material was very cheap and looked very cheap"
2.0,Won't work on haeaver material.
2.0,"This outfit works great in theory. Unfortunately, in actuality an outfit like this with suspenders is going to be very hard for a child to keep on. My daughter didn’t last more than eight minutes in this before she started pulling at the suspenders. I ended up returning it because there’s no way I would even be able to take her out in this kind of an outfit. So very cute to look at  unfortunately, in actuality an outfit like this with suspenders is going to be very hard for a child to keep on. My daughter didn’t last more than eight minutes in this before she started pulling at the suspenders. I ended up returning it because there’s no way I would even be able to take her out in this kind of an outfit. So very cute to look at but not practical for an infant."
2.0,"Does not fit, way too big on me. I am 5’ flat and 114 lbs, got a small and it was still way to big on me, I had to return it."
2.0,The material of the dress in front's seam does not match up with the pattern.  I received this last spring and left on a trip.  I forgot about the dress as I left it in the packaging and was not pleased with how it is sewn.
2.0,"They are a little too small to completely cover my glasses.  Cute, though."
2.0,"Does run small, BUT not 3-D at all! The hoodie does serve the purpose but because of the material it’s not made for cold temps."
2.0,"They were really cheap so that's a plus. They look cheap (like colored glass) and the necklace seems very fragile. Broke one of the metal bands very easily with little force.<br /><br />Not bad for the price; but, don't expect anything quality."
2.0,"This dress has a pretty pattern, but it's only on one side. I knew that, but it looks strange in person. It was much too large. I'm 5'5, with a 35&#34; bust (32DDD), a 25&#34; waist, and 26.5&#34; hips. The small fit like a medium or maybe even a large. I was swimming in it. I also thought the thick polyester type fabric was strange and not flattering. Too bad! I really wanted to like this dress!"
2.0,"Comfortable, but only wore 5-6 times and already has a hole along the heel seam.  Customer service was non responsive."
2.0,"It’s not a sweater, it’s made with like a nylon or spandex material. Very light weight, needs another shirt underneath."
2.0,I got one with a pattern. The fan rich is awful. Feels similar to the material they make sleeping bags out of. It is not lined like the other versions and hangs on my body like a tent. There is zero movement to this fabric and it is not breathable at all which makes it uncomfortable to wear when it’s hot.
2.0,It is what it is...very VERY light weight. Comes in a tiny cheap box with scotch tape to keep it closed. Not worth the money at ALL! Looks and feels cheap.
2.0,"I washed this when I first got it, and wore it for a few hours. Second wash it looked ok, but during the second wear I got a snag in it from my ring on the front. Barely touched it and boom, huge snag. I tied off the snag, clipped it and hoped for the best. But after the 3rd wash I notice the ruffle on the right sleeve is ripping off.<br />I really like the way this fits, and how it looks. It is so comfortable. I wish is was more durable."
2.0,"Ordered a second pair, because I liked the first pair so much.  The material on the second pair was not the same quality.  Not as soft & I could see- through them unstreatched.  Balling & pilling before the first wash.  I suppose that's the risk we run when buying an unlabelled product direct from China. :-(<br /><br />It's too bad too, the first pair was quite nice.  The fit was perfect.  High wasted and I didn't find myself pulling them up all the time.  Flattering and super soft.<br />Me:  either a size small or med,  5/6 or 7/8 depending on brand.  Height: 5'6&#34; - Weight: about 150 -  Shape:  &#34;Apple&#34;  (aka: big round belly, thin butt & thigh region)."
2.0,"Very nice wide toe box, which I need, however the entire shoe is wide (does not taper in at instep), which doesn’t work for me. I have a wide forefoot, narrow instep and ankle. These shoes looked like ferry boats on me :-) the green color is super pretty and the material seems high quality."
2.0,"Well, you get what you pay for... I am sticking with leather bands, this silicone is horrible looking"
2.0,"The online photos make this top look so much better than it does in person. I ordered the XL in black and it is nothing special at all. The fabric is slightly opaque and has a muslin/gauzy texture to it. It needs to be steam pressed or gently ironed. It is a wide and short shirt, however no where near the size measurements across the chest for the XL. The XL that I got is barely a 40"" chest, which per their own item listing size guide is a size medium. This cut/style is not attractive, it is boxy and shapeless. The folded collar is kind of chunky and looks weird. It definitely looks like a very cheaply made garment. I do not recommend this top. It took about 10 days to arrive."
2.0,"Fabric is super thin, to the point that it feels like it might rip if I don't cut my nails. I guess it can be great for summer but will never buy again."
2.0,I do not recommend this product. I have bought a lot from this company and this is the only shirt a I not recommend. It seems they just pieced fabric together and sold it!
2.0,"My husband says he likes the idea of them but they do run on the small size. He's got a football player build and we ordered a 3x... they fit more like a Large to be honest. Great if you want them to be fitted but if you're looking for something more loose and relaxing, these aren't the pants you're seeking."
2.0,"Ordered on December 30.... recieved February 20th. Took almost 2 months to get.<br />They are pretty, but much thinner than expected and holey around the hand. Good for fashion material, not warmth."
2.0,The dress fit well but the front panel was split/torn. Can't order another one because now my size is out of stock. Boo.
2.0,"Chain is super cheap and broke the first time my daughter wore it.  I was able to fix it, but one day?"
2.0,I was initially happy with my purchase but one of the stones fell out.
2.0,"The back lace flaps and is super loose. Everywhere else fits great though. I got a medium, I’m 5’4” 130lbs and 32DD. Will be returning it."
2.0,"If you put your hands up, you’ll flash your tits to the world. So, yes, the size fits as expected but the design of the crop top itself is just bad—unless you wear a tank top under? Or are all about freeing the nipple."
2.0,it fades
2.0,The leggings are SO thin. I would wear them at home but won’t leave the house with them on.
2.0,I ordered this piece and it would have been a smash only if it fitted I am 5 9 and 3/4 in tall and about 236 lb I am a full figured stallion and I wanted to rock this beautiful piece but it was just a little too snug for me it would be nice if they made this for a full figured women
2.0,"The color is very nice. But this t-shirt is thin, and very long. I don't think it's pretty enough to wear with shorts or skirts. It looks sloppy and thin. I am using it for a sleeping shirt."
2.0,I did not like it because of the price to me it feels WAY too night around my necks like its going to snap
2.0,Cute but turned fingers green quickly.
2.0,"Too thick, too heavy"
2.0,"The picture looks light blue, but it was a cream color and of poor material."
2.0,"Very cute, but these earmuffs slip off my ears every couple of seconds, so they're pretty much non-functional."
2.0,"Gold was too yellow and it had a few bubbles..disappointed,  apart from that the set would have been a lovely set to sell backnowledge as I had planned now I'm stuck with it."
2.0,"This dress was way too small - I ordered the same size I have with other dresses, but could barely pull the dress over my head because it was so incredibly small."
2.0,"My 98 yesr old mother that has the almost same slippers from years ago, loved her wore out slippers, but could not get her feet into these new slippers. She was so disapointed."
2.0,Good seller. I actually received two pairs of the stuff with one price.<br />But maybe my leg is too fat. It is hard to put them in and hard to wear. Not quite comfortable especially as the description said overnight.
2.0,"This case does NOT fit a Surface Pro 3.  Otherwise a well made case, but if you have a Surface Pro 3, move along."
2.0,Bow broke off
2.0,Difficult to insert in my nose. I kept slipping out of my fingers. Gave up. Will attempt again....maybe. 😟
2.0,Fit was small and looked really strange on. I returned it!
2.0,Is too tight for like ordered a large. Size up to 1x would have been great. Runs way small.
2.0,"Honestly, this garment runs about 2-3 sizes too small."
2.0,Beautiful color. Stiff material
